Original (Gameplay Comparison)", "description": "Mafia: Definitive Edition is a complete remake of the original 2002 game. Sporting new graphics, a revised story, and updated gameplay that puts it on par with Mafia III, this remake captures what made the original game such a standout experience, while also modernizing it for today's age. Developer Hanger 13 has been working on the Definitive Edition since 2017, and with the September release, this revisit to the original story will round out the current iteration of the Mafia trilogy, which recently saw remasters for both Mafia II and III.\n\nIn this gameplay video, we're taking a detailed look at how the Definitive Edition revitalizes the story of Tommy Angelo and his rise to power within the Salieri crime family in the city of Lost Heaven. It's a substantial rework of the game, and we show off a side-by-side with some of the opening's key scenes to display how the remake updated the original. Right from the beginning of our three hours of hands-on time with the game, it became apparent that this remake wasn't just a simple remaster. Many of the game's most iconic moments have been recreated to heighten the tension, and even give some of the supporting cast more time to shine.  \n\nMafia: Definitive Edition will release on September 25 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Along with our hands-on impressions with the game, go check out our interview with game director Haden Blackman about how they remade the original game. Be sure to check back with GameSpot next month for our full review of the game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k08QmqRPKEk", "date_published": "2020-08-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Nintendo Direct Mini - Partner Showcase August 2020", "description": "A surprise Nintendo Direct Mini just dropped, revealing some upcoming titles coming soon from Nintendo partners.\n\nFeaturing Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, Just Dance, and more.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7Y3ZHb3RI", "date_published": "2020-08-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Saving for the Next Gen Show", "description": "Gamespot and NNESAGA present: Saving for the Next Gen show!

This fourth DLC will be the final addition covered by the Borderlands 3 Season Pass.\n\nAnd in Xbox news, the new August 2020 Xbox One update lets you preview Series X's UI.

According to Economic News Daily, its slated for Q1 of 2021. The new Switch could have a better display and enhanced \"interactivity\" as these are the only details reported so far. \n\nPersia also goes over CD Projekt Red's recent confirmation on Twitter that Cyberpunk 2077 will offer free DLC after launch which follows the model used for The Witcher 3. CD Projekt Red has previously talked about the importance of diversity and inclusion within its games, and it looks like it even extends all the way to accessibility options like subtitles as you\u2019ll even be able to adjust the size and color of the subtitles on day one. Cyberpunk 2077 is coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC on November 19; PS5 and Series X versions are also in the works\n\nLastly, Persia shares some details on two game announcements from DC Fandome, Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. \n\nWB Montreal's  Gotham Knights lets you play as Robin, Nightwing, Batgirl, or Red Hood who all have their own distinct fighting styles. And since this title is not continuing the story of the Arkham Games, you\u2019re fighting in a Gotham where Batman is dead.  Gotham Knights is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X, and PC in 2021. \n\nRocksteady\u2019s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League will be set in the Arkhamverse after Arkham Knight. Suicide Squad will also be a co-op action game where you can play as Harley Quinn, Deadshot, King Shark, and Captain Boomerang to defeat Superman after he kills an innocent civilian. Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League is coming to PS5, Series X, and PC in 2022\n\nThis is your Save State for Monday, August 24th.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:21 - A New Switch Model Is Being Reported...Again\n01:10 - Cyberpunk 2077 Will Have Free DLC & Adjustable Subtitles \n02:13 - Gotham Knights & Suicide Squad Games Confirmed", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2XzAalaXr8", "date_published": "2020-08-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Outriders Broadcast: Technomancer Class Reveal, New Co-op Gameplay, And More", "description": "On Outriders Broadcast 3, we get the reveal of the fourth class, the Technomancer, as well as co-op gameplay showing off a brand new environment.

You'll make decisions that align with one of the character's personas as they fight for control, influencing some visual changes and the branching storyline as you progress.\n\nAs announced for Xbox Series X and PS5 earlier this year, a new game based on the works of JRR Tolkien is on the way: The Lord of the Rings: Gollum. While little has been shared about the game thus far, it has now reemerged with a new teaser trailer and gameplay details for the stealth-based title, which is coming to both next-gen consoles and PC in 2021.\n\nGollum isn't strong but instead crafty, which will give you some opportunities to take out enemies in an otherwise predominantly stealth-focused gameplay. Some enemies can be taken down with stealth attacks or lured into dangerous parts of the environment, some of which might feature familiar characters that can aid Gollum on his journey.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: Gollum is set to launch sometime in 2021 exclusively for next-generation consoles and PC. Gameplay will only be shown in 2021, according to developer Daedalic Entertainment.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SXM6hk3sY74", "date_published": "2020-08-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
