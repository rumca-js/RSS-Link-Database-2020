Sure, he’s also guilty of not always tracking his man, but who cares when he’s senselessly popping no-look passes about, setting up counter-attacks by controlling the ball WITH HIS BACK, and sending Gennaro Gattuso to the shops so many times that the Italian has now got enough Nectar points to fly himself off to a secluded island for a bit of rehab.

And if I’m in a Japanese restaurant and a fly is in the building, I have about nine seconds to get out,” he says, referring, of course, to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wAuzCjipF00">legendary Karate Kid scene</a> in which Daniel (Macchio) catches a fly with chopsticks.</p><p>It is hard to convey just how stratospherically famous Macchio, now 58, became when The Karate Kid – in which he played plucky lower middle-class teen Daniel LaRusso, crane-kicking the snotty rich kids – came out in 1984. Back in the 80s, a young person could become a huge star with just one movie and, to a large extent, those movies still define those actors: Tom Cruise had Risky Business, Matthew Broderick had Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, Michael J Fox had Back to the Future and Macchio had The Karate Kid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/25/karate-kid-ralph-macchio-im-at-peace-with-the-choices-i-made-cobra-kai">Continue reading...</a>

I have never found his body physically attractive, and he has never done it for me</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>I was intentionally celibate for seven years before I got married, and we waited until we were (just about) married before we had sex. So I had no idea it would be this bad. In 14 years I have had </strong><strong>one (maybe </strong><strong>two) orgasms with him. I used to fake it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>before I realised that wasn’t helping at all</strong><strong>. He is very satisfied with me and talks about it often, which </strong><strong>annoys me. I have tried </strong><strong>talking to him about it </strong><strong>over the years and have been met with everything from: “Nothing is wrong with me – if you just did it with me more often you would be fine,” to him trying what I </strong><strong>tell</strong><strong> him to do </strong><strong>once, then reverting back to “his way”, or </strong><strong>doing one thing I tell him every time </strong><strong>to the point where I don’t even like it any more. The thought of talking to him </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>feels like an ordeal, and I am tired. </strong><strong>I ran into an old boyfriend recently and just the thought of him ignited </strong><strong>feelings that I can’t shake. So now I am unsatisfied, sexually frustrated, angry and resentful … and honestly considering an affair. Please help!</strong></p><p>I’m not going to tell you not to have an affair – but you already know that it’s risky. You also know that you married someone to whom you are not physically attracted, so you must accept responsibility for that. Usually, if sexual attraction does not exist early in a marriage, it is unlikely to develop over time. No wonder the chance encounter reminded you what you are missing! You have not explained why you were “intentionally celibate for seven years”, but I suspect it holds important clues as to why you are in such a position. Explore your history, deep feelings and motivations – ideally with an experienced therapist – because it will help you to make sense of your life and find answers. You are not alone in facing impossible choices during a time of awakening. But only you can decide what is most important – and how to preserve it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/25/my-husband-and-i-have-never-been-sexually-compatible-would-it-be-wrong-to-have-an-affair">Continue reading...</a>

## Tenet review – supremely ambitious race against time makes for superb cinema

There’s been a brand-new Daniel Craig spectacular <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2019/dec/04/no-time-to-die-trailer-james-bond-daniel-craig-007">ready to go since Easter</a>, arguably just the thing to get punters’ actual bums back on actual seats.

Tenet is a gigantically confusing, gigantically entertaining and gigantically gigantic metaphysical action thriller in which a protagonist called The Protagonist battles cosmic incursions from the future while time flows backwards and forwards at the same time. There’s a 747 plane that crashes into a warehouse and then uncrashes back out of it, for reasons that are not immediately obvious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/25/tenet-review-christopher-nolan-head-scratchingly-ambitious">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s cheap to be rich, and expensive to be poor. As the Sussexes set out to become financially independent, they are reaping the benefits of the privilege premium</p><p>The richer you are, the more free stuff you seem to get. I’m not sure what the technical term for this phenomenon is. Capitalism, perhaps? Trickle-up economics? Whatever it is called, Harry and Meghan are prime examples of it in action: the Sussexes have reportedly received more than <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/08/22/book-reveals-gifts-received-harry-meghan-including-hotel-stays-luxury-jets-13162433/">£3.5m in gifts</a> since they got together.

Diptyque, the purveyor of posh candles, apparently gave the couple several <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/08/22/prince-harry-meghan-markle-got-millions-in-freebies-book-claims/">pricey diffusers</a> for their wedding – because St George’s Chapel can get a little musty.</p><p>I’m not here to give Harry and Meghan a hard time: I couldn’t care less how many complimentary candles the couple have managed to wangle. Far better to be known as the “prince of handouts” than the “handsy prince”, after all. Being cheap isn’t necessarily problematic; being friends with a sex offender most certainly is.

<p>Don Jr has been lecturing the RNC about Americans’ desire for ‘a perfect family’. Just don’t look at his own – or the Conways</p><p>As the Republican national convention got under way <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/24/trump-rnc-latest-speeches-coronavirus">last night</a>, the party that has formed a personality cult around the personality of Donald Trump was treated to a speech from Don Jr. Say what you like about the polls, Junior’s mere presence sounded a note of optimism. After all, nothing says “hope” like being asked to believe in a second Trump administration by a man whose beard can’t even make you believe in his jawline.</p><p>The show-fiend in me would have preferred a joint speech from Don Jr and his brother Eric – Uday and Schmuday, one friend calls them – but it seems the Trump family plan to spread their fabled orators across the week. Eric will be day-released from the attic tomorrow and gibber though something or other, his tamer cracking the whip warningly in the wings. Ivanka will reportedly introduce her father on Thursday and hope he doesn’t try to hump her leg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/25/trumps-republicans-family-don-rnc-americans-conway">Continue reading...</a>

In a jug, mix together 150ml of sunflower oil and 100ml of olive oil. Pour a few drops of the oil into the egg yolks and mustard and whisk for a few seconds, then add a few drops more of oil. Beating continuously, add the oil, little by little, until the mayonnaise has thickened. As it progresses, you can add the oil in a thin, but steady stream until it is used up. The mayonnaise should be thick and glossy. Tear 12 basil leaves into small pieces, stir them into the mayonnaise, then add a squeeze of lemon juice, stir and set aside in a cool place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/25/nigel-slater-recipe-fried-artichokes-and-basil-mayonnaise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Peter Bradshaw celebrates the career of the former milkman who brought a working-class edge to the role of James Bond before further unleashing a sense of menace in roles for Hitchcock and Lumet</p><p>It is the most famous self-introduction from any character in movie history. Three cool monosyllables, surname first, a little curtly, as befits a former naval commander. And then, as if in afterthought, the first name, followed by the surname again – for all the world as if we needed it narrowed down, and wouldn’t recognise one of the world’s most famous fictional brands. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/seanconnery">Sean Connery</a> carried it off with icily disdainful style, perhaps at the baccarat table, in full evening dress with a cigarette hanging from his lips.</p><p>The introduction was a kind of challenge, or seduction, invariably addressed to an enemy. And the subtly anglicised Edinburgh accent, which appeared to soften or muddy those monosyllables, encouraged legions of comics and pub bores to think that they, too, could do the voice. In the early 60s, Connery’s James Bond was about as dangerous and sexy as it got on screen – until directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Sidney Lumet came along, and saw how Connery’s on-screen menace could be taken to the next level.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/25/sean-connery-at-90-appreciation-peter-bradshaw-james-bond">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Olympics are the fairytale that predatory coaches dangle before starry-eyed kids to get them to do anything they ask. I know because it happened to me </p><p>My mother never got to see me swim fast. I had only started swimming competitively in September, my 13th birthday was in December and by March she was dead. My family life was turned upside down as my father’s drinking became more than just a couple scotches each night, which was the beginning of the disconnect between the two of us. He barely noticed as I progressed rapidly through the levels of the team, putting me in the same group with swimmers who had been in the pool since they were five or six years old. As early as my freshman year in high school, it was clear that I had the talent and work ethic to earn a scholarship to a major Division I university.</p><p>All I could think about was going to the Olympics. That’s the fairytale that coaches dangle before every starry-eyed kid that becomes a swimmer. A dream that coaches with bad intentions absolutely wield to their advantage, grooming them with the promise of becoming a big-time swimmer as they break you down and tease out performances you didn’t know you were capable of. The coaches use predatory behaviors to get kids to do anything they ask. I know because it happened to me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/25/my-swim-coach-raped-me-when-i-was-17-usa-swimming-made-it-disappear">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch; Metronomik<br /></strong>With genre music battles and stylish design, this game should be great – but it can’t decide whether it’s a third-person fighter or a rhythm-action game </p><p>Musical adventure No Straight Roads certainly got my foot tapping, albeit more due to frustration than the game’s admittedly catchy tunes. Set in the music-obsessed metropolis of Vinyl City, No Straight Roads sees you play as two wannabe rock stars fighting against the dictatorship of NSR records, which not only mediates the city’s music tastes, but also controls its power supply.</p><p>No Straight Roads has what it takes to be a pop sensation, namely a strong sense of style and a good ear. Vinyl City is a dazzling neon sprawl divided into multiple districts, from the kawaii-colours and anime billboards of Akusuka, to the leafy groves and neoclassical architecture of Natura. These districts are controlled by powerful pop stars you need to face in battle, with victory bringing you one step closer to NSR’s glittering skyscraper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/aug/25/no-straight-roads-review-musical-genre-battle">Continue reading...</a>

## The tyranny of chairs: why we need better design

<p>Most chairs aren’t designed to serve human bodies – but a better seat is possible. By Sara Hendren</p><p>‘Let’s face the considerable evidence that all sitting is harmful,” writes Galen Cranz, a design historian whose book The Chair traces this object’s long history. Not <em>all</em> sitting, of course. For people who use wheelchairs, they’re an elegant and crucial technology. And sitting itself is not the culprit; any unchanging, repetitive motion or posture fails to give the body the variation it needs. But Cranz, writing primarily for an audience of ambulatory readers in industrialised and therefore sedentary societies, is one of many researchers who have been saying for decades that chairs are a major cause of pain and disability.</p><p>Sitting for hours and hours can weaken your back and core muscles, pinch the nerves of your rear end and constrain the flow of blood that your body needs for peak energy and attention. Most people’s bodies are largely unsuited to extended periods in these structures. Extensive research confirms that sitting in chairs is correlated, Cranz notes, with “back pain of all sorts, fatigue, varicose veins, stress and problems with the diaphragm, circulation, digestion, elimination and general body development”. There is growing evidence that relentlessly sedentary jobs – in some, such as bus driving and forklift operating, bodies are literally strapped to chairs – are harmful enough to shorten life expectancy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/25/the-tyranny-of-chairs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>20-year-old Timesha Beauchamp was discovered alive shortly before she was to be embalmed, according to family lawyer. </p><p>A young woman who was declared dead at her suburban Detroit home opened her eyes at a funeral home as she was about to be embalmed, a lawyer has said.<br /><br />“They would have begun draining her blood to be very, very frank about it,” Geoffrey Fieger told WXYZ-TV. Fieger, who was hired by the family, identified the woman as Timesha Beauchamp.<br /><br />The Southfield fire department acknowledged it was involved in a bizarre set of events on Sunday that began when a medical crew was summoned to a home where a 20-year-old woman was unresponsive.<br /><br />Paramedics tried to revive her for 30 minutes and consulted an emergency room doctor, the department said.<br /><br />The doctor “pronounced the patient deceased based upon medical information provided” from the scene, the department said.<br /><br />The Oakland county medical examiner’s office said the body could be released to the family without an autopsy, according to the fire department.<br /><br />But then came a startling discovery at the James H Cole funeral home in Detroit: the woman was still alive more than an hour later.<br /><br />“Our staff confirmed she was breathing” and called a emergency medical crew, the funeral home said.<br /><br />Fieger said: “They were about to embalm her, which is most frightening, had she not had her eyes open ... The funeral home unzipping the body bag, literally that’s what happened to Timesha, and seeing her alive with her eyes open.”<br /><br />Fieger did not return a message from the Associated Press. <br /><br />Beauchamp was in a critical condition on Monday night, said Brian Taylor, spokesman for the Detroit Medical Centre.<br /><br />“My heart is so heavy. Someone pronounced my child dead, and she’s not even dead,” Beauchamp’s mother, Erica Lattimore, told WDIV-TV.<br /><br />Southfield said it was conducting an internal investigation but insisted that the fire and police departments had followed procedures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/25/dead-woman-discovered-alive-in-body-bag-at-funeral-home">Continue reading...</a>
