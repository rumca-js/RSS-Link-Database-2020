The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Aug. 26, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- It didn't take long for Billie Eilish to become one of the biggest pop stars in the world, sweep the Grammy Awards' major categories and release the latest James Bond theme. And today, at just 18, she and her brother, Finneas, have accomplished what no one has been able to do for five and a half months: perform a Tiny Desk concert in what certainly appears to be the NPR Music offices.

Of course, due to safety concerns, even the NPR Music staff can't set foot in the building that houses Bob Boilen's desk. But if you look over Eilish's shoulder, there's no mistaking the signs that she's appearing at the Tiny Desk in its present-day form: On the last day before staff began working from home, I took home the Green Bay Packers helmet that sat on the top shelf — the one Harry Styles had signed a few weeks earlier — for safe keeping. In this performance, that spot is empty.

So how the heck did they do it?

Honestly, it's best that you watch the whole video to experience the extent of the technical feat — which, in the spirit of Eilish's Saturday Night Live performance, they're willing to share with you. And thankfully, we still have our ways of photographing the desk, even if the room has fallen silent.

So settle in for a welcome jolt of Tiny Desk innovation, not to mention two of the excellent standalone singles Billie Eilish has released in the past year: "my future" and "everything i wanted." And, seriously, be sure to watch until the very end.

SET LIST
"my future"
"everything i wanted"

MUSICIANS
Billie Eilish: vocals, keys; Finneas: keys, guitar

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Aug. 25, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Yola is an electrifying performer. My first experience — in the dark, dingy basement of Grimey's at the 2016 AMERICANAFEST in Nashville — was stunning, soulful and frenetic. To see this British singer now — sitting in a grassy, sunlit backyard in Nashville with acoustic guitar accompaniment — was worthy of a double-take. But that's what makes these Tiny Desk (home) concerts so fascinating. We get reintroduced to the deeper sides of so many of the participating artists. In this case, Yola performs songs with guitarist Jordan Tice of Hawktail. They're beautiful interpretations of songs from her 2019 album Walk Through Fire and her 2016 EP Orphan Offering that pull back the intensity I associate with Yola's music, but are still passionate and fervent. This is a rare Yola moment in her temporary quarantine home, so put the whiskey aside, grab a glass of iced tea and chill.

SET LIST
"Faraway Look"
"Dead And Gone"
"Love Is Light"
"It Ain't Easier"

MUSICIANS
Yola: vocals, guitar; Jordan Tice: guitar, vocals
