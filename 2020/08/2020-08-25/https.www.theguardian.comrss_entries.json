Back in the 80s, a young person could become a huge star with just one movie and, to a large extent, those movies still define those actors: Tom Cruise had Risky Business, Matthew Broderick had Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off, Michael J Fox had Back to the Future and Macchio had The Karate Kid.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/25/karate-kid-ralph-macchio-im-at-peace-with-the-choices-i-made-cobra-kai\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/25/karate-kid-ralph-macchio-im-at-peace-with-the-choices-i-made-cobra-kai", "date_published": "2020-08-25 15:17:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Proms row: Johnson calls for end to 'cringing embarrassment' over UK history", "description": "<p>PM says Rule, Britannia! should be sung at Last Night of the Proms as he criticises \u2018self-recrimination and wetness\u2019</p><p>Boris Johnson has said the UK should stop \u201cour cringing embarrassment about our history\u201d and sing Rule, Britannia! at the Last Night of the Proms, as BBC insiders fear the broadcaster is being dragged into a divisive culture war issue designed to undermine it.</p><p>\u201cIf it is correct, which I cannot believe that it really is, but if it is correct, that the BBC is saying that they will not sing the words of Land Of Hope And Glory or Rule, Britannia! as they traditionally do at the end of The Last Night of The Proms,\u201d said the prime minister, \u201cI think it\u2019s time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general fight of self-recrimination and wetness.

A chance meeting with an ex-boyfriend has awakened feelings I had almost forgotten</p><p><strong>I love sex, </strong><strong>but for 15 years my husband and I have been</strong><strong> sexually incompatible. We have a good working relationship</strong><strong> with three kids, we support each other and have plenty of friends,</strong><strong> but sexually it is dismal. I have never found his body physically attractive, and he has never done it for me</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>I was intentionally celibate for seven years before I got married, and we waited until we were (just about) married before we had sex. So I had no idea it would be this bad. In 14 years I have had </strong><strong>one (maybe </strong><strong>two) orgasms with him. I used to fake it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>before I realised that wasn\u2019t helping at all</strong><strong>. He is very satisfied with me and talks about it often, which </strong><strong>annoys me. I have tried </strong><strong>talking to him about it </strong><strong>over the years and have been met with everything from: \u201cNothing is wrong with me \u2013 if you just did it with me more often you would be fine,\u201d to him trying what I </strong><strong>tell</strong><strong> him to do </strong><strong>once, then reverting back to \u201chis way\u201d, or </strong><strong>doing one thing I tell him every time </strong><strong>to the point where I don\u2019t even like it any more. The thought of talking to him </strong><strong>just </strong><strong>feels like an ordeal, and I am tired. </strong><strong>I ran into an old boyfriend recently and just the thought of him ignited </strong><strong>feelings that I can\u2019t shake. So now I am unsatisfied, sexually frustrated, angry and resentful \u2026 and honestly considering an affair. Please help!</strong></p><p>I\u2019m not going to tell you not to have an affair \u2013 but you already know that it\u2019s risky. You also know that you married someone to whom you are not physically attracted, so you must accept responsibility for that. Usually, if sexual attraction does not exist early in a marriage, it is unlikely to develop over time. No wonder the chance encounter reminded you what you are missing! You have not explained why you were \u201cintentionally celibate for seven years\u201d, but I suspect it holds important clues as to why you are in such a position. Explore your history, deep feelings and motivations \u2013 ideally with an experienced therapist \u2013 because it will help you to make sense of your life and find answers. You are not alone in facing impossible choices during a time of awakening. But only you can decide what is most important \u2013 and how to preserve it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/25/my-husband-and-i-have-never-been-sexually-compatible-would-it-be-wrong-to-have-an-affair\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/25/my-husband-and-i-have-never-been-sexually-compatible-would-it-be-wrong-to-have-an-affair", "date_published": "2020-08-25 13:18:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Southampton say 'no alternative' but to ditch shirt sponsor LD Sports", "description": "<ul><li>Chinese brand to be replaced by Sportsbet.io for next season</li><li>Club will work with fans who have already bought 2020-21 shirts<br /></li></ul><p>Southampton have announced an abrupt end to their sponsorship arrangement with LD Sports, suggesting that the Chinese brand is no longer an appropriate and viable partner.

Not <em>all</em> sitting, of course. For people who use wheelchairs, they\u2019re an elegant and crucial technology. And sitting itself is not the culprit; any unchanging, repetitive motion or posture fails to give the body the variation it needs. But Cranz, writing primarily for an audience of ambulatory readers in industrialised and therefore sedentary societies, is one of many researchers who have been saying for decades that chairs are a major cause of pain and disability.</p><p>Sitting for hours and hours can weaken your back and core muscles, pinch the nerves of your rear end and constrain the flow of blood that your body needs for peak energy and attention. Most people\u2019s bodies are largely unsuited to extended periods in these structures. Extensive research confirms that sitting in chairs is correlated, Cranz notes, with \u201cback pain of all sorts, fatigue, varicose veins, stress and problems with the diaphragm, circulation, digestion, elimination and general body development\u201d. There is growing evidence that relentlessly sedentary jobs \u2013 in some, such as bus driving and forklift operating, bodies are literally strapped to chairs \u2013 are harmful enough to shorten life expectancy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/25/the-tyranny-of-chairs\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/25/the-tyranny-of-chairs", "date_published": "2020-08-25 05:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018I feel she was abandoned\u2019: The life and terrible death of Belly Mujinga", "description": "<p>A devoted mother and transport worker, Mujinga was confronted by an angry passenger as Covid-19 swept the UK in March.
