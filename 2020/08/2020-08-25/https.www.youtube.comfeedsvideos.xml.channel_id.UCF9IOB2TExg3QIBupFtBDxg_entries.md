Full version with evidence to follow. This is important as it explains why we have a pandemic in the first place and how transmission will play out over the next months. While deaths rates are thankfully low in many areas now, there is a real risk they will rise steeply with the onset of colder weather.

I think the CDC have changed their testing guidelines in order to prevent the virus being spread by people with a negative test result. This is because people who test negative could go on to test positive in the next few days. This is important as people are most infectious in the day or two immediately before and after the onset of symptoms.
Proportion of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta‐analysis (Journal of Medical Virology, 21 July)

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26326

Meta Analysis

N = 50, 155 

41 studies

Asymptomatic, confirmed COVID‐19

Overall pooled data

15.6% are asymptomatic

84.4 are symptomatic

Asymptomatics in children

N = 1, 152

11 studies

27.7% asymptomatic

72.3 symptomatic

Nearly half of the patients with no symptoms at detection time will develop symptoms later

48.9% of asymptomatic go on to become symptomatic

Asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients could have abnormal laboratory and radiational manifestations

Which can be used as screening strategies to identify asymptomatic infection.

CT results in asymptomatics

N = 36

4 studies

63% had an abnormal CT

Reduced white blood cell count, 27%

Increases lymphocyte count

Increased lactate dehydrogenase, 42.3%

Increased C‐reactive protein, 11.5%

Clinical Course and Molecular Viral Shedding Among Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Community Treatment Center in the Republic of Korea

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769235

Aim

To quantitatively describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular viral shedding in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients

Method

Cohort study

n =  303

Isolated in a community treatment center in Korea

Results

110 (36.3%) were asymptomatic at the time of isolation

21 of these (19.1%) developed symptoms during isolation

Time from detection of SARS-CoV-2 to symptom onset in presymptomatic patients was 15 (13-20) days

Time from diagnosis to the first negative conversion

Asymptomatic, 17 days

Symptomatic, 19.5 days

Viral loads, same

Meaning 

Many individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic for a prolonged period

Viral load was similar to that in symptomatic patients

Isolation of infected persons should be performed regardless of symptoms

Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19 (Nature medicine, 17th August)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5

94 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19

Estimated that 44% of secondary cases were infected during the index cases’ presymptomatic stage

Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission.

The implications of silent transmission for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks (PNAS – US, 28th July)

https://www.pnas.org/content/117/30/17513

If 17.9% of infections are asymptomatic

Presymptomatic transmission, 48% of transmission

Asymptomatic transmission, 3.4% of transmission

Even immediate isolation of all symptomatic cases is insufficient to achieve control 

Urgent need to scale up testing of suspected cases

Supplemented by rapid contact-based surveillance to identify exposed individuals 
prior to their infectious period

Overview of Testing for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html

Considerations for COVID-19 Diagnostic (Molecular or Antigen) Testing

Mild symptoms of COVID-19

Your health care provider may advise a test.

If you test positive or do not get tested, self-isolate for at least 10 days after symptom onset

And at least 24 hours after the resolution of any fever (without the use of fever-reducing medications)

If you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms

You do not necessarily need a test, unless in a vulnerable group

Or

Health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one

A negative test does not mean you will not develop an infection from the close contact or contract an infection at a later time

You should monitor yourself for symptoms

If you do not have COVID-19 symptoms and have not been in close contact with someone known to have a COVID-19 infection:

You do not need a test.

If you are in a high COVID-19 transmission area and have attended a public or private gathering of more than 10 people (without widespread mask wearing or physical distancing)

You do not necessarily need a test

Live or work in a care facility

You will need to be tested

Critical infrastructure worker, health care worker, or first responder

You may need to get a test, according to your employer’s guidelines.

Not prolonged viral shedding

33-year-old man, good health

Immunocompetent

First infection

3 days, cough, sore throat, fever, headache

Hospitalized

Serum at day 10, negative for IgG

26th March

Oropharyngeal antigen PCR diagnosis

14th April

Discharged asymptomatic

142 days

2nd infection

Spain - UK – HK

15th August

Oropharyngeal positive at HK airport

Hospitalised, remained asymptomatic

T, 36.5 

HR, 86

BP, 133/94

SaO2, 98 RA

CRP, 8.6 mg / L

Slightly raised, suggesting acute infection

Declining during hospitalisation

Hypokalaemia

Viral load progressively decreased

Serum day 5 of hospitalisation, positive

Genome analysis

Full sequencing performed after first and second episode

Different clade/lineage

Truncation of 58 amino acids in the virus genome

23 nucleotide changes

13 of which non-synonymous mutations

4 in the spike protein

First strain

Mostly close to strains from USA or England collected in March and April

Second strain

Switzerland and England collected in July and August

Evidence

Genomics, phylogenetic analysis

142 days, viral shedding (104 days in one pregnant woman)

Raised CPR indicating acute infection

Patient had recently returned from Europe with July and August strains

Implications

Unlikely herd immunity can eliminate SARS-CoV-2

Subsequent infections likely to be milder

Virus likely to go on circulating in the human population

Vaccine will not provide lifelong infection

Vaccine studies should include patients who have recovered from COVID

People who have had COVID should be vaccinated

People who have had COVID should continue with public health measures

Residual low level of antibodies may have controlled the second infection

Dr Maria Van Kerkhove

I haven't read the study

Our expectations, people who are infected with this virus develop an immune response 

People do develop an immune response, not completely clear yet is how strong and how long lasting

Severe, mild, asymptomatic cases, develop an immune response

More than 24 million cases

On a population level

Longitudinal studies, following the same individual underway

Thank you, Andrew, for having the courage to share your experiences and difficulties with us. Many people with be able to relate to your experience and will greatly benefit from knowing they are not alone.

Andrew had an antigen test in late April (swab test - negative). This was the first possible opportunity he had to be tested - nothing else was available before then.
