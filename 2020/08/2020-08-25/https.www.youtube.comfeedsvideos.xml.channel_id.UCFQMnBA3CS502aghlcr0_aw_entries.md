Go follow the webtoon!
https://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/the-internet-guru-chronicles-/cover-art-ep-0-prologue/viewer?title_no=486666&episode_no=2

I may be biased but I think this is the greatest WEBTOON of all the WEBTOONS. 
Looking forward to where this series goes from here.

Outro music is Pay for that money - the Defibulators

BTW: The thumbnail was clearly inspired by DAN LOK and the Cult of Dan Lok video
