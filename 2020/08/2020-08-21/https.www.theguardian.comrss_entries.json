Here she combines her two skills, drawing on some of her favourite fictional themes (the complexities of storytelling, multiple identities, women\u2019s voices) to dissect the anger and anxieties of contemporary society, and the disappointments so neatly symbolised by the names of little Facebook and Like.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/how-to-stay-sane-in-an-age-of-division-by-elif-shafak-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/how-to-stay-sane-in-an-age-of-division-by-elif-shafak-review", "date_published": "2020-08-21 06:30:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Palestinians stage surprise 'thank you' event for Banksy in Bethlehem", "description": "<p>Photographs of works go on display in Manger Square to celebrate British street artist\u2019s contribution to diversifying tourism</p><p>Photographs of 20 pieces of Banksy\u2019s artwork in Palestine have been displayed in the centre of Bethlehem as a thank you to the anonymous British street artist for helping diversify tourism in the city.</p><p>The images were collated by Palestinian photographers for the surprise exhibition in Manger Square.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/21/palestinians-stage-surprise-thank-you-event-for-banksy-in-bethlehem\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/aug/21/palestinians-stage-surprise-thank-you-event-for-banksy-in-bethlehem", "date_published": "2020-08-21 06:19:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "I like pools, and have named ducks in swimming ponds.
