<p>The Bath winger insists he is fitter than he has ever been and is determined to rediscover the best of himself on the field</p><p>The rise of Ruaridh McConnochie has been among English rugby’s most heartwarming stories.

To say the latter feels sympathy for all those currently stuck in limbo is an understatement. “I’m absolutely gutted. It’s horrible what’s gone on … guys have families, mortgages and live in south-west London which isn’t the cheapest place to live. To be told like [they were] has put them in a tough spot.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/21/ruaridh-mcconnochie-i-just-want-to-get-back-into-england-contention-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You’ll have heard that Boris Johnson is on vacation. The most nuanced rejoinder is: lol, a vacation from what?</p><p>Enormous thanks to the Daily Mail for tracking down Boris Johnson to a clifftop Scottish cottage, with some naff sort of yurt clinging on gamely in the garden. I thought it must be the chilliest place the prime minister had ever secluded himself, until I remembered he hid in a fridge during the general election.</p><p>Still, you’ll have been aware for some time now that Johnson is on holiday. The most nuanced rejoinder this deserves is: lol, a holiday from what? He really is the Tamara Ecclestone of government. Like me, you probably thrive on keeping up with Bernie Ecclestone’s kajillionaire daughter, as she makes her stately and seemingly unceasing progress from not being at work here to not being at work there. “I see Dubai got too much eventually,” I find myself remarking to the latest set of pictures. She’s had to go to Croatia to recover. I suppose the difference between Tamara and the prime minister is that he is running a slightly larger concern. She once had a chain of blow-dry bars, but they’ve shut down now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/21/yurt-holiday-pm-british-exams-meltdown-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government seems to have given the green light to a long mistrusted genre – but it’s unclear what territory the new breed of blockbusters will explore</p><p>You might think a nation that effectively banned science fiction for much of its history (during the Cultural Revolution, and for other periods) might hesitate before encouraging its film-makers to get their futuristic thinking caps on. But China’s communist government has apparently been inspired by the huge box office success of homegrown space blockbuster The Wandering Earth to issue guidelines aimed at emboldening directors and screenwriters who might be planning a follow-up.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/china-guidelines-science-fiction-1234737913/">Variety reports</a> the official document “highlights how the sci-fi genre fits into the ruling Communist party’s broader ideological and technological goals”, which sounds suitably 1984. (Except that George Orwell’s seminal dystopian tome is frowned upon in China, to the extent that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/01/why-1984-and-animal-farm-arent-banned-china/580156/">authorities at once point last year stopped social media users from being able to type out its title in reference to an abolition of presidential term limits</a>; strangely enough, the book itself is not banned.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/21/to-ideology-and-beyond-will-chinas-new-sci-fi-directors-plot-their-own-course">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This Booker-longlisted snapshot of the life of a queer black postgraduate forcefully tackles the effects of racism and abuse</p><p>Wallace, the queer black biochemistry postgraduate at the centre of US author Brandon Taylor’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/28/booker-prize-2020-longlist-announced-hilary-mantel"> Booker-longlisted debut</a>, often seeks out solitude. On the Friday evening on which <em>Real Life</em> begins, Wallace abandons his carousing colleagues and the bars of their midwestern university for the tranquility of a local lake. He dangles his feet in the ripples. He enjoys the bracing freshness. In this formally and conceptually testing book, however, such moments of repose are never without threat. Wallace soon reflects that “there was something slick in the water, something apart from the water itself, like a loose second skin swilling under the surface”.</p><p>With its icily cool sentences, mysterious tonal shifts and determinedly open ending, Taylor’s novel is also a curiously liquid thing, with troubling, opaque depths. Set over a late summer weekend, the novel is a snapshot of Wallace’s life in the aftermath of his father’s recent death. Early on in the narrative, Wallace’s friends discover that his father passed away a few weeks ago. Wallace told no one about this, nor did he attend his father’s funeral.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/real-life-by-brandon-taylor-review-violent-legacy-of-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The DJ-producer spent lockdown secretly remixing Dua Lipa in her pyjamas – and facing up to the discomfort she caused with her former name, the Black Madonna<br /></p><p>When I meet the Blessed Madonna at her home, she has been having a spectacular morning. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3tCHMagPOY">Her remix of Dua Lipa’s Levitating</a>, featuring Madonna and Missy Elliott, dropped the previous night, sparking hysteria from fans of all three stars. At 7am, she was half asleep, “spilling her emotions out” to Kanye West’s producer Mike Dean, who worked on the song. By the time she was up and about, it was higher in the UK iTunes chart than Drake’s new single.</p><p>For the past few months, the American DJ, producer and label owner – real name Marea Stamper – has been secretly curating a Dua Lipa remix album, which will be released next Friday as Club Future Nostalgia, from a festival-worthy lineup of dance artists including Mark Ronson, Moodymann, Paul Woolford, Midland, Jayda G and Masters at Work. She says “99.9% of lockdown” has been spent working on it in her pyjamas in a top-floor studio at her terraced house in east London, with a laptop, some monitor speakers and her dog. Occasionally, she would receive food and water deliveries from her husband. All in all, it has been “weird. You do this thing you feel so passionate about and you can’t tell anyone.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/21/the-blessed-madonna-changing-my-name-was-a-very-catholic-experience">Continue reading...</a>

## How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division by Elif Shafak review – a poignant look back at another age

<p>What has happened to the belief that social media can create a new and better world?</p><p>Two of the most intriguing walk-on characters in Elif Shafak’s <em>How to Stay Sane</em> are the little Egyptian girl named “Facebook” by her parents in that brief, optimistic phase of the Arab spring – and another baby given the name “Like” in Israel just a few months later. They are poignant reminders of another age in which social media looked set to deliver a new and better world. It is hard not to wonder, as Shafak does, what has become of this pair. “Do they view the buoyancy that presided when they were born as a relic of the past … ?” Or to put it more simply, “what on earth have they done with their names?” Discarded them at the earliest opportunity would be my guess – whether because of the misplaced optimism with which their parents had branded them, or simple embarrassment in the playground.</p><p><em>How to Stay Sane in an Age of Division</em> is a sharp and elegant pamphlet of just 90 pages. Though better known as a novelist (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jun/16/10-minutes-38-seconds-in-this-strange-world-by-elif-shafak-book-review">10 Minutes 38 Seconds in This Strange World</a></em> was shortlisted for the Booker last year), Shafak is a political theorist by academic training. Here she combines her two skills, drawing on some of her favourite fictional themes (the complexities of storytelling, multiple identities, women’s voices) to dissect the anger and anxieties of contemporary society, and the disappointments so neatly symbolised by the names of little Facebook and Like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/21/how-to-stay-sane-in-an-age-of-division-by-elif-shafak-review">Continue reading...</a>

I want the deep navy with the surface wobble of jelly; or the entirely transparent water that laps at the shore, transforming my normal-sized feet into milky giants.</p><p>Give me all of the seas and let me swim in them.

<p>However uncertain the road ahead, these protests show how authoritarianism ultimately subverts itself</p><p>Of all the moving scenes from Belarus, one sticks in my mind. A man, probably in his 30s, holds his child on his arm. “The election was … ” he says to the camera, pauses nervously for a long moment, glances sideways at his child, and then concludes explosively, “<em>falsified!”</em> There you have the exact moment, crucial for any protest movement against any dictatorship, when the individual breaks through the barrier of fear. Yesterday, he would not have dared to complete that sentence in public. Today, he will find himself among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/belarus-prepares-for-biggest-protest-yet-after-week-of-anger">tens of thousands who are shouting the same thing</a> at the top of their voices, waving the red and white flag that stands for a better Belarus. Speak out for the future of the child on your arm.</p><p>Events in Belarus now join a long line of anti-Soviet and anti-post-Soviet protest movements – some of which succeeded, some of which failed. “Colour revolutions” is a flimsy, politically compromised term that offers much too short a perspective. Since Belarus is the most Soviet of all the post-Soviet states, you can reach back even as far as the East German protests in 1953. When you see workers in large state factories confronting Alexander Lukashenko face to face, and reportedly forming an inter-factory strike committee, you are in Poland in 1980. Or perhaps it’s more like Armenia in 2018? Or Ukraine in 2014? Or – the unavoidable reference – the central European revolutions of 1989? And don’t forget that Belarusians themselves have tried several times before. This is not the first election Lukashenko has falsified.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/21/belarus-freedom-protests">Continue reading...</a>
