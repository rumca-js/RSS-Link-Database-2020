I'm honored to be one of GitHub's first 'Stars', and they sent me a box of swagâ€”some of it to be shared with you! Leave a comment below if you want me to send you something. I'll pick a few people and send an envelope with some stickers (at least!).

And if you sponsor my work on Patreon or GitHub Sponsors, send me your address and I'll try to get some stickers to you!
