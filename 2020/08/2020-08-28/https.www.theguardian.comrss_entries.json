Twin brothers Tim and Fred Williams, who post YouTube vids under the name <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCopm4iCRGWS6PkLB8uDe-Wg\">Twinsisthenewtrend</a>, shared a clip that went viral. In it, the affably enthusiastic 21-year-olds sit down to listen to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/13/phil-collins-greatest-solo-songs-ranked\">Phil Collins</a>\u2019s moody, 1981 reverb anthem In the Air Tonight. And, well, that\u2019s it. The clip is just them, doing that. But their reactions made it one of the most talked-about videos of the year, clocking up over six million views in three weeks. Because there\u2019s a twist: the twins had never heard this song before. Their minds are suitably, and adorably, blown.</p><p>\u201cI ain\u2019t never seen nobody drop a beat three minutes in a song!\u201d they hoot, delighted, after Phil clatters in with that drum fill \u2013 the one we\u2019ve been so familiar with for so long that it\u2019s passed into the graveyard of hoary old cliche. But hearing it through fresh ears \u2013 their ears \u2013 and watching the twins as they\u2019re floored for the first time reminded people what an amazing musical moment it is. As a direct result of the clip, the song shot to No 2 in the US iTunes charts.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/28/do-you-remember-the-first-time-the-joys-of-youtube-reaction-videos-phil-collins-in-the-air-tonight\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/28/do-you-remember-the-first-time-the-joys-of-youtube-reaction-videos-phil-collins-in-the-air-tonight", "date_published": "2020-08-28 12:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dylan Hartley: 'Rugby normalises pain and injuries \u2013 it\u2019s the reality'", "description": "<p>The former England captain talks to Don McRae about retirement, life in the international spotlight and the brutal demands of the modern game</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/dylan-hartley\">Dylan Hartley</a> picks his way through the brightly coloured balloons that light up his house on a rainy morning in the Northamptonshire countryside.

Almost. I slept better, occasionally waking up not feeling too anxious, and my wife even reported hearing me laugh for the first time in months. Though I have no memory of that. We didn\u2019t actually do that much other than sit on the beach when it was sunny and go for walks when it was wet or cloudy \u2013 and sometimes vice-versa \u2013 and a seal even poked its head up just yards from where we were swimming. Or in my case bobbing. In the evenings, we ate, played cards and talked the ideal mixture of sense and nonsense. Now that we\u2019re back, though, I feel the dread returning. The nights are closing in, the weather has become more autumnal and I fear we are in for a long winter of further lockdowns and high unemployment. Most of all, though, I miss my children. Even if my daughter, Anna, does make it over here from Minneapolis for Christmas \u2013 and we aren\u2019t banking on that being possible \u2013 it will have been a year since I last saw her. My son we have seen just three times this year, partly because of lockdown but also because he is busy and now has a life of his own. While I feel proud that they have grown up to be independent of us \u2013 it\u2019s what I always wanted for them and I\u2019m confident that if they were still living at home we\u2019d be getting on each others\u2019 nerves big time \u2013 I still experience it as a loss. Last week, we went down to Brighton for a couple of days to see Robbie and his girlfriend and I spent most of the drive home in tears. In some ways, seeing the children has become as painful as not seeing them.
