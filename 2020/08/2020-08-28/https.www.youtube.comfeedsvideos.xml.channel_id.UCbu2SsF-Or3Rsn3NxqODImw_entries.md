This week's Generation Next overlaps with Gamescom, so Tamoor, Lucy, and Jordan discuss the biggest news from the show, as well as compare 2020's event to Gamescom 2013, the one just before PS4 and Xbox One launched.

Just like every other major gaming event this year, Gamescom adapted its show to fit the current state of the world. Instead of filling the halls of Koelnmesse with far too many people, Geoff Keighley delivered Opening Night Live, a liveshow that showcased trailers, made announcements, and provided in-depth looks at upcoming games.

On this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor sit down to discuss the major beats of the show. More importantly, they compare 2020's Gamescom with 2013's, which occurred shortly before the PS4 and Xbox One launched. They compare and contrast how Sony and Microsoft's approached messaging around the launch of new generation hardware in both years.

And because you asked, GameSpot's techspert Michael Higham also joins the show to offer some insight into how to buy a new TV or monitor for PS5 and Xbox Series X, so if you're in the market for an upgrade, you'll get some information on what to look out for before handing over your hard-earned money.

Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.

The new Observer: System Redux is so much more than a visual upgrade. It brings a wide range of quality-of-life improvements, gameplay enhancements, and three new missions featuring brand-new storylines. 

“Errant Signal”, “Her Fearful Symmetry” and “It Runs in the Family” add another layer of depth to the game’s story while exploring thought-provoking themes of a future that soon might become our present.

On top of that, System Redux offers expanded gameplay, which includes new game mechanics, new secrets to find, redesigned stealth, additional neural interrogations, and quality-of-life improvements made with the help of the Observer community.

Considered one of the scariest games currently available, and one the best cyberpunk games coming to next-generation consoles, System Redux is the definitive vision of this thriller tale.

Experience first-hand what Observer: System Redux really is. Go to Steam, download the free demo and join Daniel Lazarski in his investigation. https://bit.ly/ObserverSR
