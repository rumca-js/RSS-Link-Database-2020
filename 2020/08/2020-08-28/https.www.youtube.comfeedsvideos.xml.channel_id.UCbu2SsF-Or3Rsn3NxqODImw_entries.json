More importantly, they compare 2020's Gamescom with 2013's, which occurred shortly before the PS4 and Xbox One launched. They compare and contrast how Sony and Microsoft's approached messaging around the launch of new generation hardware in both years.\n\nAnd because you asked, GameSpot's techspert Michael Higham also joins the show to offer some insight into how to buy a new TV or monitor for PS5 and Xbox Series X, so if you're in the market for an upgrade, you'll get some information on what to look out for before handing over your hard-earned money.\n\nGeneration Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
