They make a pretty bizarre team: they were all conceptual innovators, but they innovated in different directions, and ended up with hardly anything in common apart from the fact that their mother tongue was German. If they had all ever met over <em>Kaffee</em> <em>und Kuchen</em> \u2013 which they certainly did not \u2013 they would probably have disagreed about everything. According to Eilenberger, however, they were united by the \u201cspirit of the age\u201d, which led them to \u201cbreak away from the old frameworks (family, religion, nation, capitalism)\u201d, and construct a new model of existence commensurate with \u201cthe experience of war\u201d. They struck lucky, it would seem, and Eilenberger hails them as the \u201cmagicians\u201d who made the 1920s into \u201cphilosophy\u2019s great decade\u201d.</p><p>Regardless of what may have happened in their lifetimes, Eilenberger\u2019s magicians have since drifted far apart. Wittgenstein and Heidegger are now world-famous as patrons of two philosophical tribes \u2013 the sober linguistic analysts and the wild deconstructive existentialists \u2013 who are barely on speaking terms; Benjamin, the mystical Marxist, has a following but a cultish one; and as for poor old Cassirer, he seems to have no followers at all.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/13/time-of-the-magicians-by-wolfram-eilenberger-review-philosophys-great-decade\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/13/time-of-the-magicians-by-wolfram-eilenberger-review-philosophys-great-decade", "date_published": "2020-08-13 06:30:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'Peace where rights aren\u2019t trampled': Afghan women's demands ahead of Taliban talks", "description": "<p>With negotiations set to begin, women have been sharing their \u2018red lines\u2019 on the progress they refuse to see negotiated</p><p>Farahnaz Forotan was three when the Taliban had arrived in Kabul.
