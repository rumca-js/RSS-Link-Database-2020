Elecrow sent me a CrowPi2 to review in this unboxing video; I originally planned on a full review by now, but my recent hospitalizations have delayed my plans quite a bit, so subscribe so you don't miss my full review later!

You can buy the CrowPi2 on Amazon:

  - Basic Kit (no Pi included): https://amzn.to/3Aa2UIC
  - Advanced Kit (Pi 4 + accessories): https://amzn.to/3dilB3h
  - Deluxe Kit (w/ extra sensors): https://amzn.to/3qyoIJy

Also, sorry about the audio qualityâ€”I never hit the 'record' button on my Lavaliere mic recorder... so you're hearing the cheap mic on my camcorder instead :)
