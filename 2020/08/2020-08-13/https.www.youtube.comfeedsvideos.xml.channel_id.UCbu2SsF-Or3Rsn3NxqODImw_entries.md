In today's gaming news, Fortnite developer Epic Games is suing Apple after Fortnite was removed from the App Store. Apple claims Epic violated App Store guidelines after introducing a new way to buy cheaper V-bucks, directly bypassing the App Store fee. 

The director of Spider-Man: Miles Morales has clarified that the game is going to be a complete standalone story when it launches later this year for PlayStation 5. 

And finally, Rockstar has rolled back their latest Red Dead Online update after it caused game-breaking bugs. While you're here, check out GameSpot's merch store.  Until the end of August, all the proceeds will go to charity, split between Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 direct relief.

Check out our side-by-side comparison of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater's Warehouse, 1999 versus 2020.

It's been 21 years since the release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and now the game is returning to modern consoles with the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake. The first game received a demo ahead of release featuring the iconic opening Warehouse level, and now history has repeated itself, with the newly upgraded Warehouse being made available to customers who digitally pre-ordered the remake or scored a code from Chipotle.

As you'll see in the video above, the map has received a full visual upgrade, while still staying largely the same as you'll remember it, with the same ramps, gaps, and rails you could skate back in 1999. It was a great level design back then, and it remains great now.

While the game will features an updated trick-list that lets you pull off moves from the sequels, including reverts, spine transfers, and fancy flatland tricks, in the video above we're playing with an in-game controller mod called "Classic THPS1". This disables any moves added from THPS2 onwards, including the manual, and makes for an authentic recreation of the first game. Other mods are included in the demo, letting you turn off bails, enable perfect balance for grinds, manuals, and lip tricks, or have your Special meter constantly full.

The demo is a blast of nostalgia, and has us more excited to revisit the Birdman's video game origins again. If you've pre-ordered, you'll be able to play the demo yourself from 8 AM PT on August 14.

In this video, Persia talks about some recent job listings from Cloud Chambers, the develolper behind Bioshock 4. One of the listings indicates that the setting of Bioshock 4 will be a new world instead of returning to Rapture or Columbia. Other listings also confirmed obvious details like being slated for next-gen and running on Unreal Engine 4.

Persia also goes over Control's new Ultimate Edition: an all-inclusive package of the game that will include a free upgrade to next-gen. As of right now, this new edition will be the only way to upgrade to next-gen for free, making current game and season pass holders not eligible.

And finally, after talks of game price increases for next-gen, Capcom is undecided on whether its prices will change. Capcom said that it will "consider our approach, having analyzed both our strengths and weaknesses while closely monitoring industry trends." Capcom also noted that first quarter revenue has exceeded its expectations, mostly due to strong digital sales.

Don't forget to check out store.gamespot.com to get some awesome Play For All merch. All proceeds will be donated to Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 relief efforts. 

This is your Save State for Wednesday, August 12th.

## Cyberpunk 2077 - Which Life Path Is Right For You?

The world of Cyberpunk 2077 reacts based on your choices. The first of these is one of the most important, as it determines where your character starts, and how the world will react to them: their life path. In preparation for Cyberpunk's November release, we're going to dive into all three choices so you can be prepared to build your perfect V.

You'll have three options to choose from for your life path: street kid, nomad, and corporate. The one you select will impact how you move through Night City, as you'll encounter different characters, story beats, and conversations depending on your origin. In this video, Jake breaks down each life path, and explains how they impact V's life leading up to the start of the RPG. 

Life paths follow you into the main quest and beyond as well. CD Projekt Red has said that each origin will determine which characters you meet and your relationships with them, and though some will appear across life paths, their disposition towards you will differ. Jackie Wells, your in-game companion, is an acquaintance regardless of which you choose, but your relationship will vary as each origin gives the two of you a different history. 

So which path are you taking to Night City?
