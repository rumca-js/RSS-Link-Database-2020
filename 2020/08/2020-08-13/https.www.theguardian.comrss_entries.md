## This weekend has to be day one of rugby's fight against racism | Ugo Monye

<p>The Rugby Against Racism campaign was belatedly born this week, 25 years after the game turned professional and thanks in the main to the raised awareness brought by the Black Lives Matter movement</p><p>Black lives matter. Those three words – a statement distilled to its purest form – are the best explanation I can give as to why I will take a knee when rugby restarts on Friday night. I am totally aware that the statement has been politicised and I strongly disagree with some of the things the organisation stands for, but there is one reason why pretty much every household has developed a greater understanding and awareness of anti-racism recently: the Black Lives Matter movement.</p><p>I also want to clear something up when it comes to taking a knee. There is the obvious association with the political organisation – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/premiership-rugby-union-will-restart-with-three-teams-taking-a-knee">which has </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/12/premiership-rugby-union-will-restart-with-three-teams-taking-a-knee">seen some Premiership players reluctant to do it this weekend</a> – and there is the fact that it was popularised by Colin Kaepernick, who has become such a global figure. But as I understand it, the origin of taking a knee was when Martin Luther King did so in 1965 during the civil rights movement. He did so as a peaceful protest and as a moment to say a prayer. I want to acknowledge and honour people like that who have done so much for people like me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/13/this-weekend-has-to-be-day-one-of-rugby-unions-fight-against-racism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The batsman’s comeback fell flat but hope springs eternal as Fawad hit a century in the second innings of his debut in 2009</p><p>They say the best things in life are worth waiting for. Fawad Alam’s innings in the second Test probably wasn’t one of them – unless, that is, you happen to have a particularly black sense of humour. Poor Fawad won the last of his Test caps in November 2009. Ten years, eight months, 17 days and 8,348 first-class runs later he was finally back, walking out to the middle at the Rose Bowl with his team 117 for four, Stuart Broad bowling at one end, Chris Woakes the other. He blocked one ball, left the next, played and missed the third, and then he was dismissed, lbw, by the fourth.</p><p>The umpire, Richard Kettleborough, gave him not out, so he nearly survived it. Back at the beginning of his Test career, he really would have done, since he made his debut before the decision review system was being used. It was officially brought in (after a couple of trials) for the very last game he played, a Test against New Zealand in Dunedin. Shane Bond got him out in both innings of that match, so at least he doesn’t have to worry about facing him any more since he quit cricket a decade back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/13/fawad-alam-pakistan-comeback-ugly-but-earned-after-decade-of-graft">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rigour was Michael Gove’s watchword. But the pandemic has exposed the exam system he built as brittle</p><p>That wealthy pupils and fee-paying schools could tighten their grip on elite universities as a result of the pandemic is not just unfair but grotesque. Yet this is the prospect England faces: a future of entrenched inequality digging in another notch. By using schools’ past performance to determine this year’s A-level grades, ministers chose to favour those with long-established advantages over the up-and-coming. Evidence shows that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/13/england-a-level-downgrades-hit-pupils-from-disadvantaged-areas-hardest" title="">pupils from lower socioeconomic backgrounds</a> are more likely to have had their teachers’ grades overruled, while the gap between pupils on free school meals and others has widened. For a government and, more than that, a country, that is supposed to have rejected the rigid hierarchies of the past in favour of social mobility (at least in principle), results day could hardly have gone more wrong.</p><p>The education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has handled the situation poorly. His <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/11/keir-starmer-england-must-alter-course-on-a-level-grades" title="">11th-hour announcement</a> that the results calculated by Ofqual’s algorithm could in some cases be discarded in favour of mock exam grades revealed weak judgment as well as a lack of planning. When clarity was the minimum that pupils were entitled to, on what is an anxious day even in normal times, the signals have been of panic and muddle. That the situation in England has unfolded in the way that it has, even after a similar row in Scotland, is particularly concerning. Ministers and officials should have seen what was coming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/13/the-guardian-view-on-a-levels-ministers-not-pupils-have-failed">Continue reading...</a>

## Mesut Özil's groundhog act ensures Arteta's plan for Arsenal remains cloudy | Nick Ames

<p>Özil’s refusal to leave north London leaves Mikel Arteta in a tough spot considering all signs point to the German being surplus to requirements</p><p>Mesut Özil retains his unnatural gift for dominating Arsenal’s narrative. This may yet be the week when, in announcing the signing of Willian and confirming Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has signed his new contract, they take their first clear steps towards rebounding from a tormented season and showing their intent to progress under Mikel Arteta. But Özil’s most recent intervention, stating in an interview that he has no desire to depart, brought back into focus a long-standing and expensive problem that is no nearer to resolution.</p><p>Arsenal already have a battle to master the optics given, for all the relief Aubameyang’s retention in particular would give those whose only care is for the football, the imminent deals will cost more than £400,000 a week combined. That may look conservative when bonuses are factored in. They come at a time when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/05/arsenal-plan-55-redundancies-to-enable-us-to-continue-to-invest-in-the-team-impact-covid-19-revenue">55 staff elsewhere in the club</a> are subject to proposed redundancy; if Özil sticks around for the final year of his contract, keeping another £350,000 on the weekly wage bill, the picture looks even more warped.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/aug/13/mesut-ozil-mikel-artetas-plan-arsenal-remains-cloudy">Continue reading...</a>

Time for a more enjoyable alternative<br /></p><p>When I was nine, I thought adult glamour was owning one of those really flat Italian racers, the kind that beat everything else in Top Trumps Supercars. In my early teens, having grown up significantly, I realised that sophistication was in fact one of those 1980s frothy cocktails, with a sparkler in it. Towards the end of my teens, I finally recognised a much more mature, achievable and immeasurably less stupid goal than a flaming drink or a motor with no legroom: the business lunch.</p><p>I imagined myself filling the windows of my leatherette-bound Filofax with pencilled arrangements for deliciously gossipy meals, out of which marvellous plans would bubble organically. This, it seemed to me, was the very essence of being a grown-up. Over a sparkling aperitif I would be sounded out about some new shiny-floored TV project, and I would lean in across the table, so as to project my best “I’m very interested” face. During the starters I would bag a commission for a magazine cover story. As they cleared away the remains of my lamb rump with borlotti beans my companion and I would plot our route to career greatness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/13/thanks-to-covid-19-the-business-lunch-is-dead-heres-how-to-revive-it">Continue reading...</a>

But viewing figures for @kurtsworld96 remain stubbornly in single digits. So Kurt has found employment in the gig economy, working as a driver for a taxi hailing app called Spree.

<p>The story, told with free-wheeling gusto, of four German thinkers – Martin Heidegger, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Cassirer and Ludwig Wittgenstein – before the dark decade of the 1930s</p><p>Wolfram Eilenberger’s new book offers us a group portrait of four brilliant young philosophers in the aftermath of the first world war. His awesome foursome is made up of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/jun/05/heidegger-philosophy">Martin Heidegger</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/07/walter-benjamin-critical-life-howard-eiland-michael-w-jennings-review">Walter Benjamin</a>, Ernst Cassirer and – the only one who actually saw military action –<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/26/ludwig-wittgenstein-philosopher-profile"> Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>. They make a pretty bizarre team: they were all conceptual innovators, but they innovated in different directions, and ended up with hardly anything in common apart from the fact that their mother tongue was German. If they had all ever met over <em>Kaffee</em> <em>und Kuchen</em> – which they certainly did not – they would probably have disagreed about everything. According to Eilenberger, however, they were united by the “spirit of the age”, which led them to “break away from the old frameworks (family, religion, nation, capitalism)”, and construct a new model of existence commensurate with “the experience of war”. They struck lucky, it would seem, and Eilenberger hails them as the “magicians” who made the 1920s into “philosophy’s great decade”.</p><p>Regardless of what may have happened in their lifetimes, Eilenberger’s magicians have since drifted far apart. Wittgenstein and Heidegger are now world-famous as patrons of two philosophical tribes – the sober linguistic analysts and the wild deconstructive existentialists – who are barely on speaking terms; Benjamin, the mystical Marxist, has a following but a cultish one; and as for poor old Cassirer, he seems to have no followers at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/13/time-of-the-magicians-by-wolfram-eilenberger-review-philosophys-great-decade">Continue reading...</a>

The global greenback is doomed! screamed <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/covid19-shock-rapid-dollar-depreciation-by-stephen-s-roach-2020-06">recent headlines</a>. Actually, such sensational headlines are “<a href="https://economicsociology.org/2018/08/25/the-melodramatic-side-of-political-economy/">too sensational</a>”, to echo that noted authority on currencies, Miss Prism, in Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest.</p><p>The dollar’s fall in July to a two-year low against the euro was the immediate impetus for these stories. In fact, the dollar’s recent slide is one in a series of readily explicable fluctuations. When the Covid-19 pandemic went global in March, the dollar strengthened on the back of safe-haven flows into US Treasuries, as it does at the start of every crisis. By May, the Federal Reserve, acting as global lender of last resort, had accommodated this mad scramble for dollars by pouring buckets of liquidity into financial markets and the greenback gave back its early gains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/13/forget-doom-laden-headlines-the-dollar-has-not-gone-into-terminal-decline">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spying a $100m boat in a Croatian harbour has brought up some complicated feelings about the super-rich </p><p>I had to read my electricity meter last month. It caused me some alarm to see how speedily that disc thingy spun. The only thing I had on was the oven. I switched it off and ate raw vegetables instead. A week later I was in Dubrovnik, Croatia; close by, a superyacht called Clio <a href="https://www.boatinternational.com/yachts/the-superyacht-directory/clio--60573#:~:text=CLIO%20is%20a%2072.6m,people%20with%2021%20crew%20members.">was anchored off the island of Mljet</a>. A friend who knows about these things told me it would cost between €500 (£450) and €1,000 an hour in fuel alone; to fill the fuel tank would cost about €200,000. The owner must be very relaxed about spinning discs. Then again, if you can afford $6m (£4.5m) a year for its upkeep, and about $100m to buy it in the first place, your heart probably won’t miss a beat when you read the meter. By the way, I appreciate that I’m mixing currencies here, but that’s superyachting for you: by its nature you get around a bit.</p><p>Nearby was an odd-shaped ship called Sputnik. This, it turned out, was the support vessel for Clio, which, we must conclude, even at a length of 72 metres, lacks space. Sputnik sports a helipad, a hangar and several tenders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/13/ive-seen-an-oligarchs-superyacht-and-now-im-channeling-bernie-sanders">Continue reading...</a>

<p>During my medical training, it was almost always assumed that my patients would be white. That prejudice is harmful in its own right – and when it comes to dangerous skin conditions, it can be deadly. By Neil Singh</p><p>As I sat making small talk with my patient, I was trying not to think about the ants. It was “flying ant day”: that moment every summer when the heat inspires thousands of ants to grow wings and swarm in their thousands, mating mid-air in a huge, frenzied orgy. My only source of cool air was a skylight, but having it open meant that every so often stray black garden ants were dropping between me and my patients, making me jumpy.</p><p>My patient was a rangy black man, early 40s, with hair just starting to grey at the temples. He looked younger than he was, wearing a black T-shirt and cut-off denim shorts. It was well into music festival season, and he wore several wristbands to prove it. I asked what kind of music he was into. It turned out he was not just a music fan; he was a roadie and gig manager. He had come in to ask me about his skin. He lifted up his T-shirt, showing me his chest, and I was shocked to see a splash of rough, silvery patches all over his torso.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/13/decolonising-dermatology-why-black-and-brown-skin-need-better-treatment">Continue reading...</a>
