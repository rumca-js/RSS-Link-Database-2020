I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s my #IBD acting up or what, but I wanted to take a minute to let you know I have some great book news and a couple new videos to share\u2014when I\u2019m healthy again. I\u2019m still at the hospital and don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll be back home yet. Sorry I couldn\u2019t do any fancy effects, this is the first time I did a video on my iPhone!\n\nI also didn\u2019t think it wise to bring all my video equipment to the hospital, not when I was spiking a major fever at least...\n\nAnd THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who has shown their support, especially my Patrons and GitHub Sponsors!\n\nHere\u2019s a link to that blog post: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/heaping-helpings-hospital-humor-healing\n\n#Crohns #IBDvisible", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP7As78hgAs", "date_published": "2020-08-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
