<p>This clear-eyed series follows the work of jobcentre staff in Leeds, as they deal with the needs of 600 people a day – each with their own challenges</p><p>In her forthcoming book, More Than a Woman, the writer Caitlin Moran posits the Janet Theory. This is the working assumption that whenever you have unfortunate occasion to interface with a utility company, service provider, any apparatus of the state, a customer helpline or similar, you must simply keep ringing, calling back, holding on until at last you are connected with a slightly weary but essentially compassionate woman in late middle age. Probably called Janet, she will solve your three-month-long difficulty in three minutes, bid you good day and be on to the next call while you are still trying to process what has happened. Less an employee, more a benediction.</p><p><a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/tv-programme/e/mjygnq/the-yorkshire-jobcentre--s1-e1-the-yorkshire-jobcentre/">The Yorkshire Jobcentre</a> (Channel 4) adduces further empirical proof of the Janet Theory, thanks to the phalanx of work coaches – one of whom is actually named Jan – who are employed by the Southern House jobcentre in Leeds, who deal with the myriad needs and problems of the 600 (out of 29,000 unemployed in the city) seeking work and benefits who come through its doors every day. There are those who have never worked, and those who have always worked who now gaze, stunned after a sudden redundancy, at the endlessly patient staff as they try to get to grips with this strange new world of hoops to jump through to secure that £80 a week (minus sanctions, if you make – however inadvertently – a mistake, or the computer does). There are those who are hostile, frustrated, worn down, depressed and there are those who are still optimistic – often determinedly so, digging deep into reserves of strength and energy – and up for anything. There are a few who don’t want to work, vastly outnumbered by the proportion desperate for employment, and Jan, Bernie, Amma and the centre’s manager Alison tackle them all with sympathy, strictness and clear-eyed practicality blended in perfect proportions for each. “I’ll settle for baby steps sometimes,” says Jan after what will turn out to be a series of unproductive meetings with customer Pamela Anderson (yes, really – a young man lifts his eyes from his phone when her name is called, just in case), “because sometimes that’s all that’s available.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/10/the-yorkshire-jobcentre-review-the-truth-about-benefits">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While ITV’s bite-sized takes on being black and British promise much, the opening episode tells a story many viewers will have heard time and again</p><p>Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, Unsaid Stories (ITV) is a collection of four timely short films told from the perspective of black Britons, which are – according to its makers – “unique, fresh and engaging, about real people in completely real situations, confronting and exploring racism and prejudice”. With each episode just 15 minutes long, they offer a bite-sized take on issues such as racial profiling, colourism and unconscious bias. Each film is character-led –<strong> </strong>partially owing to filming restrictions brought about by Covid-19.</p><p>The first episode, Generational, written by Jerome Bucchan-Nelson, stars Nicholas Pinnock of Top Boy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/05/marcella-review-skilful-scandi-noir-comes-to-london-knitwear-and-all">Marcella</a> as Oliver, and Yasmin Monet Prince, best known for her role in Amazon’s Hanna, as Justina. Against the backdrop of the pandemic, the pair play a father and daughter with opposing views of the Black Lives Matter protests. Opening with the strains of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/mar/03/dave-psychodrama-interview-black-is-confusing">Black by rapper Dave</a> – with lines like “Black is so much deeper than just African American” – the scene is set for a nuanced portrayal of race in the UK. Justina’s mother is a healthcare worker, emphasising the risks that black people have faced over the past few months during a pandemic where they have been four times as likely to die as their white counterparts, and seemingly feeding into Oliver’s reluctance to let his daughter join in with the protests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/10/unsaid-stories-black-lives-matter-itv-films">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Available online<br /></strong>From the carefree romantic opening to the confused carnage of the battlefield, Akademi’s production is full of emotional detail</p><p>It’s 1888 when Lehna and Leela meet in an Amritsar marketplace. They are stopped in their tracks, eyes widen with curiosity and shy smiles, and there is a quivering bolt of feeling. This is a love at first sight you can invest in. The Troth takes place against the great tragedy of the first world war and the deaths of 60,000 Indian soldiers who served in the British army. But it is always the personal, emotional details that connect us to such mass devastation.</p><p>Leela (Vidya Patel), alas, is betrothed to another man. And yet years later, when the men go to war, the devotion of Lehna (Subhash Viman Gorania) leads him to make a momentous promise to her. The story is Usne Kaha Tha, written by Chandradhar Sharma Guleri in 1915 (also a 1960 film). This version was conceived by Mira Kaushik, director of south Asian dance organisation <a href="https://akademi.co.uk/">Akademi</a>. Choreographer Gary Clarke evokes the confused carnage of war, even when there are only four dancers on stage. The lost faces, the scramble to survive and the visceral weight of a bleeding body being dragged across a battlefield – all are bolstered by Shri Sriram’s music and the incredible projections of archive film footage: sepia-toned troops marching, soldiers digging trenches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/10/the-troth-review-a-beautiful-brutal-tale-of-love-and-sacrifice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Perhaps it was inevitable that in being a leader, an ambassador, an entertainer and a salesman, something had to give</p><p>Three years ago, I went to Sheffield to interview Joe Root. It was his first summer as England captain and as he parsed his way through a series of solemn, proportionate answers about New Responsibilities and Exciting Opportunities, I became increasingly fascinated by his demeanour. His posture was nervous and awkward; his gestures self-conscious and uncertain; his words stilted and punctuated by short involuntary intakes of breath. It seemed like Root still was still trying to work out whether the England captaincy was something into which you grow or shrink. Whether it bottles you up or sets you free.</p><p>A couple of weeks later, someone in the England camp informed me Root had read my article and was a little put out. Not angry. Not upset. Just a bit surprised, as anyone might be if they’d seen their verbal tics and physical mannerisms deconstructed in creepily forensic detail in a national newspaper. Even so, Root’s reaction struck me as atypical. If this was his response to a largely innocuous slice of cod-psychology, how would he handle the merciless media roastings, the poison-pen campaigns, the barefaced lies to come? The England captaincy, after all, is hardly a job for someone who cares what other people think.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/10/innocent-fun-joe-root-lost-burdens-of-england-captaincy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The popular outrage following Alexander Lukashenko’s rigged election victory is unprecedented. The west should show active solidarity with the opposition’s demand for change </p><p>Nigel Gould-Davies, the former British ambassador to Minsk, has described current events in Belarus as “the last phase of a great re-ordering of European politics that began in 1989”. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2019/oct/16/how-communist-europe-was-swept-by-a-tide-of-change-archive-1989" title="">Three decades ago</a>, as democracy was restored to eastern Europe, Belarus found itself travelling down a different road, led by the former collective farm director, Alexander Lukashenko. On his election as president in 1994, Mr Lukashenko set about establishing an effective dictatorship, sustained by shamelessly rigged elections. Only now, over a quarter of a century later, is his corrupt grip on power loosening, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/09/belarus-election-lukashenko-landslide-victory-fixing-claims" title="">unprecedented protests</a> sweep the country following yet another fraudulent poll.</p><p>According to Belarus’s election commission, the 65-year-old Mr Lukashenko won 80.23% of Sunday’s vote. His main challenger, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, scored a mere 9.9%, despite having held the biggest rallies in the country since the days of the Soviet Union. In securing this Soviet-style endorsement, the Lukashenko regime operated according to its usual playbook.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/10/the-guardian-view-on-belarus-europes-last-dictator-loses-his-grip">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The open-ended worlds of The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption 2 can arouse the housebound traveller’s sense of adventure</p><p>There is only one entrance to the city of Solitude. Its gates are set in a colossal stone wall that lies across the summit of a steep stone path amid a forest of fir trees. Arriving this way suggests nothing of the grandeur beyond. If you approach via the Karst river to the south or its swampy delta to the east, a mandible of buildings is visible, stretching high across an arching stone bridge. To the right, flashes of sunlight reflect off the windows of the Blue Palace. A cluster of sloped roofs, a windmill and turreted towers lie along its breadth. Far left and higher still, mountains covered in snow and pine trees spire into the clouds.</p><p>The city of Solitude hugs the far north-west coast of the fictional region of Haafingar, a land in the video game The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Like the rest of Skyrim, it is a place created to wander and explore at the pace of your choosing. Inhabitants initiate conversation, sometimes leading you to quests, other times just enriching your experience. Despite being nearly a decade old, the game still hosts millions of players a year, and remains one of the most beautiful and intricately detailed destinations accessible from the couch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/aug/11/since-travel-is-off-the-cards-for-now-im-exploring-the-vast-terrain-of-video-game-worlds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The scampish prince and his duchess definitely have a story to tell, but it is not the story in this book</p><p>Prince Harry – HRH as was – has long had to endure cruel snarks about, among other things, his paternity, yet in <em>Finding Freedom</em>, he confirms one thing beyond a doubt: he is 100% his mother’s son. Just as 1992’s <em>Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words, </em>by Andrew Morton, gave readers an intimate look at the royal family from the perspective of a disgruntled member of the firm, so this book repeats the trick with Diana’s younger son and his wife, Meghan Markle. What this semi-sequel lacks in novelty, it makes up for in cattiness (aimed largely – and this is the only real surprise of the book – at the woman born Kate Middleton, now known as Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. We’ll return to that in a tick.)</p><p>Writers Carolyn Durand and Omid Scobie insist Harry and Meghan were not involved in the book. Given the deluge of personal minutiae – from Harry’s emoji habit to Meghan’s favourite hair highlight shades – as well as their litigiousness when it comes to undesired invasions of privacy (they are currently engaged in legal battles with the Mail on Sunday and an American paparazzo), this seems about as credible as Diana’s similar protestations of innocence, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/interview-andrew-morton-he-couldnt-shout-diana-was-in-on-this-she-trusted-me-it-would-have-been-a-1286288.html">all of which Morton scotched</a> about 10 seconds after she died. But whereas Diana chose a tabloid hack as her Boswell, who knew a good story when he saw it, Harry and Meghan opted for two royal journalists. This means the reader is subjected to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/feb/14/private-eye-old-jokes-best">Sylvie Krin style</a> of writing that is de rigeur in the genre (I could just about stomach Harry and his “famed ginger locks”, but details of his and Meghan’s glamping trip to Botswana, on which “their days were spent getting closer to nature and their evenings, closer to each other” made me briefly furious that the book hadn’t come with a health warning). Less forgivable than the predictable fluff is how the authors fluff the tale. Because Harry and Meghan definitely have a story to tell, but it is not the story in this book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/10/finding-freedom-by-omid-scobie-and-carolyn-durand-harry-and-meghan-and-the-making-of-a-modern-royal-family">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I still had my old job when it went to No 1. There were women chasing me across the factory floor’</p><p>I still had a day job at a laboratory when the melody for In the Summertime entered my head. The lyric took 10 minutes to write. When I was young, my family always went to Hayling Island, in Hampshire, for holidays; great affairs with about 20 of us. So, for part of the song, I was recalling lovely childhood memories. “In the summertime, when the weather is high” meant high pressure, when it’s not raining and you have that sense of euphoria where you feel “you can stretch right up and touch the sky”. Singing “have a drink, have a drive” meant just a coke, a coffee or a milkshake in the days before drink became a generic term for alcohol.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/10/how-we-made-mungo-jerry-in-the-summertime">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Available online</strong><br />Moving Edinburgh’s international festival online, this selection of dance works shows a forward-thinking ballet company<br /><br /></p><p>As a gallant effort to keep the show on the road (or the screen) despite the cancellation of this summer’s edition, Edinburgh international festival has commissioned <a href="https://www.eif.co.uk/whats-on/2020/scottishballet-film">An Evening with Scottish Ballet</a>. Although “evening” is pushing it, as this is more like a half-hour sizzle reel. Six short films packaged together, old and new, plus existing choreography filmed especially for Covid times by director Michael Sherrington.</p><p>There are two pieces from the company’s resident choreographer <a href="https://www.scottishballet.co.uk/profile/sophie-laplane">Sophie Laplane</a>, full of stylish staccato riffs set to 4/4 machine beats. It’s a distinctive style, very watchable. In Oxymore, Rishan Benjamin and Anna Williams dance backstage in front of towers of flight cases and props. Their movement is straight-faced and straight-angled, a kind of un-groovy groove. Idle Eyes, filmed last year, is glitchier and quirkier, and benefits from the texture of a bigger cast, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/10/an-evening-with-scottish-ballet-review-online-dance-edinburgh-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With almost no scope for overturning the estimated A-level and GCSE grades, parents and students are expected to just take them</p><p>In July, I thought the major risk of this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/08/poorer-students-will-suffer-in-unfair-a-level-grading-model-uk-parents-warn">extraordinary exam results season</a> would be the unconscious bias of teachers when they made their predictions of student grades. The effects might be quite subtle, and universities would have to be correspondingly nuanced in their response. I have to say, it never occurred to me that teachers would be broadly disregarded, and instead, any existing disparity between the private and state sectors, between affluent and deprived areas, would be baked in by design.</p><p>There is a political complacency to all this, an assumption that parents and students will simply weather it. And so here we are: a fortnight ago in Scotland, students from richer areas saw their predicted grades, if they were A to C, <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-anger-over-scottish-exam-grades-likely-to-be-repeated-across-the-uk">reduced by </a><a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-anger-over-scottish-exam-grades-likely-to-be-repeated-across-the-uk">seven percentage point</a>; in the poorer areas, 15. This, apparently, was to preserve “credibility” – if there had always been better grades in these richer areas, what would the world make of a year in which the poorer kids did somewhat less badly? What would it mean for the students of 2019 and 2021, to be sandwiched either side of this freak year in which deprivation didn’t show (so much)?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/10/exam-results-inequality-private-state-students">Continue reading...</a>

At Magor Marsh you can walk along boardwalks near where monks once worked to reclaim the land from the sea, through reed beds with Cetti’s warblers singing wildly, water voles dashing off, the sound of distant cuckoos floating on the air and plenty of waterfowl.

<p>Ben Walsby, 45, and Laura Rudel, 39, met in Syria in 2012, during the early stages of the war. They are living apart due to the pandemic, but hope to reunite soon</p><p>Ben Walsby was working as a human rights officer for the UN when he travelled to Damascus, Syria, for a peacekeeping mission in May 2012. A friend gave him the number of Laura Rudel, a refugee worker from Rome. “I didn’t know anyone, so I arranged to meet her for a drink,” says Ben. “When he arrived, he was on the phone discussing a serious crisis. The first thing I noticed about him was how much he cared,” says Laura.</p><p>After a few drinks, he relaxed and they talked about their shared love of Italy. At the end of the week, Laura invited him to meet her for dinner with some colleagues. “It took me for ever to decide what to wear,” says Ben, “so I knew I must like her.” Towards the end of the evening, Ben noticed Laura flirting with a co-worker. “I arrogantly told her she should choose me instead,” he laughs. She responded by throwing a drink in his face. “It was a shock reaction,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/10/how-we-met-we-were-being-fired-at-by-a-sniper">Continue reading...</a>

Twice is a miracle, three and you call in the fraud squad”. The interview is winding up when the Granada TV presenter-turned-mogul gets on to what is, at this point, his latest would-be masterstroke. He has just set up music33.com, an online record shop selling individual songs – as MP3s to download – for 33p a time, because, back then, the public are “fed up with trawling around record shops to find albums which have three good tracks and they’re the singles anyway.
