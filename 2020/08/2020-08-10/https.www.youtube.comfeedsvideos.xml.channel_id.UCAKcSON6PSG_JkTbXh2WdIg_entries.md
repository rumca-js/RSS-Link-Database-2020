Three years ago this week, Jason Isbell released the stunning, animated video for his song, "If We Were Vampires." The song struck a powerful chord with The Current's listeners; in fact, it went on to become the No. 1 song in The Current's Top 89 of 2017, as voted by listeners. In honor of all that, we're sharing three songs performed for The Current by Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit: one is from a 2018 session in the Forum at MPR; the next is from a 2016 in-studio session hosted by Bill DeVille; and the third comes from Isbell's summer 2019 concert at the Armory in Minneapolis, which was streamed live by The Current.
