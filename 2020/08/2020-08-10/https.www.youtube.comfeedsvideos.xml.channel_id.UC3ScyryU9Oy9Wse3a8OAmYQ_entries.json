This Teacher Took Her Newborn In | FRONTLINE", "description": "Zully was around eight months pregnant when she began to cough and wheeze. Then came the hospitalization, the COVID-19 diagnosis \u2014 and word that because the baby\u2019s oxygen levels were dropping, he\u2019d have to be delivered weeks early.\n\r\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\r\n\r\nFor Zully and her family, who emigrated to Stamford, Connecticut from Guatemala, it was a crisis moment: Her husband, Marvin, and seven-year-old son, Junior, were also believed to be infected with the coronavirus \u2014 meaning that once the baby was born, it wouldn\u2019t be safe for him to go home to them.\n\n\u201cI would\u2019ve turned into my son\u2019s assassin,\u201d Marvin says.\n\nZully (above, left) had nowhere else to turn. In early April, just before giving birth on a ventilator and being put into a coma that would last for nearly three weeks, she made a desperate phone call to her older son\u2019s English as a Second Language teacher, Luciana Lira (above, right) \u2014 an immigrant herself \u2014 saying that Marvin and Junior needed help.\n\nLira didn\u2019t hesitate. Ultimately, she would go on to take the baby, Neysel, into her home to keep him safe from the virus as his mother, father and brother recovered from it.\n\n\u201cI am willing to help, 100 percent,\u201d the teacher recalls saying.\n\r\nWatch the full story - \"Love, Life & the Virus\" - starting Tues., Aug. 11: https://to.pbs.org/2PGRsyo\n\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\r\n\r\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \r\n\r\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
