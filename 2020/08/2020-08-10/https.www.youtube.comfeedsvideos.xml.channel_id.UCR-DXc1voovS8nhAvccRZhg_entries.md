Hey, it’s me... back in the hospital again. I’m not sure if it’s my #IBD acting up or what, but I wanted to take a minute to let you know I have some great book news and a couple new videos to share—when I’m healthy again. I’m still at the hospital and don’t know when I’ll be back home yet. Sorry I couldn’t do any fancy effects, this is the first time I did a video on my iPhone!

I also didn’t think it wise to bring all my video equipment to the hospital, not when I was spiking a major fever at least...

And THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who has shown their support, especially my Patrons and GitHub Sponsors!
