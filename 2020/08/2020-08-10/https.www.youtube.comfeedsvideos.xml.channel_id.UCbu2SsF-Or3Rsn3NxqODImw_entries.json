We saw a variety pf weapons that specialized in different things like bullets that can ricochet and homing ammunition that can follow targets. Melee weapons and Cyberware were also a part of the arsenal that was featured and will provided multiple ways to play depending on your choice of equipment. \n\nPersia also talks about the recent addition of two trophies that indicate Grounded difficulty and Permadeath mode are coming to The Last Of Us Part II. Grounded difficulty removes your HUD and Listen Mode while also making your enemies stronger and ammunition more scarce. Permadeath is obvious: one life and that's it. But you can complete the Permadeath mode on any setting for the trophy. \n\nAnd lastly, Persia talks about the mysterious boxes that streamers and fan sites have been getting that may hint at the next Call of Duty game. There have been may rumors about Black Ops Cold War, but the boxes included old-fashioned projectors and slides that fans say resemble old multiplayer maps like Summit. Treyarch also changed its header image to a picture of snowy mountains, but not official word has been given yet on what all of these teasers really mean.\n\nDon't forget to check out store.gamespot.com when you get a chance to buy Play For All merch because all the proceeds will be donated to Black Lives Matter and Direct Relief until the end of August!\n\nThis is your Save State for Monday, August 10th.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:18 - We Saw A Bunch Of New Cyberpunk 2077 Weapons\n01:09 - Next Call Of Duty Teased With A Slide Projector\n02:03 - Last Of Us Part 2 Is Getting A Permadeath Mode", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y4aJAbK0aA0", "date_published": "2020-08-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Is The Katana Overrated? - Loadout", "description": "The Katana is one of the most legendary swords in fiction and in real world history, but it\u2019s also one of the most misunderstood weapons.\n\nAn iconic part of Japanese culture and history, the Katana has also established itself as an icon of pop culture with appearances in everything from games like Ghost of Tsushima and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice through to the classic samurai films of Akira Kurosawa.\n\nOn this episode of Loadout we take a look at some of the tropes and misconceptions that surround the legendary weapon of the Samurai, as we break down the myth and legend of the Katana.\n\nYou can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries/\n\nWatch previous episodes of Loadout here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzSrmGkpWKk&list=PLpg6WLs8kxGMzIemU1gyyLmg5VlKI2UvC", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJZU_zqXXv8", "date_published": "2020-08-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 - Guns Explained: Power, Tech, and Smart Weapons | Night City Wire Ep. 2", "description": "Cyberpunk 2077 devs breakdown the three primary types of firearm: power, tech, and smart.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:20 - Combat Trailer\n03:07 - Power, Tech, and Smart Explained\n04:55 - Where to find weapons\n05:59 - Weapon modifications", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNTTLEQyCQk", "date_published": "2020-08-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Life Paths Explained: Street Kid, Nomad, Corpo | Night City Wire Ep. 2", "description": "CD Projeckt Red devs explain the three life paths you can play in Cyberpunk 2077: Street Kid, Nomad, and Corpo.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vylm7zrPnq0", "date_published": "2020-08-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Night City Wire Livestream (Episode 2)", "description": "Tune in for the second episode of Night City Wire, during which we'll learn details about Lifepaths, different weapon types you can use in the game, and discuss Refused's transformation into SAMURAI for Cyberpunk 2077.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GzKW7skUNw", "date_published": "2020-08-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Night City Wire Livestream - Pre- And Post-Show", "description": "Tune in for the second episode of Night City Wire, during which we'll learn details about Lifepaths, different weapon types you can use in the game, and discuss Refused's transformation into SAMURAI for Cyberpunk 2077.
