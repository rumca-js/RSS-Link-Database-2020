In honor of all that, we're sharing three songs performed for The Current by Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit: one is from a 2018 session in the Forum at MPR; the next is from a 2016 in-studio session hosted by Bill DeVille; and the third comes from Isbell's summer 2019 concert at the Armory in Minneapolis, which was streamed live by The Current.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"If We Were Vampires\" (2018, the Forum)\n4:06 \"Flagship\" (2016, studio)\n9:12 \"Hope The High Road\" (2019, the Armory, Minneapolis)\n\nPERSONNEL\nJason Isbell \u2013 vocals, guitar\nAmanda Shires \u2013 fiddle, harmony vocals\nSadler Vaden \u2013 guitar\nJimbo Hart \u2013 bass, backing vocals\nDerry DeBorja \u2013 keys\nChad Gamble - drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Erik Stromstad; Veronica Rodriguez; Maury Jensen; Michael DeMark; Sasha Druva\nProduction: Anna Weggel; Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2018 session in the Forum: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/07/16/jason-isbell-and-the-400-unit-perform-in-the-forum-at-mpr\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/02/28/jason-isbell-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2019 concert at the Armory in Minneapolis:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/06/16/watch-jason-isbell-and-the-400-unit-live-concert-minneapolis\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QLTNNKrqws", "date_published": "2020-08-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
