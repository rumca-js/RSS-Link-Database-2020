## First Love review – park bench vagrant weaves compelling tale in Beckett play

<p><strong>Rowntree Park, York</strong> <br />This tangled monologue – delivered to a socially spaced audience with emphatic charm by Chris Hannon – is a diverting way to bring open-air theatre back to life</p><p>First Love is a bit of a surprise. For one thing, it’s startling that Samuel Beckett ever wrote anything with such a seemingly sentimental title. Written in 1946, before any of the plays for which Beckett would become most famous, the short story is a typically strange, cynical and blackly comic take on romance. A Beckett piece is also an unexpected choice for open-air theatre – usually the preserve of family-friendly shows and Shakespeare in the park. But something about it works.</p><p>Instead of opting for something clunkily topical, the show that opens <a href="https://parkbenchtheatre.com/">Park Bench Theatre</a>’s short season of socially distanced performances has light, unforced resonances with the experience of coronavirus lockdown. It begins with death – that well-trodden Beckettian territory – and isolation is a running theme. The speaker is a reclusive character, shunning most human contact, and the love of the title is an odd and awkward union with a woman who intrudes on his solitude at the canalside bench where he’s sleeping. Becoming reluctantly infatuated with this stranger, his attempts to break their unexpected bond only bring the two closer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/16/first-love-review-park-bench-theatre-samuel-beckett-york">Continue reading...</a>

It kills a third of those who have it within a year, rising to a half by the end of year two, with no known cure. Devastated as Peter was, he’d already decided this was negotiable. Fortunately, long before his own diagnosis, he had been fascinated by the idea of harnessing the power of modern technology to prolong human life.</p><p>Already a year had passed since his first symptoms had started appearing. After stepping out of the bath while on a trip to the Arctic Circle, he’d noticed that shaking the water from his feet as he emerged was suddenly and inexplicably out of his grasp. This was the earliest stage of the near-total paralysis that the condition would soon inflict on him. As the disease develops, messages sent from his brain and spinal cord would eventually stop reaching his muscles entirely – his body was failing him one piece at a time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/16/i-choose-to-thrive-the-man-fighting-motor-neurone-disease-with-cyborg-technology">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a world racked by disease, it’s lovely to debate which actor was almost as good as Sean Connery</p><p>The subject of who is the best James Bond is a difficult one on which to be interesting. As you’re about to find out. I really meant not to write about it but I couldn’t resist, simply because I find it so interesting. I reckon that’s probably why it’s tricky to be interesting about. Increasingly I think, when it comes to the risk of being boring, that’s the red flag: are you finding yourself interesting? If so, no one else is.</p><p>Bores are seldom themselves bored – they’re usually finding themselves fascinating, banging on about wiring, or gardening, or what people don’t understand about Charlemagne or who’s the best Bond. So, listening to a bore is like an offensive metaphor for global wealth inequality. The bores (representing the super-rich) droning on, becoming more and more interested, as everyone else gets more and more bored, until all of the world’s interestedness is in the possession of a tiny number of droning people, while the vast majority must scratch an existence in unremitting stultification.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/16/the-names-bond-second-best-bond">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author and academic on why smartphones have been a game changer in African Americans’ struggle against police brutality – and the ethics of sharing violent images</p><p><strong>In her new book, </strong><em><strong>Bearing Witness While Black</strong></em><strong>, </strong><strong>Allissa Richardson</strong><strong>, an assistant professor of journalism at the </strong><strong>University of Southern California</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>explores how video footage captured and shared by victims, activists and shocked bystanders has </strong><strong> </strong><strong>alerted the world to a struggle for justice </strong><strong>that has a very long history.</strong></p><p><strong>Did technology bring us to this moment?<br /></strong>Since African Americans reached American shores, they’ve been trying to communicate injustices that have been meted out against them using the technology of their day. We have icons like Frederick Douglass, who wrote three autobiographies to bear witness to slavery, and Ida B Wells whose <em>The Red Record</em> kept tally of lynchings in America. That spirit has deep roots. But now the tools helping carry that forward are smartphones and social media. For the very first time, millions of people can see these incidences of police brutality themselves – what happened and who did it – in quick time and without the need for legacy media. It is an amplification we didn’t have in the past and it has created some incredible political power.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/16/allissa-richardson-its-telling-that-were-ok-with-showing-black-people-dying">Continue reading...</a>

<p>No other European country has such a stratified sector, and this explains the rage at exams fiasco</p><p>The job of university admissions offices has been likened to landing a jumbo jet on a postage stamp. In their last year of school, pupils apply for up to five courses through Ucas. Universities then decide how many deserve the offer of a place, based on how many offers are usually accepted and then matched on results day.</p><p>It is a difficult task even in a normal year, yet the costs of getting it wrong are huge. If an institution under-recruits, it will have spare places, empty beds and financial problems. If it over-recruits, it will have overcrowded seminars, a worse staff-student ratio and discontented students, hitting league table positions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/16/for-better-or-worse-our-universities-are-hierarchical-its-why-a-levels-matter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Susan Smillie has spent the past three years living on her beloved sailing boat. But when the lockdown hit, she built a den from flotsam – and started living as a castaway</p><p>I am lying on my back in the den I made, my book perched like a little tent on my stomach. I stare at my bamboo roof and listen to a tapping sound – a carpenter bee nesting inside one of the canes, I decide. I’ve been lost in thought, and realise it’s late in the day – the last hour before the sun dips into the sea. There’s that soft quality of light, beaming through the gaps, painting everything in crazy stripes of gold and shade. The water has turned from jade to olive, as the light bounces off the posidonia beds beneath.</p><p>No one overlooks me – I’m hidden from view by vertiginous cliffs, slate and burnt orange; lush greenery, studded with berries and flowers. It is empty, this cove, which is why I’ve made myself a tiny home at one end of it. I always mean to come for a short time, and end up staying all day. The hours drift by. Time passes companionably, despite my being alone. Maybe it’s the familiarity of the shipping forecast playing from the radio on the shelf, the books like friends lined up alongside. It’s all of it… the sounds, the shelf, the bamboo roof. It’s the beauty of the natural setting, but it’s also that I’ve made it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/16/my-robinson-crusoe-fantasy-in-a-beach-den-hideaway">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Academy, Lon</strong><strong>don<br /></strong>A Danish art lover’s spectacular collection of works by Monet, Manet, Cézanne and others is full of intrigue and surprise</p><p>That people fall in love with paintings is no exaggeration. Consider the Manet still life in this exultantly beautiful show that was painted in the final summer of his life. It depicts five green pears<strong> </strong>in a basket. Each is singular and unique, five vital beings turning towards each other in companionable conversation, united in the golden circle of the basket.</p><p>The man who loved this painting was its owner, Danish collector <a href="https://ordrupgaard.dk/en/portfolio_page/the-collection/">Wilhelm Hansen</a><strong> </strong>(1868-1936), who used to show it to his dinner guests “as an extra dessert after the ice cream”. If this sounds like a plutocrat’s party trick, the feeling was completely sincere. Hansen loved and lost more than one Manet during the Danish banking crash of 1922, selling most of his French art to prop up his insurance company. But this Manet he kept, for its amazingly free brushstrokes, its greens running all the way from emerald to sultry viridian, its unshadowed joy in looking at the world even as life ebbs away. “A painter can say all he wants,” Manet once remarked, “with fruit or flowers or even clouds.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/16/gauguin-and-the-impressionists-royal-academy-london-review-wilhelm-hansen-copenhagen">Continue reading...</a>

It was a typically elegant line from the chancellor, but it also puts him in a bit of a bind.

With a humorous nod to the less glamorous aspects of publishing life – hastily defrosted canapés and eked-out warm white wine – the author of <em>One Day</em> and adaptor of the Patrick Melrose novels has thrown a series of Twitter book launches, amplifying new releases from writers including (but far beyond) the big names who will automatically elicit review space and window displays. The responses from the authors, especially the debutants, to gaining the imprimatur of a much-loved and huge-selling colleague, and from readers to discovering books to connect with in a time of such immense disconnection, has been powerful and touching. It’s a particularly nice example of someone paying it forward.</p><p>Nicholls’s virtual launches have been held every Thursday, the day new books are traditionally published in the UK, but this week’s will be his last.

<p>Short-term analysis of ways to save society, and indeed humanity, is useless </p><p>In a biology lesson about the bacterial growth curve, the parallels with the climate crisis were hard to miss. Stick bacteria in a test tube with food and their population will grow exponentially until, eventually, they run out of resources and kill themselves off. Even a couple of decades ago, the comparison with humanity’s predicament felt glaringly obvious; and we have not really strayed since from the inevitable path to extinction.</p><p>The hope seems to be that a big crisis might be the shock we need to change course. But we are living through the biggest global crisis for decades – and are travelling and consuming less as a result of the pandemic – yet it already seems unlikely that much will change. It’s easy enough to throw around the old adage “never waste a good crisis”.

Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign affairs chief, led a chorus of condemnation, rejecting last Sunday’s poll as “<a href="https://www.euronews.com/2020/08/11/eu-foreign-minister-belarus-elections-were-neither-free-nor-fair" title="">neither free nor fair</a>”.</p><p>Yet Europe’s righteous wrath and sanctions threats seem a tad confected. Nobody really expected Lukashenko to play fair. Democratic reform in Belarus, a country firmly stuck in Russia’s orbit, is not an EU priority. There is no discernible appetite for the kind of robust intervention that might actually make a difference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/16/erdogan-is-both-a-bully-and-a-menace-europe-ignores-him-at-its-peril">Continue reading...</a>

I expected someone to tap me on the shoulder and tell me I had to leave.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/16/first-lady-of-football-i-could-follow-a-game-as-well-as-any-sweaty-man">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The world’s greatest supermodel has been a fearless champion of diversity in fashion for decades. Now she’s relishing a moment of change</p><p>An upside of our new Zoom-operated civilisation is supposed to be the abolishment of lateness. It’s harder to justify when the commute is from your bed to the living room. Unless you’re Naomi Campbell, of course. Twenty minutes into waiting for her to join our call, a message pops up from a representative apologising that she’d be a few minutes late. Another 20 minutes and I’m told she’s “just working out how to sign in”. I’ve been expecting the wait, comparatively tame compared to the tales of four-hour stake-outs I’d heard from other journalists. </p><p>And then, suddenly, she enters, and the atmosphere changes even in a virtual room, international accent first and then the face that launched 1,000 covers; skin dewy and glowy, goddess-like; impossibly high cheekbones and honey-blonde highlights. “Hi,” she says coyly. Polite but unapologetic. It’s fascinating to witness in real time this acute awareness of her own mythology; an unspoken agreement with anyone she encounters that she will be operating according to her own time zone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/16/naomi-campbell-it-is-time-to-reset-the-supermodel-relishes-a-moment-of-change">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Paul Wolff’s 1930s images of a tennis match in silhouette have a graceful life of their own</p><p>In 1930, Dr Paul Wolff took a series of pictures of tennis players’ shadows for the German magazine <em>Die Dame</em>. The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.</p><p>In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/16/the-big-picture-shadow-play-in-1930s-germany">Continue reading...</a>
