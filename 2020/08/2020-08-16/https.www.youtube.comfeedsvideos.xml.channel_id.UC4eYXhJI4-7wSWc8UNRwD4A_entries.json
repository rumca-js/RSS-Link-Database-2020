Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAugust 17, 2020 | Bob Boilen - Norah Jones keeps the music tastefully spare on her seven records despite a number of collaborators, yet I've always wished to hear just her voice and her piano in a room. The unfortunate circumstances of our times have given us something beautiful. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, Norah Jones sits in her music room; it's just Norah, her upright piano, her poetry, and that golden voice. I first fell in love with that voice when I heard her debut album in 2002 and remember playing it on All Songs Considered that next week.\n\nHere Norah plays songs from her seventh record, Pick Me Up Off the Floor, songs that hold the world's weight and the power to uplift. You can hear that on \"I'm Alive,\" which she co-wrote with Jeff Tweedy. It's a song that at once feels the pain of politics and a pain that is personal. \"You feel your soul / Get hollowed-out / While the world implodes / You just live without.\" Yet the refrain is what lingers, \"Oh, I'm alive / Yes, I'm alive / But I'm alive / Oh, I'm alive.\" Thanks, Norah, for this beautiful affirmation.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"How I Weep\"\n\"Heartbroken, Day After\"\n\"I'm Alive\"\n\"To Live\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNorah Jones: vocals, piano\n\nCREDITS\nVideo by: Norah Jones; Audio by: Norah Jones; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0ZnzboaDSg", "date_published": "2020-08-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Seu Jorge: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert From The Archives", "description": "We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Seu Jorge\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/09/13/129754791/seu-jorge-tiny-desk-concert\n\n\nJasmine Garsd | September 13, 2010\n\nLike many in America, the first time I heard Seu Jorge was through his role as a melancholy singer in the movie The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou. His rendition of David Bowie classics mesmerized me. The ache of his thick, raw vocals is nearly unbearable. Perhaps it's something about a burly grown man whose voice seems about to give in to tears that's simply heartbreaking. Or perhaps it was the shock of hearing Bowie's music, which in its original incarnation was pure glam rock, sung by a boy from one of Rio de Janeiro's worst slums.\n\nIn his newest project, with the company of his fantastic band Almaz, Seu Jorge is far more versatile, almost as if the band were encouraging him to go to that bar, hit that dance floor, flirt with that supermodel. But no matter how smooth he is, he's still that melancholy guy who played Bowie on Steve Zissou's ship (not to mention his heartbreaking turn in the film City of God, as a victim of a sociopathic druglord). Jorge's covers of classic Brazilian songs like \"Saudosa Bahia' \u2014 which is about wanting to go back home \u2014 find him at his best.\n\nI've always been curious to find out what Seu Jorge sounds like live, and in this Tiny Desk Concert I finally got my answer: He sounds as powerful as he does on his records, if not better. And he loves to play live, feeding off the energy of the audience. Later, he mentioned to me \u2014 while on his fourth cigarette break; there's a reason behind this man's raspy voice \u2014 how much he enjoyed being able to play while sitting right next to audience members. Here's hoping he comes back soon.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ws_5-hiqao", "date_published": "2020-08-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
