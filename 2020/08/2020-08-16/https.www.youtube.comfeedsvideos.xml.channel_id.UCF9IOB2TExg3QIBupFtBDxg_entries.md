CDC, COVID-19 Infections in children

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html

Number and rate of cases, steadily increasing from March to July 2020

True incidence not known

As of 3rd August

0 – 17 years

22% of the US population

7.3% of all cases 

Hospitalization rates in children, significantly lower

It is unclear

If children are as susceptible to infection compared with adults

If they can transmit the virus as effectively as adults

Children likely have the same or higher viral loads

Children can spread the virus effectively in households and camp settings

Community mitigation measures and school closures, therefore low transmission so far

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html

Clinical Presentation

Incubation period, about the same as adults, at 2-14 days with an average of 6 days

Signs or symptoms of COVID-19 in children include:

Cough

Fever

Fatigue

Headache

Myalgia

Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Abdominal pain

Diarrhea

Nausea or vomiting

Poor appetite or poor feeding

May have many of these non-specific symptoms

May only have a few (such as only upper respiratory symptoms or only gastrointestinal symptoms)

May be asymptomatic 

16%

45%

Differential diagnosis

Influenza

Streptococcal pharyngitis

Allergic rhinitis

Lack of specificity of signs or symptoms, significant proportion of asymptomatic infections, symptom-based screening challenging

Severity of Illness in Children

Less likely to develop severe illness compared with adults

Still at risk of developing severe illness and complications

Rate of hospitalization,  8.0 per 100,000 population

(Adults 164.5 per 100,000 population)

hospitalization rates in children are increasing

1 in 3 children hospitalized were admitted to the intensive care unit, (same as hospitilized adults)

Increases risk

Certain underlying medical conditions

Infants (age under 1 year) 

Comorbidities

Medical complexity

Genetic

Neurologic

Metabolic

Obesity

Diabetes

Asthma

Chronic lung disease

Sickle cell disease

Immunosuppression

Hospitalization rates

Higher among Hispanic/Latino

Black

Complications

Respiratory failure

Myocarditis

Shock

Acute renal failure

Coagulopathy,

Multi-organ system failure

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)
