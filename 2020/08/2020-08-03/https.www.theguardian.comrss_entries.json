We are not expecting any changes to the interest rate or the asset-buying programme.</strong></p><p>At the June meeting, the BOE\u2019s monetary policy committee kept the Bank rate at 0.1% but pumped a further \u00a3100bn into the economy by raising its quantitative easing (QE) programme to \u00a3745bn. But the committee also slowed the pace of net gilt purchases to around \u00a36bn a week from \u00a313.5bn previously as liquidity problems in financial markets eased.</p><p>Our expectation is that the votes on both the policy rate and QE will be unanimous in favour of \u2018no change\u2019. But we expect the speed of gilt buying to be reined back further. The Bank of England is due to announce the reverse gilt auction sizes beyond 6 August and has hinted that the programme will run more or less to the end of the year. This suggests a weekly gilt purchase rate somewhere close to \u00a34bn per week in order to meet the total \u00a3745bn target at that point.</p><p> In trying to gauge the policy stance further ahead, we expect the committee to note that the economy has enjoyed further recovery momentum recently ...
