We're still waiting for the full patch notes to be released, but we've gotten a good look at the main additions.\n\nWarzone's map is expanding, with the stadium opening and the freight train beginning to loop around Verdansk. Meanwhile, Modern Warfare is getting four new maps: Suldal Harbor, Petrov Oil Rig, Livestock, and Verdansk International Airport--a piece of the Warzone map being imported into Modern Warfare's Ground War mode. Suldal Harbor, meanwhile, is a remake of the very first Call of Duty game's Harbor map.\n\nAs you might expect, the Season 5 update is big, clocking in between 34 and 54 GB depending on your platform. Tony goes into all these details in the video above.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsg-YvrXTg0", "date_published": "2020-08-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Game Pass Ultimate - Mobile Streaming Trailer", "description": "Project xCloud will bring over 100 Xbox games to your Android mobile devices with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.

Considering Sony's ownership rights over the character, and Insomniac's PlayStation exclusive Spidey game, this probably isn't a surprise. PS4 controllers will work with PS5 consoles, but not with PS5 games. Sony stated on the PlayStation Blog that PS5 games should take full control of the DualSense. Xbox is getting a new store, rebuilt to focus on loading screens and ease of use.\n\n00:20 - Spider-Man Is Coming To Avengers--But Only On PlayStation\n01:05 - PS4 Controllers Won't Work With PS5 Games\n01:50 - Xbox Is Getting A New Store", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krhuZIwp88M", "date_published": "2020-08-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
