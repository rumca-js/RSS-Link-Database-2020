Nor child, nor man, <br />Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey, <br />For I have lost the race I never ran: <br />A rathe December blights my lagging May; <br />And still I am a child, though I be old: <br />Time is my debtor for my years untold.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/aug/03/poem-of-the-week-long-time-a-child-by-hartley-coleridge">Continue reading...</a>

## Hold up: It's time to start taking Beyoncé's filmmaking seriously

<p>Not content with being the world’s most celebrated pop star, Beyoncé is emerging as a major figure in cinema too</p><p>Back in 2002, 20-year-old Beyoncé was appearing as Austin Powers’s love interest in Goldmember. She’s come some way since. In fact, as her visual album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/beyonce-unveils-trailer-for-disney-visual-album-black-is-king">Black Is King</a> drops, it’s safe to say that Beyoncé is now not just one of the biggest pop stars on the planet but one of the most significant film-makers too. Perhaps that hasn’t been recognised up to now due to her collaborative approach, which doesn’t fit into familiar “auteur” boxes, or because her visual work is not narrative-led, or presented through the usual cinematic channels, but as well as music, it’s clear Beyoncé has significant clout in film these days.</p><p>Exhibit A would be her outstanding <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with">Lemonade</a> visual album of 2016 (as with all her work, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rN-ElZwUADQ&amp;list=OLAK5uy_m9dO997hqyquaE-xTYmZUqhm2pyKbQj-k&amp;index=1">she is credited as co-director</a>). The film fused an array of influences – from Yoruba mythology to civil rights history and Afrofuturism – into a lush assertion of black femininity. It also demonstrated her deep knowledge of avant garde cinema. Among its references were Julie Dash’s pioneering 1991 indie Daughters of the Dust, Swiss video artist Pipilotti Rist, Jonas Mekas, David Lynch, Kasi Lemmons, Terence Nance and Terrence Malick (with whom co-director Kahlil Joseph worked).

<p>The Brooklyn-based novelist impresses with this toxic tale of four women caught in the dazzle of South Korean consumerism</p><p>South Korea is believed to have the highest plastic surgery rates in the world, with a third of women thought to have gone under the knife by 30. Eyelid surgery and jaw slimming are among the most popular procedures, and improving physical appearance isn’t just vanity – it’s an openly recognised way to get ahead in a cut-throat job market.</p><p>This makes a grimly fascinating background for Brooklyn-based Frances Cha’s vivid debut. She knows whereof she writes: she worked as travel and culture editor for CNN in Seoul, and <em>If I Had Your Face</em> follows four young women navigating life in this brutally competitive, consumerist city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/03/if-i-had-your-face-by-frances-cha-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The gloves and training wheels come off as a group of smart, poignantly naive and utterly insufferable Texas boys get together to simulate government<br /></p><p>It’s not clear to me if this is a heartwarming study in young people’s idealism or a Lord of the Flies bloodbath with smug feral demons in white T-shirts. It’s not clear if it’s funny or tragic, if it’s reality TV or reality itself. But Boys State is as exciting and moving as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/25/hoop-dreams-review-basketball-doc-slam-dunks-the-power-of-hope">Steve James’s high school basketball epic Hoop Dreams</a> was a generation ago, with its emotional rawness, its guileless patriotism and capacity for hurt and wonder. We watch, in what feels like real time, as a group of ambitious teenage boys – smart, poignantly naive, utterly insufferable – get brutally acquainted with Kipling’s two “impostors”: triumph and disaster.</p><p>It is the story of Boys State, a kind of annual debate club in the US for 16 and 17-year-olds organised by the American Legion, state by state, a project invented in 1937 – and there is, to put it delicately, a bit of a 1930s vibe about it. But it’s avowedly there to inculcate citizenship and leadership among America’s youth and reintroduce the values of reasoned argument to a generation addled by the social-media screaming match. Some of America’s biggest political legends took part in their youth, and the film shows the famous photo of a teenaged Bill Clinton shaking hands with JFK at his event. There are separate groups for girls and boys. Boys State is a little like the model UN, without the wussy liberal nonsense of pretending to be foreigners. The young people spend a week at the state capitol, run for pretend office, conduct boisterous debates and finally submit to a nerve-shredding election.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/03/boys-state-review-amazing-study-of-teenagers-running-for-pretend-office">Continue reading...</a>

Both of them, in other words, are the repressed products of a confused time.</p><p>The actors, by contrast, get along swimmingly.

It has also been a test of us – and government. How much do we – and it – recognise our sense of mutual dependence and obligation? Unprecedented steps such as the furlough, despite its significant injustice in the numbers excluded, have been a welcome expression of that.</p><p>Yet the government has chosen to move away from that approach, as every firm in the UK must now contribute to the costs of their employees’ furlough, a precursor to the end of the scheme in October. That rule applies to businesses whatever their sector or circumstance, including casinos and bowling alleys, which had been preparing to reopen their doors this Saturday but were told on Friday they’d have to delay. The unpredictable nature of this virus means that public health measures must be flexible, yet the government is illogically sticking to a rigid economic approach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/03/working-people-pay-price-tory-ideological-pandemic-response-furlough-scheme-ed-miliband">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is an urgent need for wide-ranging debt relief in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic</p><p>While the Covid-19 pandemic rages, more than 100 low- and middle-income countries will still have to pay a combined <a href="https://cepr.org/active/publications/policy_insights/viewpi.php?pino=104">$130</a><a href="https://cepr.org/active/publications/policy_insights/viewpi.php?pino=104">bn in debt service</a> this year – around half of which is owed to private creditors. With much economic activity suspended and fiscal revenues in free fall, many countries will be forced to default. Others will cobble together scarce resources to pay creditors, cutting back on much-needed health and social expenditures. Still others will resort to additional borrowing, kicking the proverbial can down the road, seemingly easier now because of the flood of liquidity from central banks around the world.</p><p>From Latin America’s lost decade in the 1980s to the more recent Greek crisis, there are plenty of painful reminders of what happens when countries cannot service their debts. A global debt crisis today will push millions of people into unemployment and fuel instability and violence around the world. Many will seek jobs abroad, potentially overwhelming border-control and immigration systems in Europe and North America. Another costly migration crisis will divert attention away from the urgent need to address climate change.

Through war, insurrection, chaos and intervention, it always prevailed. It remains a country of contrasting realities, but it is steadily becoming a place where dreams died. Beirut long ago lost its claim to be the Levantine equivalent of Paris. Its vibrant nightlife has been dulled by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/30/candlelight-lebanon-economic-crisis-social-catastrophe">an economic implosion</a>, its skyline disappears into darkness as we drive to my hotel at night.</p><p>With the power grid functioning only two to four hours a day, there are no traffic lights to guide us.
