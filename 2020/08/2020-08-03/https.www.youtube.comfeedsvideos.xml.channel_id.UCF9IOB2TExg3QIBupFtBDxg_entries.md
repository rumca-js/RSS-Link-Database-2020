Crucial for all parts of the country to follow safety precautions, 

Special warnings for multigenerational households

Assume you are positive if there is an outbreak in your area

Urging states with high numbers to virtual school

House parties, superspreading events rather than superspreading individuals

These need to stop

Liverpool

Local plan much more likely to succeed than nationally imposed measures

Matt Ashton, director of public health for Liverpool,

Multi-generational transmission

Enhanced outbreak control action plan

Princes Park

Community volunteers are going door to door

Raise awareness of testing availability and to promote key public health messages

Pop-up walk-in test centre is also available.

Suspension of gatherings and events in the area

Continued closure of community buildings

Shielding continued

Prevent more draconian lockdown

I think trust is a massive issue here. I just don’t think we have trust in the national system for people to tell us what we need to do. 

Therefore we are much more likely to have success if we lead this locally, if we use our community champions and leaders, our faith leaders and our volunteers, and use people who actually understand the area, live and work in the area and get the message across that way.

Response from the community to the new measures has been “phenomenal”
