In that session, hosted by Mary Lucia, Patterson described how much music allows her to connect with the people in the audience. \"I'm not doing this because we make a lot of money doing it, because we don't,\" Patterson said. \"The people that do this and really do it passionately do it because that's what is in their heart to do. That's certainly true for me.\"\nIn March of this year, Patterson released her latest album, \"There Will Come Soft Rains.\" More recently, her new song, \"Let's Grow,\" was featured on KUTX's Song Confessional \"Love in Quarantine\" podcast.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"No River\"\n3:08 \"Wantin' Ain't Gettin'\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nEsme Patterson \u2013 vocals, guitar\nPhilippe Bronchtein \u2013 guitar; piano\nJeremy Averitt \u2013 bass\nCameron Runyan \u2013 drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/08/02/esme-patterson-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2016 Guitar Collection interview: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/08/09/the-currents-guitar-collection-esme-patterson-esp-ronnie-wood-model\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inZ9Z6vqHLU", "date_published": "2020-08-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
