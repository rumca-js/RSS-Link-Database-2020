Call of Duty Season 5 is coming to Modern Warfare and Warzone on August 5, and it's bringing a host of new content to the two games. We're still waiting for the full patch notes to be released, but we've gotten a good look at the main additions.

Warzone's map is expanding, with the stadium opening and the freight train beginning to loop around Verdansk. Meanwhile, Modern Warfare is getting four new maps: Suldal Harbor, Petrov Oil Rig, Livestock, and Verdansk International Airport--a piece of the Warzone map being imported into Modern Warfare's Ground War mode. Suldal Harbor, meanwhile, is a remake of the very first Call of Duty game's Harbor map.

As you might expect, the Season 5 update is big, clocking in between 34 and 54 GB depending on your platform. Tony goes into all these details in the video above.

The Wii U is Nintendo’s greatest console failure, but, in hindsight, was a fortuitous misstep that led to one of its greatest achievements.

The Wii U is Nintendo’s greatest console failure, but, in hindsight, was a fortuitous misstep that led to one of its greatest achievements: the Switch.

Join Kurt Indovina for this episode of Remember When as he looks back on how Nintendo went from making one of the most accessible and successful video game consoles ever made, the Wii, to completely squandering its success with the Wii U.

From the confusing announcement, to Nintendo’s pivot to the Switch, Kurt seeks insight from CNET editor Jeff Bakalar, and GameSpot’s very own Miranda Church, Michael Higham, and Tamoor Hussain, to help make sense of the motivations that led to the Wii U and how it all went wrong.

Spider-Man is coming to Marvel's Avengers post-launch in 2021 as a PS4 & PS5 exclusive, PS4 controllers won't completely work on PS5 consoles, Xbox is getting a new store.

Spider-Man is coming to Marvel's Avengers post-launch in 2021 as a PS4 & PS5 exclusive. Considering Sony's ownership rights over the character, and Insomniac's PlayStation exclusive Spidey game, this probably isn't a surprise. PS4 controllers will work with PS5 consoles, but not with PS5 games. Sony stated on the PlayStation Blog that PS5 games should take full control of the DualSense. Xbox is getting a new store, rebuilt to focus on loading screens and ease of use.
