Atlantic Diving Supply Inc might sound like a mom and pop shop, but it's anything but... It is a multi-billion dollar revenue mammoth of a company that insists that it is still a small business. But not all is as it seems... despite claiming to have less than 500 employees, others have challenged this in court and won $16 million and $20 million settlements from ADS.

PPP Chronicles #2 Today we investigate David Staveley who reportedly faked his own death in order to prevent going to jail after being arrested for PPP loan fraud. He was out on bail when he cut off his GPS and ran away, ditched his car at a beach with a note. Cops almost immediately discovered the ruse and caught him. Interestingly though David Staveley, actually Kurt Sanborn, has a history with bank fraud and other horrendous acts
