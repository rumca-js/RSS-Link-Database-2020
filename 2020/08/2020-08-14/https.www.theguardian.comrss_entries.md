<p>Russia is not the only country pursuing domestic politics over global cooperation in the fight against coronavirus</p><p>We’re all waiting for a coronavirus vaccine, but when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/11/russia-coronavirus-vaccine-will-it-work-is-it-safe-sputnik-v">Russia announced</a> earlier this week that it would be the first country to approve one, nobody rejoiced. Scientists pointed out clinical testing wasn’t complete, the vaccine had been tested on fewer than 100 people. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he had “serious doubts” it would work. It was a transparent and potentially dangerous PR stunt. “It’s ridiculous,” the head of Russia’s Association of Clinical Research Organizations <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/08/russia-s-approval-covid-19-vaccine-less-meets-press-release">told the magazine Science</a><em>, </em>“I feel only shame for our country”.</p><p>The mysterious vaccine may turn out not to be dangerous. The technology is similar to several approved vaccines, and Russia has said its release will be limited to healthcare workers and other at-risk populations until further trials are completed. China similarly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-vaccine/cansinos-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-approved-for-military-use-in-china-idUSKBN2400DZ">approved</a> an in-trial vaccine for military use with essentially no fanfare. But it’s unlikely to work – most vaccines don’t. The point for Russia appears to be to pass off a limited-release in-trial vaccine as completed in order to score a little nationalistic dopamine hit. (The project is even named <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/11/russia-approves-coronavirus-vaccine-despite-testing-safety-concerns-vladimir-putin">Sputnik V</a>, suggesting it is a successor to the Soviet rockets that bested the US in the space race.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/14/vaccine-nationalism-stands-in-the-way-of-an-end-to-the-covid-19-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

This seems to have been the gateway drug to the lives of other people’s children, with an entire A-level generation the latest batch of youngsters to experience the Williamson effect.</p><p>Gavin is now Boris Johnson’s education secretary – because really, why not? – and his handling of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/13/equalities-body-warns-it-may-step-in-after-a-level-downgrades-in-england">pandemic year’s A-level results</a> has been a disasterclass even by his own standards. On the one hand, gotta feel for him. He’s had a mere five months’ notice that students would not be sitting their exams and to come up with ways of handling the situation as fairly and accessibly as possible. On the other, the upshot is such a demonstrable shambles that the prime minister has felt moved to come out and call the grade system “robust” and “dependable”. As bad as all that, then. You’ve heard of the Kitemark – any Johnson imprimatur is the guaranteed shitemark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/14/welcome-to-gavin-williamsons-disasterclass-where-incompetence-is-core-curriculum">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This novel about twin sisters shows how potent an influence religion has been on the imagination of the quintessential gay writer of our time <br /></p><p>In his landmark 1982 novel <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/10/edmund-white-a-boys-own-story-rereading-gay-literature">A Boy’s Own Story</a></em>, Edmund White wondered: “What if I could write about my life exactly as it was? What if I could show it in all its density and tedium and its concealed passion?” It seems now a self-consciously prescient remark, setting out his stall as a writer; in his long career White has crafted novels and memoirs of intense beauty and passion out of the raw experience of life.</p><p>He had already written a few books, including a debut novel the hard-to-please Vladimir Nabokov thought was “marvellous” and a 70s gay sex manual that is still in circulation, but it was <em>A Boy’s Own Story </em>that really inaugurated White’s literary project. It was the first in a series of autobiographical works in which his alter ego came of age in the homophobic midwest, joined New York’s gay underground, became a fixture in the salons of Paris and survived the traumatic Aids crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/14/a-saint-from-texas-by-edmund-white-review-sex-and-spirituality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Drawing on the original children’s story for his new live-action version, the Gomorrah director combines sentimentality and the grotesque in a unique way </p><p>There is something rich and strange and generous in Matteo Garrone’s new live-action version of the Pinocchio story, for which the director and his co-screenwriter Massimo Ceccherini have gone right back to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/jun/07/carlo-collodi-pinocchio-pipi-the-pink-monkey-alessandro-gallenzi-axel-scheffler">the original 1883 children’s tale by Carlo Collodi</a>. They have given us a story that combines sentimentality and grotesqueness in a really startling way. It looks like a horror film. This Pinocchio could almost have one of the stories that Garrone dramatised in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/17/tale-of-tales-review-matteo-garrone-salam-hayek-john-c-reilly-toby-jones">his freaky-fabular movie Tale of Tales</a>, and the story is very different from the legendary 1940 Disney musical version – without which no one would care about any new remake or reinvention.</p><p>Walt Disney, for example, never had Pinocchio being brutally hanged from a tree by two swindlers who wanted to rob him. But one of the interesting things about this drama is that Pinocchio – the magical wooden puppet who yearns to be a “real boy” – gains this authentic humanness by being exploited, by suffering and finally getting reborn with skin and hair. In a stable, as it happens.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/14/pinocchio-review-matteo-garrone-live-action">Continue reading...</a>
