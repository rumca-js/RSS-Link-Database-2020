blood donors\n\n(KEMRI, Wellcome, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine)\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.27.20162693v1.full.pdf\n\nMethods \n\nMeasured IgG prevalence\n\nBlood samples from April 30 to June 16, 2020\n\nAccount was taken of the non-random sampling\n\nResults \n\nComplete data were available for 3,098 donors\n\nAged 15-64 years\n\nCrude overall seroprevalence was 5.6%\n\nPopulation-weighted, test - adjusted national seroprevalence was 5.2%\n\nSeroprevalence was highest in the 3 largest urban Counties - Mombasa, Nairobi, Kisumu\n\nKenya, population 52m (2.7m infections)\n\nConclusions \n\nEstimate that 1 in 20 adults in Kenya had SARS-CoV-2 antibodies during the study period\n\nMedian date of the survey\n\nCases, 2093\n\nDeaths, 71 (IFR = 0.0026)\n\nHospitals not reporting many COVID admissions\n\nSeveral orders of magnitude difference\n\nHigh SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in health care workers but relatively low numbers of deaths in urban Malawi (Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome)\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.30.20164970v2.full.pdf\n\nBackground\n\nIn low-income countries\n\nPublic health measures difficult\n\nSocioeconomic constraints\n\nTherefore, potential rapid and severe pandemic\n\nPicture so far difficult to access, low testing levels\n\nSARS-CoV-2 serosurvey among health care workers in Blantyre\n\nEstimate the cumulative incidence\n\nMethods\n\n500 otherwise asymptomatic HCWs from Blantyre\n\n22 May 2020 to 19 June 2020 \n\nSerum samples were collected from all 500\n\nResults\n\nEighty four participants tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies\n\nWho were from different parts of the city\n\n12.3 %\n\nSuggesting that local transmission was high and that virus may have been circulating for some time in Blantyre\n\nUsing age - stratified infection fatality estimates reported from elsewhere;\n\nThere should have been eight times the number of reported deaths.\n\nReported number of deaths in Blantyre at the time = 17\n\nMalawi, predicted 5,295 deaths, but 51 reported\n\nConclusions\n\nHigh seroprevalence\n\nDiscrepancy in the predicted versus reported deaths\n\nEarly exposure but slow progression of COVID-19 epidemic in urban

reports from Doctors Without Borders\n\nExplanations\n\nAfrica misses many more cases due to reduced antigen testing\n\nE.g. Kenya testing about 10% Spain or Canada\n\nNigeria, testing about 2% that of Spain or Canada\n\nKenya does not have an overall rise in mortality\n\nSouth Africa, excess natural deaths, 4 times COVID death figures\nhttps://www.samrc.ac.za/sites/default/files/files/2020-08-05/weekly28July2020.pdf\n\nMedian ages\n\nSpain = 45\n\nItaly = 47\n\nUK = 40.5\n\nKenya = 20\n\nMalawi = 18\n\n(Africa number may go higher with more rural spread)\n\n? Africans have had more exposure to other coronaviruses\n\n? Regular exposure to malaria or other infectious diseases\n\n? Genetic factors protect the Kenyan population from severe disease.\n\nResearch Institute for Development, (France)\n\nhttps://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-2-global-serologic-study-for-covid-19\n\nWill test thousands for antibodies in Guinea, Senegal, Benin, Ghana, Cameroon, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo\n\nOctober\n\nImplications\n\n\u201cherd immunity\u201d \n\nShielding", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQcS-UWBq4Q", "date_published": "2020-08-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
