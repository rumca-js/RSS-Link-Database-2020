Since the launch of Season 5, Call of Duty: Warzone has been riddled with several graphical glitches and bugs. Everything from bizarre player and gun textures, to the map barely loading in at all. Not to mention the rampant hackers with aimbots and clipping abilities. Still, the Warzone community carries on and trudges through another week before any hotfixes are released. In this video Richie goes over 5 glitchy moments of the week.

In our first clip from Krushed Muffins, we see what Verdansk looks like with about 50% of the map loaded in. Instead of getting booted, Muffinz is able to not only proceed, but land on the train with his squad- and even pick up a weapon. Unfortunately the gun he finds has a weird glitched scope that doesn’t allow him to see who or what he’s shooting at. Next up is a clip from Reddit user leggoMUHeggo36. He finds an enemy player and takes a shot using his RPG. While it looks like he made contact, the enemy in question suddenly disappears! Leggo doesn’t get awarded a kill, and the enemy is never seen again.

At number 3, we have iComshot’s clip of a strange new...operator? After being hunted down, iComshot sees his opponent face to face and discovers a graphical mess of a glitch. This is a common glitch for players and weapons, and normally makes the game unplayable, but somehow, this enemy still came out on top. Number 2 comes to us from Urbanpod on Reddit. After deploying from the Warzone plane, Urban lands without a weapon. Even stranger is when he suddenly gets sent to the gulag for seemingly no reason at all! Our final spot on the list goes to Heade from Youtube. After facing off against a hacking team, Heade’s squad wins by the skin of their teeth with a hail Mary C4 explosive. The team takes the victory and the lobby afterwards is excited to say the least.

If you're looking forward to the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 then you'll want to know about one of the franchise's biggest players, the megacorp Arasaka. The Japanese corporation has played a pivotal part in some of the most important stories in the world of Cyberpunk, and CD Projekt Red's game is no exception. In fact the game is looking like it's going to tackle a few characters and plotlines the pen-and-paper game has been building for decades.

In this video you'll learn everything you need to know about Arasaka. What started as a simple manufacturing company became a far more nefarious entity under the leadership of Saburo Arasaka, who secretly plots for world domination. They've shaped the world of Cyberpunk in many ways, including their role in the devastating Fourth Corporate War and detonation of a nuclear device in Night City.

We have several more videos that deep dive into the locations and legends of the world of Cyberpunk, including a history of Night City and the rise and disappearance of Rockerboy Johnny Silverhand.

In today's gaming news, Fortnite developer Epic Games is suing Apple after Fortnite was removed from the App Store. Apple claims Epic violated App Store guidelines after introducing a new way to buy cheaper V-bucks, directly bypassing the App Store fee. 

The director of Spider-Man: Miles Morales has clarified that the game is going to be a complete standalone story when it launches later this year for PlayStation 5. 

And finally, Rockstar has rolled back their latest Red Dead Online update after it caused game-breaking bugs. While you're here, check out GameSpot's merch store.  Until the end of August, all the proceeds will go to charity, split between Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 direct relief.

## Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Warehouse Comparison

Check out our side-by-side comparison of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater's Warehouse, 1999 versus 2020.

It's been 21 years since the release of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, and now the game is returning to modern consoles with the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 remake. The first game received a demo ahead of release featuring the iconic opening Warehouse level, and now history has repeated itself, with the newly upgraded Warehouse being made available to customers who digitally pre-ordered the remake or scored a code from Chipotle.

As you'll see in the video above, the map has received a full visual upgrade, while still staying largely the same as you'll remember it, with the same ramps, gaps, and rails you could skate back in 1999. It was a great level design back then, and it remains great now.

While the game will features an updated trick-list that lets you pull off moves from the sequels, including reverts, spine transfers, and fancy flatland tricks, in the video above we're playing with an in-game controller mod called "Classic THPS1". This disables any moves added from THPS2 onwards, including the manual, and makes for an authentic recreation of the first game. Other mods are included in the demo, letting you turn off bails, enable perfect balance for grinds, manuals, and lip tricks, or have your Special meter constantly full.

The demo is a blast of nostalgia, and has us more excited to revisit the Birdman's video game origins again. If you've pre-ordered, you'll be able to play the demo yourself from 8 AM PT on August 14.
