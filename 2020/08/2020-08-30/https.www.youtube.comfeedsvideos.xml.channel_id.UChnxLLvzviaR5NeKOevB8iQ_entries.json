They're both excellent, but what makes them different? Let's find out.\n\nSubscribe to my ambient channel for nothing but... uh... ambient: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG44gzf6Iumy18XEZXT2odA\n\nGet my modular album and donate to a good cause: https://soundvision.bandcamp.com/album/adams-fault\n\nHere are some differences I missed!\n* Plaits shares no hardware or software with Braids!\n* Floating-point DSP code written from scratch or inherited from Elements, Warps and Rings.\n* Band-limited synthesis used almost everywhere, producing aliasing-free results at the base sample rate of 48kHz (Braids ran at 96kHz and used naive oversampling).\n* High-quality Sigma-Delta ADC for CV acquisition, approaching a resolution of 16-bit (12-bit for Braids).\n* ADC reads are interpolated in software to eliminate zipper noise.\n* DC-coupled audio output, extending the range of the module to very low frequencies (Braids could not reach LFO ranges).\n* Lean hardware design: less HP, mA and \u20ac\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1mKPH8FqzM", "date_published": "2020-08-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
