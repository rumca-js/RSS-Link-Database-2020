<ul><li>Tiger Woods opens with lowest first round at a major since 2012</li><li>Jason Day and Brendon Todd shoot five-under 65s </li></ul><p>There is a Tiger Woods statistic for all occasions. Some leap off the page, such as a 68 to begin the US PGA Championship being Woods’s lowest first round at a major since the Open Championship of 2012. For his 15 major triumphs, Woods has been sub-70 on only seven Thursdays. Yet it somehow felt even more noteworthy that Woods used Harding Park and golf’s long-awaited return in this, its most high-profile form, to outscore his playing partners.</p><p>In Rory McIlroy and Justin Thomas, Woods was alongside a player for whom this venue looks tailor-made and the recently-appointed world No 1. McIlroy struggled for driving accuracy during a level-par 70 while Thomas slipped to a 71. It would be folly to discount either from this tournament – as Woods knows only too well – but the old master rising to the occasion after the buildup of only a single, disappointing post-lockdown event turned heads.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/06/tiger-woods-in-control-and-outshines-wayward-rory-mcilroy-at-us-pga">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anonymity for rape suspects makes it even harder to get justice, especially when the legal system moves so slowly</p><p>If you’re a woman, would you feel comfortable getting into a lift, alone, with a man accused of sexual assault? How about waiting for a taxi together late at night, or even discussing something personal in a meeting? If you’re a man, would you avoid friendly chitchat with someone who may or may not be guilty, or go out of your way to show that everyone is innocent until proven otherwise?</p><p>For more than two years, almost everyone in professional contact with the former Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke must have wrestled with dilemmas like these, and this week’s revelation that a second unnamed Tory MP has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/01/former-minister-arrested-sexual-assault-charge">accused of rape</a> means some will shortly be wrestling with them again. Elphicke was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/nov/03/tory-mp-charlie-elphicke-has-whip-suspended-after-serious-allegations">referred to the police</a> in November 2017 over allegations of sexual assault but wasn’t even charged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/22/tory-mp-charlie-elphicke-charged-with-sexual-assault">until July 2019</a>, and then it was another year before a jury finally found him guilty. The longer things dragged on, the more boldly he could protest his innocence. After all, if there really was anything to it, wouldn’t he be in the dock by now? He presented himself indignantly as the subject of a kangaroo court, persuading other MPs to lobby for him at the highest levels; even Boris Johnson was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/03/cabinet-minister-lobbied-boris-johnson-help-charlie-elphicke">reportedly pressed</a> to “do something to help Charlie”.

But in reality he was simply experiencing a criminal justice system where tortuous delays in reaching court are routine, and mostly pass beneath the radar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/06/political-culture-sexual-assault-convictions-justice-westminster">Continue reading...</a>

## The Book in the Cathedral by Christopher de Hamel review – adventures of a manuscript sleuth

<p>A brilliant manuscript scholar delves into the mystery of Thomas Becket’s jewelled book of psalms</p><p>On Christmas Day 1170, Thomas Becket delivered a sermon to a packed chapter house at Canterbury. His theme was the death of one his predecessors as archbishop, St Alphege, hacked to death by the Danes in the early 11th century – the only martyr in the role so far. “There will soon be another,” Becket declared. Four days later, a quartet of knights arrived drunk, on a perceived mission from the king, and dashed the archbishop’s brains across the cathedral floor. It is easy to see how, knowing his time was up, Becket might identify with Alphege. In <em>The Book in the Cathedral</em>, however, Christopher de Hamel argues that the two had something more tangible in common: an elaborately jewelled psalter – a book of psalms – once owned by Alphege and later treasured by Becket.</p><p>The cult that sprang up around Becket after his death spread widely and swiftly. Within three years he was Saint Thomas, and Canterbury would become one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in Europe. When the Reformation came, however, Becket fell out of favour, his relics – bones, clothes, a soiled handkerchief – destroyed as the baggage of an old form of superstition. One curious quirk of relic veneration is that books rarely make the cut. Becket’s library then, shelved unassumingly in a passageway in the cathedral, was spared the reformers’ zeal. Instead it was cherrypicked by Matthew Parker, archbishop to Elizabeth I, who in turn left his own library to his former college at Cambridge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/06/the-book-in-the-cathedral-by-christopher-de-hamel-review-adventures-of-a-manuscript-sleuth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Defender on how Bayern found their joy again, German’s young talent, facing Chelsea and why he could return to England one day</p><p>“There were hard times,” Jérôme Boateng says as his mind drifts back to Bayern Munich’s wobbles at the start of the season. “It’s like being a child. As a child if I had no confidence, if you don’t get trust from your friends, then you lose the joy of the game. That’s what happens now, even when I’m older.”</p><p>Boateng, one of the finest defenders of his generation, could feel the spark ebbing away. Bayern were on the slide under Niko Kovac, a coach struggling to connect with a champion squad, and time finally appeared to have caught up with the old guard. Thomas Müller and Manuel Neuer were under pressure and Boateng, aware that people were starting to view him as a fading force, wondered whether a change of scenery was required.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/06/jerome-boateng-premier-league-bayern-munich-chelsea-young-talent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The flavours of fenugreek and cinnamon complement the peanuts, with wholegrains and fruit thrown in for a healthy mix</p><p>A biscuit, generally speaking, is a combination of fat and sugar with a sprinkling of carbs in the mix. The big challenge is figuring out how to make something a little healthier. Here, I have replaced some of that fat and sugar content with wholegrains, nuts and fruit.</p><p>I love coming up with new flavour combinations. Sometimes, I opt for contrasting flavours to create a balance that sings, like sweet and sour. Other times, as in this peanut butter sandwich number, I plump instead for complementary flavours to achieve a warm homogeneity. This pairing of fenugreek and cinnamon with the peanuts does exactly that.

<p>A novel of philosophical and creative inquiry, cleverly plotted and packed with great characters</p><p>When Jan Vidor, the narrator of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/17/meet-the-author-valerie-martin-interview-sea-lovers-property">Valerie Martin</a>’s immensely satisfying new novel, arrives at the grand Villa Chiara near Siena in the summer of 1983, she knows nothing of its history, and little of its aristocratic owners: she is looking for a quiet place to research a new book she is planning, to be set in the era of Mussolini, and has no intention of being sidetracked by curiosity. But that, as any writer who has visited Italy on a deadline could have told her, is easier said than done.</p><p>A novelist and an academic at an American university, Jan is thus far a safe bet as avatar for the prizewinning Martin herself – though this assumption, as so many in this beautifully fractal novel, is challenged and unpicked as the narrative progresses. Jan knows only the name of a fellow academic, the glamorous fiftysomething Beatrice Salviati, from whom she is renting the Villa Chiara’s orangery. From her terrace in the <em>limonaia</em>, with “access to scenes no one else saw”, Jan is both on the edge of things and screened from view: the ideal novelist’s vantage point. She cannot stop herself from making notes, not on Mussolini but on her setting: the meals, the landscape, “the sweet sound of doves cooing”, the great house she overlooks and most importantly the comings, goings and secretive doings of the Salviati family.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/06/i-give-it-to-you-by-valerie-martin-review-an-italian-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The demise of the shopping catalogue has prompted mass nostalgia. But its closure after almost 50 years shows how our buying habits have changed – and how obsessed we now are with screens<br /></p><p>How much do people in England love Argos? The answer comes from a surprising source: information concerning the riots that swept the country in the summer of 2011. When rioters fancied chucking a brick through a shop window and seeing what they could walk out with, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/datablog/2011/dec/06/england-riots-shops-raided#:~:text=It%20shows%20that%20Argos%20was,be%20up%20to%20%C2%A3300m.">Argos’s premises were </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/datablog/2011/dec/06/england-riots-shops-raided#:~:text=It%20shows%20that%20Argos%20was,be%20up%20to%20%C2%A3300m.">the most commonly targeted</a>. More people wanted to steal stuff from Argos than anywhere else.</p><p>That is not something about which Argos boasts – most-looted shop in England, 2011! – but it is a measure of how British people perceive Argos: the place that has everything (even if, in reality, the shops have only things that will sell immediately, or stuff that has been ordered for collection by customers). Why do we think Argos has everything? Because of its catalogue, “The Book of Dreams”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/06/the-argos-catalogue-why-britains-love-affair-with-the-book-of-dreams-had-to-end">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A traditionally hostile match-up is shaping up to be a little warmer thanks to the tourists answering the ECB’s call</p><p>A friend asked what hooliganism, depression, rickets and economic stagnation have in common. His answer was that at different times they have all been known overseas as “the English disease”. The odd thing was that superciliousness wasn’t among them, too. The first time Pakistan came to play in Britain, their players were surprised to find that a lot of English people didn’t even know their country existed. The team didn’t bring an official scorer or a single radio or newspaper journalist, but were accompanied by an official from the Pakistan High Commission, whose job it was to tell the people they met exactly which nation they were there representing.</p><p>This was in 1954, seven years after partition. It was a wet summer, and the first and third Tests were washed out. In between, England won the second by an innings and 129 runs. “To say the plain truth the Pakistani team could scarcely hold its own in the English county cricket championship,” wrote Neville Cardus afterwards. In the Guardian, Denys Rowbotham reckoned this was too generous. He said Pakistan were “scarcely minor counties standard”. In the fourth and final Test, Fazal Mahmood took 12 for 99, England were bowled out for 130 and 143, and Pakistan won by 24 runs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/06/pakistan-bubble-sacrifices-smooth-edge-england-rivalry-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An unusual addition to the franchise refreshingly unshackles itself from the mothership, yet it can’t quite beam its way to anywhere distinctive </p><p>Despite being set in the same universe as Gene Roddenberry’s landmark series and its myriad film and television offshoots, Star Trek: Lower Decks, an innocuous new animated series about a crew of up-and-coming Starfleet crew members, never leans on its own mythology. The lead characters are young goofballs who work on the crew of the USS Cerritos, a ship specializing in “second contact”, which means they visit new planets after the A-team has already done the more prestigious work. Their jobs are routine and bureaucratic. They usually involve paperwork. None of the characters resemble Captain Kirk or Mr Spock, mentioned here only in passing and usually as the butt of a joke. Instead, Lower Decks smartly creates new, original characters who are funny, relatable, and fully independent of their source material. If Star Trek weren’t in the title, you might not even notice the similarities.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/31/muppets-now-review-disney-reboot-boasts-wit-warmth-and-charm">Muppets Now review – Disney+ reboot boasts wit, warmth and charm</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/06/star-trek-lower-decks-review-animated">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m yearning to go to Greece, but in the absence of effective UK government policy, there are no clear choices</p><p>On social media, the holiday photos have started again. They are more muted now, not so brash and boastful. More tasteful views of the sea, less infinity pool luxury.

Like many others, I have been walking the same streets since March, but I’ve been dreaming of the Greek sea. I miss its particular clarity; shades of glittering aquamarine. Salt on my lips washed off with delicious cheap, thin white wine. Last year, I was there, reading Emily Wilson’s translation of the Odyssey as I watched fishermen shell prawns on the harbour front. It feels like a hallucination, now.</p><p>Holidays are a luxury. As with gardens, the pandemic has demarcated the haves and the have-nots.

<p>The chancellor did the right things in March but has done precious little since. From this week, his safety net unravels</p><p>For a hint of what the near future of this country holds, talk to Emily Pringle. At the end of June, she advertised a job with her home-fragrance firm, Notes of Northumberland. Based in pretty Alnwick, with lovely colleagues – 16 hours a week, working mainly in the shop. Pringle might ordinarily expect 40-odd CVs. This time, she was deluged: within a fortnight, almost 600 people applied.<br /><br />Many lived more than 30 miles away, in Newcastle. Most were vastly overqualified, and a good number had PhDs. All were now fighting for part-time work in retail. “It made me sad,” Pringle tells me. “That’s not why they spent so long studying. But it says a lot about the state of the jobs market.”<br /><br />Look around and these stories are unfolding all over Covid UK. A Manchester restaurant wants a receptionist: over the next 24 hours, <a href="https://www.thecaterer.com/news/manchester-20-stories-job-applications">almost 1,000 people write in</a>. A south London pub seeks two bar staff: <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/nearly-500-people-apply-two-pub-jobs-alexandra-wimbledon-a4502711.html">500 candidates step forward</a>.</p><p>Shocking numbers, for now. But by Christmas such vignettes will be piled higher than the snow because, if the official projections are correct, the UK faces a<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/14/weak-recovery-could-take-unemployment-to-1980s-levels-warns-obr"> jobs crisis</a> the likes of which it hasn’t confronted for two generations.

<p>When he arrived in the UK in 1952, he faced vicious racism – and decided to fight back. In the first of a new series, he tells the story of the Bristol boycott</p><p>One day in early 1963, Roy Hackett was walking in Broadmead, Bristol, when he saw a man crying. The man was outside the Bristol Omnibus Company. He told Hackett he was weeping because the company had told him he could not get an interview for a job there solely because he was black. Almost 60 years later, and despite all he has seen in his 92 years, it still sticks in Hackett’s throat – “not because he was a Jamaican, or foreign, but because he was <em>black</em>. It is degrading.”</p><p>Hackett marched straight into the bus company to demand answers. He was, he says, “born an activist” and saw it as his duty to challenge racism whenever he saw it. Once in front of the manager, he made it clear he was not asking for black people to be treated equally – he was demanding it. The indignation and strength of his will ring in his voice as he remembers telling the boss: “If he can’t drive it, then the bus won’t be moving, will it?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/06/roy-hackett-the-civil-rights-hero-who-stood-in-front-of-a-bus-and-changed-britain-for-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A funeral, a family, and a journey into a disappearing religion. By Shaun Walker <br /></p><p>My grandfather had never been a tall man, and now he looked absurdly small, no bigger than a child. Swaddled in off-white sheets like a newborn, with just his head and the soles of his feet visible, his eyes were open and mouth disconcertingly agape, as if in surprise. His corpse was slightly raised from the floor, lain atop a rickety wooden stretcher. Beside the body, three priests in white robes intoned in Avestan, the long-dead language of the Zoroastrian scriptures, as a small fire burned in a silver urn in front of them.</p><p>It was the height of Mumbai’s monsoon season, and the air in the prayer pavilion was heavy with moisture. The occasional cloudburst outside provided no respite from heat or humidity, and the priests cooled themselves with handheld fans that resembled ping-pong bats as they repeated their sonorous chants. The funeral was the first time I had heard Zoroastrian prayers spoken out loud, though I remembered my grandfather over the years murmuring them under his breath multiple times a day, velvet cap on his head and prayer book in his hand. Besides my mother and me, the small group in attendance was mainly made up of frail friends and distant relatives, almost all of them Parsis, as the Zoroastrians of India are known.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/06/last-of-the-zoroastrians-parsis-mumbai-india-ancient-religion">Continue reading...</a>
