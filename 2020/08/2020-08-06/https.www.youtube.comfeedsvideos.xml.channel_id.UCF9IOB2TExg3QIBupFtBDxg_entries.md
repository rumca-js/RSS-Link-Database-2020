Have you had COVID-19 without knowing? (King’s College)

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20162701v1

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-antibodies

New study reveals at least one in five people infected don't show any symptoms

London and the South East of England

Community not hospital

Antibody testing on blood samples from 432 adults

12% (51) of those tested were positive for COVID antibodies

19% (9) asymptomatic

But may still be infectious

27% (16) who had antibodies and experienced symptoms didn’t have the 3 core NHS symptoms

Persistent cough

Fever

Anosmia

Specificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%

Compared to 88% for fever, cough and anosmia combined

However, loss of smell alone was still highly specific for having COVID-19, compared with the combination of all three symptoms

Additionally

Around half of the app users who reported symptoms that were highly predictive of COVID-19 did not have antibodies

Confirming other studies showing that current antibody testing misses a substantial fraction of cases
  
Not made, or fade quickly

Looking into T cells

A significant proportion of the population in London and the South East are likely to have been exposed to coronavirus

Many of them without showing any symptoms at all
 
It’s essential that we all take steps to protect the health of everyone by sticking to social distancing guidelines, wearing face coverings in public and following good hand hygiene practices

So if you have symptoms you can’t explain - get a swab or saliva test

Protect yourself and the people around you

These results suggest that both swab and antibody testing significantly underestimate the extent of coronavirus infections in the population


New AI diagnostic can predict COVID-19 likelihood without a test

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2

Model is able to predict COVID-19 infection without patients having to be tested

By comparing them with people who have used the app to share their symptoms and the results of traditional COVID tests

Have great promise for populations where access to testing is limited

n = 2,618,862

18,401 had a SARS-CoV-2 test

7,178 of these came back positive

COVID-19 type symptoms most likely to be associated with a positive test

Wide range of symptoms caused by COVID compared to cold and flu

Danger of focusing only on fever and cough

Anosmia

Present in 66% of people testing positive
Present in 21 % of those testing negative 

Anosmia is a stronger predictor of COVID-19 than fever

Mathematical model

Predicted with nearly 80% accuracy whether an individual is likely to have COVID-19 based on;
Age
Sex
A combination of four key symptoms: loss of smell or taste, severe or persistent cough, fatigue and skipping meals

Unwell app users

800, 000 app users unwell

17.42% were likely to have COVID-19 at that time 

Prospective trials now underway

Jonathan Wolf
These initial results suggest that artificial intelligence diagnosis can help significantly without controversial privacy trade-offs

Professor Tim Spector
Our results suggest that loss of taste or smell is a key early warning sign of COVID-19 infection and should be included in routine screening for the disease

We strongly urge governments and health authorities everywhere to make this information more widely known

Advise anyone experiencing sudden loss of smell or taste to assume that they are infected and follow local self-isolation guidelines

Chief executive Adrian Phillips

We are not waiting for some Government announcement

We know our rates are increasing and they have increased over the last week to a level now where we are concerned that we could face Government intervention

Get tested even with mild symptoms.
