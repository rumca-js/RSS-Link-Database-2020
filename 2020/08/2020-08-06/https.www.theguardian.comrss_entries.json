His theme was the death of one his predecessors as archbishop, St Alphege, hacked to death by the Danes in the early 11th century \u2013 the only martyr in the role so far. \u201cThere will soon be another,\u201d Becket declared. Four days later, a quartet of knights arrived drunk, on a perceived mission from the king, and dashed the archbishop\u2019s brains across the cathedral floor. It is easy to see how, knowing his time was up, Becket might identify with Alphege. In <em>The Book in the Cathedral</em>, however, Christopher de Hamel argues that the two had something more tangible in common: an elaborately jewelled psalter \u2013 a book of psalms \u2013 once owned by Alphege and later treasured by Becket.</p><p>The cult that sprang up around Becket after his death spread widely and swiftly. Within three years he was Saint Thomas, and Canterbury would become one of the most visited pilgrimage sites in Europe. When the Reformation came, however, Becket fell out of favour, his relics \u2013 bones, clothes, a soiled handkerchief \u2013 destroyed as the baggage of an old form of superstition. One curious quirk of relic veneration is that books rarely make the cut. Becket\u2019s library then, shelved unassumingly in a passageway in the cathedral, was spared the reformers\u2019 zeal. Instead it was cherrypicked by Matthew Parker, archbishop to Elizabeth I, who in turn left his own library to his former college at Cambridge.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/06/the-book-in-the-cathedral-by-christopher-de-hamel-review-adventures-of-a-manuscript-sleuth\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/06/the-book-in-the-cathedral-by-christopher-de-hamel-review-adventures-of-a-manuscript-sleuth", "date_published": "2020-08-06 11:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng: 'I would not say no to the Premier League.
