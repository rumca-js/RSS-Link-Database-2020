Finally, Sony's State Of Play stream revealed that PSVR Support is coming to Hitman 3 when it launches early next year.

We break down the latest Apex Legends trailer, which reveals the new legend Rampart. Season 6 also adds crafting and a new weapon.

Respawn has released the first official details for Apex Legends Season 6: Boosted, and from those details we can begin to formulate a few educated guesses as to what additional content we can expect.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée details both what we know about Season 6 and what we can possibly infer about the upcoming season based on this new information. Whether or not we're right remains to be seen, though we'll find out pretty soon as Season 6 is scheduled to begin on August 18.

So far, Respawn has confirmed Season 6's new character is Rampart and its new weapon is the Volt SMG. The developer has also announced a new crafting system will be implemented in Season 6 and that the season's battle pass will include a brand-new collection of Holo-Spray items.

That's pretty much it, though. We don't know Rampart's abilities, how the Volt will behave in combat, how crafting will work, or what Holo-Sprays will look like. However, based on in-game clues and map changes, the Season 6 cinematic launch trailer, and Titanfall 2, we can make quite a few educated guesses.

## We FINALLY Understand What Kind Of Game Marvel's Avengers Is

If you happen to think that Marvel's Avengers seems an awful lot like Destiny, you'd be right! The upcoming superhero game possesses several similarities to a loot shooter in how its gameplay loop works.

In the video above, Jean-Luc Seipke details Marvel's Avengers overall gameplay loop, based on what we experienced in the game's beta. This includes the game's Reassemble campaign, co-op missions, power levelling, and character progression. There's a lot to do in Marvel's Avengers.

You'll access most of the features and missions in Marvel's Avengers via the game's hub, a helicarrier known as the Chimera. From here, you can access the War Table, which lists all of your available single-player campaign missions as well as the War Zone, Drop Zone, and HARM missions that you can tackle either on your own or in a group of up to four players. 

On the Chimera, you'll also be able to access each playable character's skill tree and gear loadout, allowing you to customize your heroes. Each character has their own battle pass-like challenge card too, along with an assortment of daily and weekly challenges that you can check on while aboard the Chimera.

Confirming rumors and in a big shakeup for the familiar formula, Microsoft recently announced that Halo Infinite’s multiplayer will be entirely free. In a new video feature, GameSpot editor Eddie Makuch explains why that may be the smartest move Microsoft has made in years for Halo, and one that could pay dividends to help the franchise grow.

In the full video, Eddie goes into detail about how Halo Infinite’s multiplayer going free should help improve the online experience and keep the playerbase connected and engaged over the years. The video also touches on some of the potential issues that may crop up, like cheating.

Be sure to check out the full video above, and you can read an even more in-depth written editorial on the subject on GameSpot to find out more.

With the lackluster reveal for the campaign mode in July, fans are right to be skeptical and hesitant about Halo Infinite’s multiplayer going free, but I’m hoping these fears are unfounded. 343 has promised to show Halo Infinite’s multiplayer “soon” and talk about its many innovations, and I can’t wait to see it. It could be the beginning of a new era for Halo.

Capcom announced five new characters are on the way for Street Fighter V's final season. Dan and Rose, last seen in Street Fighter IV, were the first to be revealed. Oro, who was last playable in Street Fighter III was the third character confirmed to be making a return. Akira Kazama from Rival Schools was announced, and she has a connection to Sakura so will fit right in among the Street Fighter crew. The fifth and final character has yet to be announced but the Season 5 Roadmap shows new stages, costumes, and more reveals will happen over the course of the next year. 

Xbox Live Gold is here to stay, after rumors suggesting it would be discontinued were clarified by Microsoft. A name change in the Xbox Services agreement was made to distinguish the difference between underlying Xbox Live Services and Xbox Live Gold. As of now, there are no plans to change Xbox Live Gold. Another Microsoft livestream is planned for this month that may contain more information on what we'll see next.
