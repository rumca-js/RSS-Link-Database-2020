(King\u2019s College)\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20162701v1\n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com/post/covid-antibodies\n\nNew study reveals at least one in five people infected don't show any symptoms\n\nLondon and the South East of England\n\nCommunity not hospital\n\nAntibody testing on blood samples from 432 adults\n\n12% (51) of those tested were positive for COVID antibodies\n\n19% (9) asymptomatic\n\nBut may still be infectious\n\n27% (16) who had antibodies and experienced symptoms didn\u2019t have the 3 core NHS symptoms\n\nPersistent cough\n\nFever\n\nAnosmia\n\nSpecificity of anosmia for seropositivity was 95%\n\nCompared to 88% for fever, cough and anosmia combined\n\nHowever, loss of smell alone was still highly specific for having COVID-19, compared with the combination of all three symptoms\n\nAdditionally\n\nAround half of the app users who reported symptoms that were highly predictive of COVID-19 did not have antibodies\n\nConfirming other studies showing that current antibody testing misses a substantial fraction of cases\n  \nNot made, or fade quickly\n\nLooking into T cells\n\nA significant proportion of the population in London and the South East are likely to have been exposed to coronavirus\n\nMany of them without showing any symptoms at all\n \nIt\u2019s essential that we all take steps to protect the health of everyone by sticking to social distancing guidelines, wearing face coverings in public and following good hand hygiene practices\n\nSo if you have symptoms you can\u2019t explain - get a swab or saliva test\n\nProtect yourself and the people around you\n\nThese results suggest that both swab and antibody testing significantly underestimate the extent of coronavirus infections in the population\n\n\nNew AI diagnostic can predict COVID-19 likelihood without a test\n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com/post/detecting-covid-without-a-test\n\nhttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0916-2\n\nModel is able to predict COVID-19 infection without patients having to be tested\n\nBy comparing them with people who have used the app to share their symptoms and the results of traditional COVID tests\n\nHave great promise for populations where access to testing is limited\n\nn = 2,618,862\n\n18,401 had a SARS-CoV-2 test\n\n7,178 of these came back positive\n\nCOVID-19 type symptoms most likely to be associated with a positive test\n\nWide range of symptoms caused by COVID compared to cold and flu\n\nDanger of focusing only on fever and cough\n\nAnosmia\n\nPresent in 66% of people testing positive\nPresent in 21 % of those testing negative \n\nAnosmia is a stronger predictor of COVID-19 than fever\n\nMathematical model\n\nPredicted with nearly 80% accuracy whether an individual is likely to have COVID-19 based on;\nAge\nSex\nA combination of four key symptoms: loss of smell or taste, severe or persistent cough, fatigue and skipping meals\n\nUnwell app users\n\n800, 000 app users unwell\n\n17.42% were likely to have COVID-19 at that time \n\nProspective trials now underway\n\nJonathan Wolf\nThese initial results suggest that artificial intelligence diagnosis can help significantly without controversial privacy trade-offs\n\nProfessor Tim Spector\nOur results suggest that loss of taste or smell is a key early warning sign of COVID-19 infection and should be included in routine screening for the disease\n\nWe strongly urge governments and health authorities everywhere to make this information more widely known\n\nAdvise anyone experiencing sudden loss of smell or taste to assume that they are infected and follow local
