Season 6 also adds crafting and a new weapon.\n\nRespawn has released the first official details for Apex Legends Season 6: Boosted, and from those details we can begin to formulate a few educated guesses as to what additional content we can expect.\n\nIn the video above, Jordan Ram\u00e9e details both what we know about Season 6 and what we can possibly infer about the upcoming season based on this new information. Whether or not we're right remains to be seen, though we'll find out pretty soon as Season 6 is scheduled to begin on August 18.\n\nSo far, Respawn has confirmed Season 6's new character is Rampart and its new weapon is the Volt SMG. The developer has also announced a new crafting system will be implemented in Season 6 and that the season's battle pass will include a brand-new collection of Holo-Spray items.\n\nThat's pretty much it, though. We don't know Rampart's abilities, how the Volt will behave in combat, how crafting will work, or what Holo-Sprays will look like. However, based on in-game clues and map changes, the Season 6 cinematic launch trailer, and Titanfall 2, we can make quite a few educated guesses.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as1YClpQG68", "date_published": "2020-08-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "DOOM Eternal \u2013 Official DLC Teaser Part 1 | 'The Ancient Gods'", "description": "Watch the first glimpse of DOOM Eternal\u2019s first campaign expansion, then see the full trailer reveal at Opening Night Live, August 27th at 2pm ET.\n\nYour victory over Hell\u2019s armies pulled humanity back from the edge of extinction, but it came at a cost.
