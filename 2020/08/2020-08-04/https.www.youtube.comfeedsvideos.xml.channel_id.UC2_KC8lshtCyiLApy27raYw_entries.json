Why do I do it? I don\u2019t know, suppose its just all those squishy pokemons give me a warm feeling in the bottom of my heart.\n\nOr not, who cares.\n\nIt\u2019s a video about pokemon mystery dungeon, and some other stuff not about pokemon mystery dungeon. Does anybody really read these descriptions? Like I know I\u2019m supposed to do them but why?\n\nI mean I leave some links to social media stuff and additional footage credits, but this whole \u201cexplain what the video is about\u201d concept is so bizarre. Like, by the time you read this you probably know what the video is about anyway, it\u2019s in the title right? \n\nwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/KnowledgeHubTy\n\nSoundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-503704039\n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theknowledgehub\n\nSecond Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-KL04Ra6E1Du0pFawN4pWg\n\nSpotify\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/3STpelEilrthF8UxsQTaaw?si=52TH_ZKTQhaKhfnK1Jomfg\n\n\nAdditional footage credits\n\nXdiabloX125\nWorld of Longplays\nVizzed Gameplay Videos\nDacothetrainer", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZUIidpmwcg", "date_published": "2020-08-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
