<p>The pragmatism of Scott Parker’s Fulham triumphed over the doomed idealism of Thomas Frank’s Brentford in a game that failed to live up to the billing</p><p>And so, ultimately, it all came down to this. A full year of toil; 120 minutes of grim application, in many cases a lifetime of longing. A free-kick in a seemingly innocuous position on the left wing. A defence maintaining an audaciously high line, a goalkeeper anxiously patrolling the space behind it and a left-back who spied an irresistible opportunity to write himself into folklore.</p><p>That, ultimately, was all it took to send Fulham back to the Premier League and leave Brentford in the Championship for another season. On one level, it felt unspeakably senseless for something this important to be settled by something this silly. But then again, here we all were, watching a terrible game at an empty Wembley Stadium in August, with fake crowd noise being piped over the airwaves and a socially-distanced national anthem at the start. Perhaps, on reflection, the ship had already sailed on that score.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/aug/05/joe-bryan-seizes-the-moment-to-grab-glory-and-crush-brentford-spirit">Continue reading...</a>

But, for Maïna Cissé, the founder of lingerie brand <a href="https://theunderargument.com/">the Underargument</a>, stories are the thing. In 2018, Cissé introduced what she calls “anticasting”, a new method to find the models for the images on her site, that could also be described as “blind”. She asks interested parties to <a href="https://theunderargument.com/pages/the-anti-casting-entry-form">submit their stories</a> based on a theme of her collections – which run from the problem of perfectionism to what a loving relationship looks like now. Based only on these written submissions – without seeing images of the women, or any measurements – she casts her next shoot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/04/you-are-more-than-a-body-the-lingerie-brand-that-picks-models-without-seeing-them">Continue reading...</a>

## Labour's Dawn Butler: 'People threatened to kill me. I’ve been attacked on the tube'

<p>Her support for Black Lives Matter forced the MP to close her office. She says ending racism is the fight of her generation – and she has no qualms about upsetting Labour’s leader</p><p>At the start of April, Dawn Butler was a well-liked figure in parliament and looked like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/labour-deputy-leader-trade-union-equality">a strong candidate for deputy leader of the Labour party</a>. An experienced parliamentarian, 50 years old and a party member for more than 30 of them, she had been a minister in Gordon Brown’s government and served in Jeremy Corbyn’s shadow cabinet. In December 2009, she had been the first black woman to speak from the dispatch box. She also had strong union links, having worked for the GMB and, before that, the Public and Commercial Services Union. She had a life before – and halfway through – Westminster, working as a computer programmer and then an employment-service trainer.</p><p>In February 2005, she stood to be a parliamentary candidate in West Ham, in the east London borough of Newham, where she was raised by her mother, who worked for the NHS, and her father, who worked on the railways. She lost that race by four votes. A month later, she went for Brent South, in north-west London, and got it, even though “it had already been earmarked for Tony Blair’s political adviser. That was like a red rag to a bull, wasn’t it? It had already been stitched up for a bloke, so obviously I was going to go for it.” That May, she won the seat in the general election.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/04/labour-dawn-butler-people-threatened-to-kill-me-ive-been-attacked-on-the-tube">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In its first year of existence, XR transformed the global conversation around the climate crisis. But then it was gripped by internal conflicts about its next steps. Can the movement reinvent itself for the post-pandemic world? By Matthew Taylor</p><p>In November 2017, Roger Hallam looked up from his cup of tea in a central London cafe and made a bold prediction. He had been walking me through the principles behind a new air pollution campaign he was organising, which involved small groups of activists blocking some of London’s busiest junctions, when he paused, mid-sentence. “Of course, this is just small-scale stuff compared to what is coming,” Hallam said. “The scale of the ecological crisis is a different thing. It is going to change everything.”</p><p>The air pollution campaign, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/27/we-dont-have-time-to-wait-and-see-air-pollution-protesters-resort-to-direct-action" title="">Stop Killing Londoners</a>, had yet to gain traction with politicians or the media, but Hallam didn’t seem too concerned. He explained that it was partly being used to “road-test” civil disobedience tactics. “Within a year or so we will have thousands of people on the streets, blocking large parts of central London for days on end,” he said. “Hundreds will be arrested and the government will be forced to sit down and tell the truth about the climate emergency.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/04/evolution-of-extinction-rebellion-climate-emergency-protest-coronavirus-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With NHS services consumed by the fight against Covid-19 in recent months, cancer care has been dealt a blow, with diagnoses and treatment delayed</p><p>When the UK went into lockdown in March, the NHS braced for what it knew would be one of the most challenging periods in its history. As wards were cleared, staff were redeployed to the fight against Covid-19 that risked overwhelming the health service. But amid the upheaval, patients with other deadly diseases had their treatments and diagnoses delayed. </p><p>The Guardian’s health policy editor, <strong>Denis Campbell</strong>,<strong> </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that the impact of coronavirus has been particularly hard on cancer care in the UK. Thousands of cases have gone undiagnosed and the backlog of appointments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/01/millions-in-uk-miss-cancer-screenings-tests-and-treatments-due-to-covid-19">exceeds 2 million</a>. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/aug/04/how-cancer-care-was-sidelined-in-the-fight-against-covid-19-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
