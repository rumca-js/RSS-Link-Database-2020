The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

August 5, 2020 | Bobby Carter - I spend a considerable amount of time in the comments section for our concerts. I'm always curious to see what the listeners think about the shows we produce. Masego fans had plenty to say about his stint at the Tiny Desk, but there was an unusual amount of praise for his guitar player: "She's nice on that guitar" ... "Everyone's talking about that girl on guitar. She's a beast" ... "Melanie Faye on guitar. What a treat. Maybe everyone didn't know her then, but they will."

I didn't know, but I quickly got in line. Only then did I realize that in addition to being a guitar virtuoso, she's an equally talented singer-songwriter. Songs like "It's A Moot Point" and "Super Sad Always" take on a deeper meaning in quarantine times, so we invited her to rock solo from her home in Nashville. The introduction for this set is dedicated to an obvious hero of hers, Jimi Hendrix, whose picture is draped above her shoulder on the wall. From there, she rolls into acoustic versions of the aforementioned tracks, along with "Eternally 12." All three songs can be heard on her upcoming self-titled EP, out Aug. 13.

SET LIST
"Super Sad Always"
"It's A Moot Point"
"Eternally 12"

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

August 4, 2020 | Bob Boilen - Like so many artists, Kate Davis was to be on tour during the spring and summer of 2020. She was scheduled to play a concert at my desk in May. Sitting by her desk at home, Kate Davis is marking time by writing new music and performs one of those new tunes, "Ride or Die," for this quarantine concert. She's an extraordinary lyricist. Her 2019 album, Trophy, was a sharply worded collection of songs, many about growing up and a powerful tune about her father's death. "Open Heart," the second song performed for her Tiny Desk (home) concert, is about a broken heart. It's a subject tackled by many, but her lyrical prowess sets the scene in the hospital, where the doctor cuts her open, sees her critical condition, and takes out her broken heart. She sings, "Put the pieces back together, looks like it's been shattered by a bad love," later adding, "You'd rather feel this pain than have a broken heart." Hearing these songs stripped to their essence — just Kate Davis and her guitar — exposes her charm and wit.

I look forward to what she comes up with as time allows her to write more timeless tales.

SET LIST
"Cloud Open"
"Heart I Like"
"Myself"
"Ride or Die"
