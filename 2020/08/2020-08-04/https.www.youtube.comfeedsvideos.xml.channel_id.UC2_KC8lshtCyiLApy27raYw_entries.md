Ya know, pokemon is something I find myself talking about quite a bit on this channel. Why do I do it? I don’t know, suppose its just all those squishy pokemons give me a warm feeling in the bottom of my heart.

Or not, who cares.

It’s a video about pokemon mystery dungeon, and some other stuff not about pokemon mystery dungeon. Does anybody really read these descriptions? Like I know I’m supposed to do them but why?

I mean I leave some links to social media stuff and additional footage credits, but this whole “explain what the video is about” concept is so bizarre. Like, by the time you read this you probably know what the video is about anyway, it’s in the title right?
