We all use the internet every day but do we really understand how it works? And do we know what's on the horizon? Snazzy Labs takes an exclusive tour of one of the most beloved internet companies in America, UTOPIA Fiber, a non-profit government-owned fiber network that leases its infrastructure out to ISPs. UTOPIA coverage areas have very inexpensive home and business gigabit internet, 10 gigabit internet, and even 100 gigabit internet thanks to the power of fiber technology. We tour a fiber hut, see a home installation, and take a look at the company's network operations room. Don't miss this unique video.
