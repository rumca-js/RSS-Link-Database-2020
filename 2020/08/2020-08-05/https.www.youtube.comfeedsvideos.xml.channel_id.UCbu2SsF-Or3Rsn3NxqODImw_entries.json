The GameSpot crew got a chance to check out the beta a few days early, trying out four of its characters--Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, and Ms. Marvel aka Kamala Khan--as well as seeing its live game and multiplayer systems in action. In the video above, we run through our impressions of the beta, which answered a few questions and left us some more.\n\nTopics discussed include combat, character progression, teamwork, the loot grind, and the level design. There's a lot to cover in this beta, and while we've only seen a small slice of what to expect from the whole game, we've got a lot of thoughts about story, multiplayer, and whether Marvel's Avengers can keep players engaged for the long haul.\n\nThe beta will be released first on August 7 for those who pre-ordered the game on PlayStation 4. The following Friday, August 14, it will be an open beta for PS4 players and the pre-order beta for Xbox and PC users. Then on August 21 it will be the open beta for Xbox One and PC players. The full release of Marvel\u2019s Avengers will be September 4, 2020 for PS4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC with PS5 and Xbox Series X versions coming later. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:30 - How does Avengers feel to control?\n06:18 - Thoughts on the game's structure\n10:56 - Thoughts on story missions\n15:37 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRJLpp-0YdI", "date_published": "2020-08-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare & Warzone - Official Season 5 Battle Pass Trailer", "description": "Drop in with new weapons, new evolving operator skins, new gear, and more in #ModernWarfare and #Warzone with the Season Five Battle Pass.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mqyk6RvI-V0", "date_published": "2020-08-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fortnite - Official Joy Ride Update Trailer", "description": "Take to the roads in all-new wheels with the Fortnite Joy Ride update, available now.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MlWHkYrKVY", "date_published": "2020-08-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Grounded Early Access Review", "description": "Grounded plants the seeds of a good survival game in its miniaturist world, but it'll definitely take some time for them to grow.\n\nObsidian Games' survival game Grounded is available now on PC and Xbox.

This would be in addition to the State of Play on August 6. The last PS5 stream was in June. We still don't have a price or release date for the PlayStation 5, so hopefully those details will be part of the next event.\n\nThe first act of Baldur's Gate 3 was supposed to come to early access in August, but it's been delayed. Larian Studios says the delay is due to the challenging working conditions during COVID-19. And finally, xCloud support will be available for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, starting on September 15th. There will be over 100 games available on launch. \n\nWhile you're here, check out GameSpot's merch store.
