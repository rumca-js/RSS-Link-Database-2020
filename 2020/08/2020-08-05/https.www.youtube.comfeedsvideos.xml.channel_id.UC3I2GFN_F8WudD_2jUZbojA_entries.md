Refill (http://www.refill.live) is a community-driven, live-streamed benefit concert to help raise $25,000 for the Seattle Artist Relief Fund (SARF), a Black-led community response to help provide direct financial support to artists who have been affected by COVID-19.
  
With the global pandemic extending further into the future, artists from Seattle recognized a need for renewed focus and funding to support Seattle artists through SARF. In partnership with SARF, LANGSTON, and KEXP, we present this session with Northwest artist Chong The Nomad. 

Donate through this video where 100% of your donations go directly to artists in need.
