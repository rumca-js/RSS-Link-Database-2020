Confirming rumors and in a big shakeup for the familiar formula, Microsoft recently announced that Halo Infinite’s multiplayer will be entirely free. In a new video feature, GameSpot editor Eddie Makuch explains why that may be the smartest move Microsoft has made in years for Halo, and one that could pay dividends to help the franchise grow.

In the full video, Eddie goes into detail about how Halo Infinite’s multiplayer going free should help improve the online experience and keep the playerbase connected and engaged over the years. The video also touches on some of the potential issues that may crop up, like cheating.

Be sure to check out the full video above, and you can read an even more in-depth written editorial on the subject on GameSpot to find out more.

With the lackluster reveal for the campaign mode in July, fans are right to be skeptical and hesitant about Halo Infinite’s multiplayer going free, but I’m hoping these fears are unfounded. 343 has promised to show Halo Infinite’s multiplayer “soon” and talk about its many innovations, and I can’t wait to see it. It could be the beginning of a new era for Halo.

Capcom announced five new characters are on the way for Street Fighter V's final season. Dan and Rose, last seen in Street Fighter IV, were the first to be revealed. Oro, who was last playable in Street Fighter III was the third character confirmed to be making a return. Akira Kazama from Rival Schools was announced, and she has a connection to Sakura so will fit right in among the Street Fighter crew. The fifth and final character has yet to be announced but the Season 5 Roadmap shows new stages, costumes, and more reveals will happen over the course of the next year. 

Xbox Live Gold is here to stay, after rumors suggesting it would be discontinued were clarified by Microsoft.

Another Microsoft livestream is planned for this month that may contain more information on what we'll see next.

Phil Hornshaw, Jordan Ramée, and Jean-Luc Seipke all sit down to discuss their time with the Marvel's Avengers Beta.

A beta for Marvel's Avengers has arrived, giving players a chance to actually try Crystal Dynamics' upcoming superhero live game. The GameSpot crew got a chance to check out the beta a few days early, trying out four of its characters--Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Black Widow, and Ms. Marvel aka Kamala Khan--as well as seeing its live game and multiplayer systems in action. In the video above, we run through our impressions of the beta, which answered a few questions and left us some more.

Topics discussed include combat, character progression, teamwork, the loot grind, and the level design. There's a lot to cover in this beta, and while we've only seen a small slice of what to expect from the whole game, we've got a lot of thoughts about story, multiplayer, and whether Marvel's Avengers can keep players engaged for the long haul.

The beta will be released first on August 7 for those who pre-ordered the game on PlayStation 4. The following Friday, August 14, it will be an open beta for PS4 players and the pre-order beta for Xbox and PC users. Then on August 21 it will be the open beta for Xbox One and PC players. The full release of Marvel’s Avengers will be September 4, 2020 for PS4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC with PS5 and Xbox Series X versions coming later.

## Next PS5 Event Coming This Month? | Save State

Sony's next PS5 event is reportedly happening in August, while Baldur’s Gate 3 has been delayed. And in September, Xbox Game Pass xCloud support starts.

A new report from Bloomberg suggests Sony’s next PS5 event is coming later this month, though plans could still change. This would be in addition to the State of Play on August 6. The last PS5 stream was in June. We still don't have a price or release date for the PlayStation 5, so hopefully those details will be part of the next event.

The first act of Baldur's Gate 3 was supposed to come to early access in August, but it's been delayed. Larian Studios says the delay is due to the challenging working conditions during COVID-19. And finally, xCloud support will be available for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, starting on September 15th. There will be over 100 games available on launch. 

While you're here, check out GameSpot's merch store.  Until the end of August, all the proceeds will go to charity, split between Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 direct relief.
