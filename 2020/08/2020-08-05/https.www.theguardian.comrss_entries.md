On 6 August, a bill was passed in parliament stripping the state of Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/04/kashmir-curfew-brought-in-as-region-marks-one-year-since-special-status-revoked">special status</a> enshrined in the Indian constitution.

All three are produced by the huge <a href="http://www.pantomime.com/">Qdos</a> operation whose pantomimes are seen by more than two million people each festive season.</p><p>King’s theatre puts on the bestselling panto in Scotland, playing to audiences of more than 90,000 each year. It provides nearly 30% of the annual income for its operator, Capital Theatres, and the postponement will result in a £2.3m loss. Fiona Gibson, chief executive of Capital Theatres, said it was the “biggest blow to date” of the perilous months that have left the UK theatre industry in crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/05/christmas-panto-cancellations-theatres-uk-industry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>YouGov poll is bad news for travel industry as uncertainty around Covid restrictions causes swathes of cancellations and redundancies</p><p>Most UK holidaymakers would cancel a holiday if they had to wear a mask in public on a trip, according to a new report.

<p>A band of cult TV fans are keeping their favourite shows alive in audio form – with the help of some serious A-list talent</p><p>It used to be that when the axe fell on a television show, that really was it. Full stop. Game over. Move on, people. But being cancelled does not necessarily mean that a series is for ever dead, as the audio production company Big Finish has been successfully proving for the past 22 years.</p><p>It was in 1998 that a small band of entrepreneurially minded Doctor Who fans convinced an initially wary BBC to grant them the licence to produce new, full-cast Doctor Who stories for release on CD and cassette. Two decades on, what started off as a modest passion project for its co-founders Jason Haigh-Ellery, Gary Russell and Nicholas Briggs is now the UK’s biggest independent producer of audio drama. Doctor Who is still its main bread-and-butter brand (Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann and David Tennant all have their own ranges), but since the early 00s, Big Finish has expanded by securing the rights to a plethora of vintage telly shows, including The Tomorrow People, Callan, Blake’s 7, Sapphire &amp; Steel, The Prisoner and Star Cops, and giving them a second life on audio, occasionally with the original actors, but sometimes with all-new casts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/05/big-finish-we-gave-benedict-cumberbatch-a-long-lunch-hour-so-he-could-audition-for-sherlock">Continue reading...</a>

## Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout review – raucous, ridiculous fun

<p><strong>PC (version tested), PS4; Mediatonic/Devolver Digital</strong><br />This silly multiplayer online game is like a Teletubbies-style athletics tournament, and is a good entry point for the battle royale curious</p><p>Fortnite has a lot to answer for. It wasn’t the first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/23/battle-royale-games-design-fortnite-pubg-call-of-duty">battle royale</a> game, but its gigantic success has ensured that no online shooter game is now complete without a mode in which dozens of players land on an island and blast each other until only one remains. Now, after two long years, comes a fresh and interesting take on the concept – one that replaces guns and bombs with giant foam obstacles and human-sized beachballs. Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout is where battle royale meets a soft-play centre.</p><p>The setup is simple: 60 players have to compete over a series of obstacle courses, and only some of them will make it to the next round. On the final challenge, the last surviving competitor is the winner. Some of the courses are ridiculous races across bouncy-castle landscapes, where sliding doors and swinging boulders knock unwary sprinters into the abyss; others throw players into a game of football (with the aforementioned giant inflatable balls). A riotous challenge where you have to steal other players’ tails is a bit like the children’s party game where you all have balloons tied to your ankles and must stamp on everyone else’s – and it’s just as vicious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/aug/05/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-review-mediatonic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Salad dressing basics are simple: oil, vinegar, salt. After that, it’s a feast of gorgeous brews to shake, stir, blend, blitz and drizzle over anything from chicken to couscous</p><p>From time to time, you meet people who say: “I can’t make salad dressing.” On the face of it this is a bit like admitting you can’t ride a bike or tie shoelaces, but what they really mean, I suspect, is that they don’t want to make the salad dressing. They want you to make the salad dressing.</p><p>That’s because although dressing isn’t complicated, it is a bit of a responsibility, requiring a delicate balance of elements. Decisions have to be made, and your judgment may come into question.

<p>I fell sick on 25 March. Four months later, I’m still dealing with fever, cognitive dysfunction, memory issues and much more</p><p>I just passed the four month mark of being sick with Covid. I am young, and I had considered myself healthy.</p><p>My first symptom was that I couldn’t read a text message. It wasn’t about anything complex – just trying to arrange a video call – but it was a few sentences longer than normal, and I couldn’t wrap my head around it. It was the end of the night so I thought I was tired, but an hour later I took my temperature and realized I had a fever. I had been isolating for 11 days at that point; the only place I had been was the grocery store.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/05/brain-fog-phantom-smells-and-tinnitus-my-experience-as-a-covid-long-hauler">Continue reading...</a>

So many, in fact, that it takes three video calls over two days (and a lot of patience on his part) to even scratch the surface. Over the last 30 years, he has been from the bottom of world football to the top and back again, stopping on every step in between and at quite a few places around the edges.</p><p>There are tales from his playing days: memories of Carlo Ancelotti, Fabio Cannavaro and Lilian Thuram at Parma; recollections of Roberto Mancini, Adriano and Luís Figo at Inter; stories of Mário Zagallo, Ronaldo and Romário Romario with Brazil. Then there are the times spent as a manager in Kenya, in a remote Romanian ski resort and the Albanian second tier. There are thoughts on the current state of football and on the barriers he faces as a black coach trying to take his career to the next level.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/05/ze-maria-brazil-parma-inter-kenya-ancelotti-adriano-ronaldo-romario-mancini-mourinho">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three summers ago, Despacito’s lilting Spanish lyrics dominated the UK charts, but since then nearly all pop hits have been in English.

Global streaming has since allowed for the overwhelming popularity of slick K-pop titans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bts">BTS</a>, the doleful flamenco flourishes of Spanish artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/28/meet-rosalia-madonna-and-almodovars-favourite-flamenco-star">Rosalía</a> and the multilingual Nigerian superstar <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/26/burna-boy-african-giant-review">Burna Boy</a> among others, suggesting that, at last, non-English-language hits are moving beyond novelties such as <a href="https://youtu.be/AMT698ArSfQ">The Ketchup Song</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/YnopHCL1Jk8">Dragostea Din Tei</a>.</p><p>But three summers on from Despacito, the UK remains dominated by English-language pop.

<p>It is pursuing me for a debt I don’t owe and I am about to apply for a mortgage </p><p><strong>I have been hounded by E.ON for more than six months for a debt I don’t owe. As soon as I moved into my rented property I arranged for Utility Warehouse to supply me with gas and electricity. A month later, I began to receive bills from E.ON.

Nonetheless, I’ve since received numerous bills and phone calls and am always told that “as long as it is on the system you will receive calls from us”. Recently E.ON decided it did not supply me with gas, but I am still being pursued for electricity charges plus a debt collection agency fee. I am now being threatened with bailiffs’ visits, bailiffs’ charges and supply disconnection.

<p>From Portugal to Pakistan, the Guardian’s international correspondent Michael Safi looks at the different ways countries have been affected by the virus and the impact that is having on the lives of people there</p><p>It’s six months since Covid-19 was registered as an urgent threat, and although the panic at the scenarios that filled imaginations in those first weeks – of millions of imminent deaths, medical systems buckling and food supplies running scarce – has largely abated, the virus has not. More than 200 days since coronavirus was first detected, public health authorities say the number of infections is accelerating and the peak still lies ahead. In early August, the world finds itself at a nebulous stage: past the shock of the pandemic but without a clear end in sight.</p><p>The Guardian international correspondent <strong>Michael Safi </strong>talks to<strong> Rachel Humphreys</strong> about the different ways in which countries have dealt with the virus – from some in Europe who seemed to have bent the curve but are now experiencing a second wave to developing nations such as Pakistan who felt quarantine posed <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/south-asia/article/3087080/pakistan-pm-imran-khan-says-country-may-have-live-coronavirus">a greater risk to life</a> than coronavirus itself. It is a period of grinding negotiation between a virus whose dynamics are still mysterious and the increasingly pressing need to earn incomes, educate children and connect with one another.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/aug/05/how-the-world-is-coping-with-coronavirus-six-months-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On 5 August 2019, India revoked the Muslim-majority territory’s semi-autonomous status and began a devastating crackdown</p><p>For the past year, Fayaz Tilgami’s poetry has spoken of nothing but loss: a lost home, a lost language, a lost world. “We have lost our existence; it has been snatched from us,” said the 70-year-old Kashmiri poet, his voice heavy with sorrow.</p><p>A year ago, on 5 August 2019, the Indian government, led by prime minister Narendra Modi, repealed article 370 of the Indian constitution. For almost 70 years, the provision had given the disputed, majority-Muslim state of Jammu and Kashmir a semi-autonomous status, with special powers over issues such as jobs and residency. The special status had been granted to Kashmir in exchange for joining the Indian union after independence in 1947.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/05/our-identity-has-been-robbed-life-in-kashmir-after-a-year-of-crisis">Continue reading...</a>
