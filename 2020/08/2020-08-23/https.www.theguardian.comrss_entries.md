<p>Photographer Zoë Savitz meets up with protesters halfway into a 50-mile journey between two camps<br /></p><p>The controversial HS2 rail route is slicing through the English countryside, destroying some of its most beautiful ancient habitat. Many protesters are out in an attempt to protect the trees and forests. Luke, Rebecca and Ben travelled 50 miles, on horseback, down the HS2 line from one protest camp at Crackley Woods near Kenilworth to another at Rosehill Farm, Buckingham. Along the route they stayed in soon-to-be-chopped-down forests, scouting new locations for a protest camp to aid their attempt to halt the massive HS2 project. This is a photo essay of their journey.</p><p>I met the protesters halfway through their two-week journey. Shandy, Stoic and Gabs the three horses, were packed up and ready to leave when I arrived. As we began to walk I discovered that everyone has been living on camp for five months. “It’s a hard lifestyle that comes with a really good purpose; we are fighting a battle for a really good reason,” said Becca.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/23/hs2-protests-a-journey-through-ancient-woods-on-horseback">Continue reading...</a>

## The future is fungal: why the 'megascience' of mycology is on the rise

<p>The study of fungi has long been overshadowed by more glamorous scientific quests. But biologist Merlin Sheldrake is on a mission to change that</p><p>As a boy, Merlin Sheldrake really loved the autumn. In the garden of his parents’ house – he grew up a few moments from Hampstead Heath, which is where he and I are walking right now, on an overcast summer morning – the leaves would fall from a big chestnut tree, forming gentle drifts into which he liked nothing more than to hurl himself. Wriggling around until he was fully submerged, Sheldrake would lie there, quite content, “buried in the rustle, lost in curious smells”. As he writes in his wondrous new book, <em>Entangled Life</em>, these autumnal piles were both places to hide and worlds to explore.</p><p>But as the months passed, they shrank: reaching into them, trying to find out why, he would pull out matter that looked more like soil than leaves. What was going on? Turning to his father for an answer (he is the son of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/feb/05/rupert-sheldrake-interview-science-delusion">Rupert Sheldrake</a>, the controversial science writer best known for proposing the concept of “morphic resonance”) was how he first came to learn about decomposition, and thus it is to these rotting leaves that we may trace his original interest in the “neglected megascience” of mycology – the study of fungi – even if neglect is a relative term. “In east Asia, fungi have been loved and revered for thousands of years,” he says. “In China, there are temples to the man who worked out how to cultivate shiitake mushrooms. But yes, in the west it has been neglected.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/23/the-future-is-fungal-why-the-megascience-of-mycology-is-on-the-rise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Serious times call for serious measures – such as drawing smiley faces on fruit – and what’s more, the science proves it</p><p>By the fifth week of lockdown, I had mastered the art of silliness. My flatmates and I had drawn smiley faces on fruit, stuck googly eyes on vegetables and dressed up as our favourite pop stars. On social media I noticed similar responses to the “unprecedented” times we found ourselves in: parents jumping in on their children’s TikTok dance challenges, people dressing up in black tie or costumes to take out the bins. I’d chalked it up as cabin fever, but even in this more relaxed phase of lockdown, with some of our pre-pandemic pastimes back on the agenda (albeit in adapted form), the spirit of silliness endures in my flat. It turns out that playfulness is, in fact, a distinct personality trait, like extroversion or conscientiousness – and those who possess it in adulthood may be more resilient.</p><p>In this strange in-between time, half in, half out of lockdown, I now realise that cultivating a sense of the absurd might be crucial to weathering the uncertainty of the weeks and months to come. Silliness does not have to deny the gravity of the situation – but it can help you get through it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/23/why-it-is-sensible-to-be-silly-serious-times-call-for-drawing-smiley-faces-on-fruit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alan Cumming puts his trademark drollery to diabolic effect in this exhilarating twist on Little Red Riding Hood</p><p>Each week through these Covid months the National Theatre of Scotland has been releasing tiny, sharp digital dramas under the title <a href="https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/events/scenes-for-survival">Scenes for Survival</a>. <a href="https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/latest/john-rebus-the-lockdown-blues">Brian Cox plays Ian Rankin’s Inspector Rebus</a>. Janey Godley (and dachshund) appears in her own <a href="https://www.nationaltheatrescotland.com/latest/alone">not-much-missing-my-dead-husband piece</a>.

And an exhilarating departure for online monologues, which have in the main been elegiac or mournful, looking backwards or forwards or inwards. Johnny McKnight’s snarling, witty script is driven by plot – and by the sinuous abilities of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/alan-cumming">Alan Cumming</a>, an actor who makes drollness look like a specialist branch of the diabolic arts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/aug/23/out-of-the-woods-review-alan-cumming-johnny-mcknight-scenes-for-survival-national-theatre-scotland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Initiatives to help the most vulnerable in society to get access to banking services are being expanded</p><p>Gary Mooney and Carl Boothroyd were released from prison in February this year. Then, just a few weeks later, they and everyone else around them, were put into lockdown. “I thought I was going to build my life up but I couldn’t do that because the world got locked down. No one could really do anything,” says Mooney, 43, currently living in Preston.</p><p>The past few months have been difficult for everyone, but particularly for the most vulnerable. However, there has been a sliver of good news to help them regain a foothold in everyday living – a scheme to set up bank accounts for homeless people, ex-prisoners, those living in insecure housing and others who have previously fallen under the radar, has been expanded.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/aug/23/why-a-bank-account-can-be-key-to-beginning-a-new-life-after-prison">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new documentary follows the 30-year cosmic quest by US space enthusiast John Shepherd. What drove him to beam messages and music, from Can to Coltrane, into space?<br /></p><p>In the mid-1960s, when he was a boy living in rural Michigan, John Shepherd began thinking of ways to make contact with alien life forms. “It was round about the time that a show called <em>The Outer Limits</em> was on television,” he recalls. “I remember being fascinated by the idea of somehow building my own scientific instruments to explore the mysterious phenomenon that is extraterrestrial life.”</p><p>In 1972, from the living room of his grandparent’s house, he began chasing his dream by broadcasting a series of electronic tone pulses “towards the stars”. So began an extraordinary 30-year journey he called <a href="http://projectstrat.com/">Project STRAT</a> (Special Telemetry Research and Tracking). It would soon take over his life, and the lives of his grandparents, who found themselves living amid an expanding array of what he calls “beautiful and unusual instruments”, including dual-channel oscillators, cathode-ray tubes, giant screens to monitor incoming signals and a low frequency transmitter sending signals millions of miles into deep space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/23/the-man-who-tried-to-contact-aliens-from-his-grandmas-living-room">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With new varieties evoking the smell of damp music festival sleeping bags, I fear we may have taken a step too far</p><p>With the world gripped by a disease that causes people to lose their sense of smell, it’s surprising to learn that the scented candle industry is doing so well. I mean, it was always a bit surprising, but a massive economic downturn coupled with millions of people suffering olfactory shutdown might hit sales, you’d think. But then maybe people are buying them to check they haven’t got the coronavirus?</p><p>After all, smell is the sense that it’s easiest to be unaware of losing. It’s not like going blind, which people tend to notice almost immediately. The same goes for sudden hearing loss – even in a library, it would be obvious. But, thanks to the general hygiene standards that obtained even pre-lockdown, we’re quite often in situations that don’t smell of much. No one wants to self-isolate for no reason, so perhaps lighting a candle and hoping for a reassuring gush of lavender or sandalwood is the solution favoured by those too proud to push out a fart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/23/why-the-scented-candle-really-gets-on-my-wick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dr Dominic Pimenta resigned from his cardiology post after Boris Johnson’s chief advisor made his controversial car journey. Was it the right decision?<br /></p><p>On 24 May, a couple of days after it was revealed that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown" title="">Dominic Cummings</a> had travelled to Durham during the lockdown, a British cardiologist, Dr Dominic Pimenta, <a href="https://twitter.com/juniordrblog/status/1264520629203734530" title="">published a tweet</a> in which he threatened to resign if Cummings did not. For Pimenta, news of Cummings’s trip had landed like a blow. In March, he had been drafted on to a Covid-19 intensive care unit, where he had witnessed suffering and death, struggle and recovery: “This sheer volume of human capacity that had been devoted to trying to save lives.” His tweet came at the end of a terrible weekend of intensive care shifts, during which he had watched patients die, their loved ones absent, and he had given everything of himself and seen colleagues do the same. And now <em>this</em>? “If we are going to be asked to risk our lives,” he wrote later, “the least we can expect is to be treated like people.”</p><p>Pimenta’s tweet was widely shared. By the following morning he’d become a national news story, and he was invited by the media to share more of what he wanted to say: how he hoped that by making a stand he might highlight the recent sacrifices of healthcare workers while reassuring the public that their own sacrifices had not been in vain, that the lockdown was saving lives, that they must maintain faith in it. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/05/scotland-chief-medical-officer-seen-flouting-lockdown-advice-catherine-calderwood" title="">Catherine Calderwood</a>, Scotland’s former chief medical officer, had recently resigned for a minor lockdown transgression. Pimenta wanted Cummings to do the same, or to at least acknowledge how irresponsible he’d been. “It was an act of principle,” Pimenta says. “And the principle was: this isn’t acceptable, <em>I</em> will not accept it. All I ever wanted was for the government to underline the importance of the lockdown.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/23/it-was-an-act-of-principle-the-covid-doctor-who-quit-over-cummings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Don’t be misled. It is political judgments, not obscure equations, which are doing so much to damage our children’s futures</p><p>What children know and too many politicians seem not to: a few years ago, the psychologists Alex Shaw and Kristina Olson <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/uwkids/Shaw.Olson.2012.pdf">ran an experiment</a> in which they told young children about two boys, Dan and Mark, who had cleaned up their room and were to be rewarded with rubbers (why rubbers should be seen as a reward I don’t know). However, there were five rubbers, so they could not be divided equally between the two boys. What should they do? The vast majority of children thought that one eraser should be thrown away, so there could be an even split between Dan and Mark. However, when the children heard that “Dan did more work than Mark”, they were quite comfortable giving three to Dan and two to Mark.</p><p>The children, in other words, had a deep commitment to fairness – anyone who has children will know that their favourite cry is “but that’s not fair!” – but they also recognised that the meaning of fairness could change depending on context. If Dan worked harder than Mark, it was only fair that he received more of the goodies, rather than fairness always requiring an equal division of the rewards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/23/the-cruel-exams-algorithm-has-laid-bare-the-unfairness-at-the-heart-of-our-schools">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Abolishing Public Health England or the overseas aid department is easy. The challenge is to create new institutions that will reshape Britain </p><p>The difference between a revolt and a revolution is that the latter seeks to build a new order while the former knows only destruction. This government has proved its talent for popular revolt. Within a year, Boris Johnson has stormed Labour’s ”red wall”, wrested Brexit from a reluctant parliament, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/29/the-guardian-view-on-the-disappearing-aid-a-shake-up-with-lethal-consequences">abolished the Department for International Development</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/16/ministers-criticised-over-plan-to-scrap-public-health-england">Public Health England</a>, and threatened the future of the BBC. But there is, as yet, no plan in evidence for completing the revolution.</p><p>It is much harder to erect institutions than to tear them down. Consider Whitehall’s construction of an entirely new state architecture to manage coronavirus in the past six months, which even ministers admit has been a struggle. The recurring dysfunction of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/11/englands-test-and-trace-saga-is-at-the-heart-of-the-governments-coronavirus-failures">national contact-tracing system</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/nhs-coronavirus-crisis-volunteers-frustrated-at-lack-of-tasks">failure of the NHS volunteering </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/nhs-coronavirus-crisis-volunteers-frustrated-at-lack-of-tasks"> scheme</a>, the lack of remote teaching for every child – these are all testament to the difficulty of building new systems from scratch.

## Don’t be bitter: how to avoid toxic plants

<p>Three ways to keep safe when our much-loved crops revert to their wild old ways<br /></p><p>One of the most fascinating things for me as a greedy botanist is quite how different our most commonly cultivated crops are to their wild ancestors. Today’s sweet, seedless bananas are the result of an accidental sterile hybrid of two wild species that are so packed full of ball bearing-like seeds they are essentially inedible. The fat, juicy sweetcorn cobs we know from supermarkets started life as tiny sprigs of rock-hard seeds of a Mexican grass called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/04/highereducation.internationaleducationnews" title="">teosint</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/04/highereducation.internationaleducationnews" title="">e</a>. A totally different species. But perhaps the most extreme examples are crops like potatoes and squashes, whose wild relatives are packed so full of bitter toxins that it took thousands of years of selective breeding by farmers to make them edible.</p><p>Ornamental squash cultivars are full of toxic compounds</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/23/toxic-plants-three-ways-to-keep-safe-when-crops-revert-to-their-wild-old-ways">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a plus-size black woman, Stephanie Yeboah has faced decades of racism and fat phobia. Here, the author of Fattily Ever After, reveals how she overcame prejudice to accept herself – and live with confidence</p><p>Let me paint the scene. It’s October 2019. I’m on a deserted beach in St Lucia, on a work trip with other influencers. It’s a balmy 38C and I’m wearing a duo-toned glitter bikini underneath a yellow beach skirt. In a moment of sheer spontaneity, I rip off the skirt and run into the sea. To most people, this would be an everyday response to hitting the beach, but for me it was an act of emancipation; a decision, made in the moment, that I would never let the opinions of others hold power over my body and my self-esteem. It was an attempt to stick two fingers up at “bikini body” culture – the idea that in order to wear a bikini, or to feel confident at the beach, you need to present as super slim. Here I was in this fat body – in a bikini nonetheless – having fun, feeling free, unapologetically me. It felt exhilarating.</p><p>It had taken many years to get to this point. Until the age of eight or nine, I had been a happy, active child. I was a bit taller and bigger than other kids, sure, but it had mostly been a non-issue for me, until I started to be made aware of my weight by my dad. He would frequently snatch away my plate in the middle of a meal and comment on how much bigger my arms and legs were getting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/23/stephanie-yeboah-plus-size-influencer-how-i-learned-to-stop-using-my-body-as-a-punch-bag">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Christopher Nolan’s nuclear apocalypse thriller dazzles and disorients – but can it entice people back to the cinema?</p><p>In Christopher Nolan’s latest head-scratcher and surely the summer’s most awaited film, Russian gazillionaire Andrei Stor (Kenneth Branagh) has access to a nuclear weapon that could annihilate the planet. He intends to use it. Fortunately, a mysterious international organisation called Tenet has hired a special agent (<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/26/blackkklansman-review-spike-lee-blistering-return-to-form">BlacKkKlansman</a></em>’s John David Washington) to stop him.</p><p>Washington, or “the Protagonist”, as he is referred to in the credits, is tasked with saving the world. Nolan, on the other hand, is tasked with saving cinema. Films such as <em>The Dark Knight</em>, the centrepiece of his moody, straight-faced Batman trilogy, and the high-concept espionage thriller <em>Inception</em> helped to cement the British writer-director’s reputation as a rare auteur able to infuse the blockbuster with complex ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/23/tenet-review-christopher-nolan-john-david-washington-robert-pattinson-elizabeth-debicki">Continue reading...</a>

They were never in my comedy. I’d always been focused to get to the next milestone, the next show, the next fringe.

Was that to help tell this story?<br /></strong>I wanted to get this material out of myself, but I was writing about my life in the third person at first, workshopping it as short stories. Then, towards the end of the first year, I wrote something for an assessment, which became a chapter in the book, relatively unchanged [a chapter called Hands, which details the first incident of sexual abuse Davies suffered, at the age of “eight or nine”]. The assessment just had my student number on it, so it felt safe to write it. The tutor feedback was anonymous, too. It allowed me to present a version of myself where nothing was concealed from view.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/23/alan-davies-ive-become-a-huge-enemy-of-silence-and-secrecy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While some scientists believe the virus has become less deadly, others look at the factors that suggest otherwise</p><p><strong>Are Covid-19 death rates decreasing?<br /></strong>Most statistics indicate that although cases of Covid-19 are rising in many parts of Europe and the United States, the number of deaths and cases of severe complications remain relatively low. For example, patients on ventilators have dropped from 3,000 at the epidemic’s peak in Britain to 70. At the same time, the number of cases in the UK have begun to rise in many areas.</p><p><strong>Why lies behind this trend?<br /></strong>Doctors are unsure exactly what is going on. Some suggest that medical interventions are more successful at treating those who suffer complications from the disease. For example, the drug dexamethasone was recently shown to improve survival rates among patients requiring ventilation. Others argue that different factors are involved. One suggestion is that Covid-19 is now becoming a disease of younger people who are less likely to die or suffer serious complications.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/23/why-do-covid-fatalities-remain-low-when-infection-numbers-are-rising">Continue reading...</a>

Now Agutter, who is about to start filming the tenth season of the BBC drama <em>Call the Midwife,</em> in which she plays Sister Julienne, has reprised her role in the story of the three children who move from London with their mother to a dilapidated cottage in Yorkshire, suddenly impoverished after their father disappears. This time she is taking part in a remarkable project by a charity set up to help rehabilitate prisoners into society.</p><p>Her involvement – which comes as the 1970 film is enjoying a new lease of life on the BBC iPlayer – reflects her own commitment to working with prisoners and children from disadvantaged backgrounds, which stretches back to her youth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/23/jenny-agutter-the-original-railway-child-still-bringing-hope-to-prisoners">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A candid shot of the young senator by Life magazine’s Ed Clark portrayed him as a man to lead a new generation into a new decade</p><p>Ed Clark, a <em><a href="https://www.life.com/photographer/edward-clark/">Life</a></em><a href="https://www.life.com/photographer/edward-clark/"> magazine staff photographer</a>, was commissioned to photograph the Kennedy family at home in Georgetown in 1958. JFK was campaigning to be elected to a second term as Massachusetts’s senator and, if successful, there were strong rumours that he would make a run for the presidency in 1960. After several days taking pictures of husband and wife, Clark asked over lunch at the house if he could get a picture of the senator with his baby daughter, Caroline. “Jackie said no,” he recalled, “that she was upstairs asleep. But Jack bounded up the stairs, and I followed.”</p><p>Clark took a spontaneous roll of film up in the nursery. It included this picture capturing the moment Caroline woke up, wide-eyed with delight to see her father. The nation was starting to share that excitement. Clark’s cover story for <em>Life</em> did much to advance the growing conviction that Kennedy was a leader for a new generation and a new decade. Up until that moment, presidents were far more likely to be grandparents than new dads, and family photographs were largely awkwardly staged compositions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/23/the-big-picture-a-tender-family-moment-with-jfk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The convention will be a ghastly reminder of what happened to the party of Lincoln – even as it desperately grabs for his mantle</p><p>The Republican convention that nominates Donald Trump for a second term will be the greatest event in the political history of cancel culture. What Trump is cancelling is nothing less than the Republican party as it has existed before him. He ran in 2016 in the primaries on cancelling the GOP and in 2020 he ratifies his triumph. After the election, political scientists and historians will study his obliteration of the Republican party as his greatest and most enduring political achievement.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/15/rick-perlstein-reaganland-donald-trump-nixon-republicans">Rick Perlstein: 'If you're not writing about the berserk, you're not writing about America'</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/23/how-donald-trump-canceled-republican-party-sidney-blumenthal-lincoln">Continue reading...</a>
