Hopefully, though, this takes a different approach to those which are already out there.\n\nRather than focussing on  I take a look at why Elon Musk has become such a revered figure in recent years and why so many people have embraced Elon Musk's Loop, Tesla, Hyperloop, Spacex, Mars Mission, Neuralink and other projects.\n\nDrawing partly on the work of Mark Fisher and Franco \"Bifo\" Birardi, I consider how human perceptions of the future (at least in the advanced capitalist nations) have changed over time. In particular, I'm interested in how Elon Musk's rise might be read as a response to what Birardi and Fisher refer to as the \"Slow Cancellation of the Future\" during the ascendency of neoliberalism (or neoliberal capitalism) in the 1970s, 80s, 90s and 2000s.\n\nI also argue that Elon Musk might have more than a little in common with figures in the political sphere such as Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (AOC) and \"The Squad\", Jeremy Corbyn etc. who have also recently sought to break from the status quo and invited us to imagine bold new futures.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com/\n\n#ElonMusk #SpaceX #Neuralink", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OtKEetGy2Y", "date_published": "2020-08-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
