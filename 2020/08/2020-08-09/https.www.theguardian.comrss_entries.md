<p>When a picture of Kano was used in place of Wiley, readers asked to know how it happened – and how it can be prevented</p><p>At 6am on Wednesday 29 July, an opinion piece by Owen Jones was published on the Guardian’s website. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/29/twitter-boycott-racism-social-media-wiley-newspapers">Tackling racism on social media is just the tip of the iceberg</a>, the writer set out his stall with reference to the grime artist Wiley, whose recent antisemitic posts would eventually lead to him being banned from Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p>The article’s main image purported to show Wiley but, as readers would soon point out, was in fact of fellow grime pioneer, songwriter and actor Kano. The picture was changed immediately after the newsdesk was alerted at about 7.45am. The paper’s head of opinion, Jonathan Shainin, followed up by apologising privately to Kano and later that day the Guardian publicly issued an unreserved apology.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/09/mistakes-identities-dismayed-readers-change">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jürgen Klopp’s side coasted to the title yet were the league’s second-best team according to the popular metric. Are Liverpool baffling the boffins – or are we missing the point?</p><p>There was just the faintest whiff of schadenfreude about it. A table had been published showing how the Premier League <a href="https://understat.com/league/EPL">would have finished</a> if it were decided by expected goals. “Look,” a colleague said, “according to xG Manchester City should have won the title by 15 points.” In fact, over the past two seasons, Liverpool should have had 39 points fewer. It pained the colleague to say it, but might Jürgen Klopp have exposed the limits of nerdery?</p><p>Seeking to show whether a given shot is a good chance, whether it <em>should</em> have gone in, xG is one of many metrics used in football analytics. It is, however, the first to move into the mainstream. It is featured (after the corner count) on Match of the Day, it pops up in analysis articles and is widespread on Twitter. It has also become a focal point in the debate about how far the magic of football can be distilled into numerical form. So when an xG league table looks so far off the real thing, people start asking questions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/09/liverpool-xg-jurgen-klopp">Continue reading...</a>

## It's no use shouting 'back to work' when Britain's industries are in a jobs meltdown | John Harris

<p>The old Tory exhortation won’t get manufacturing back on its feet if there’s no investment in jobs we need for the future<br /></p><p>I recently spent a weekday afternoon in the centre of Bristol, chasing the small comforts of retail therapy, and trying to do my bit for a few of my favourite shops. The experience was dreamlike, and unsettling: businesses smattered with hazard tape, half-deserted streets, and a rush hour that seemed to amount to little more than a few momentary traffic jams. Most of the city’s office workers, it seemed, were either furloughed or working at home. Normality – whatever that is – was nowhere to be seen; perhaps the most forlorn sight was that of empty buses adorned with faded adverts for films that came out before the pandemic.</p><p>The same day, alluding to both Rishi Sunak’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/05/the-guardian-view-on-eat-out-to-help-out-junk-policy">eat out to help out</a>” scheme and the near silence of our business districts, the <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tuesdays-national-newspaper-front-pages-12041990">front page</a> of the Daily Mail featured the headline “We’ve had our lunch, now let’s get back to work!”. Returning to workplaces in the midst of a possible second wave is a self-evidently dire prospect; big companies from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52734021">Google to Mastercard</a> have recently told their employees they can remain at home. But here was another example of the idea – indicative of the reflexive Tory belief that we are at heart a nation of idlers, and lately voiced by such fans of the work ethic as <a href="https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/iain-duncan-smith-says-sage-got-covid-response-wrong-in-daily-mail-1-6750832">Iain Duncan</a><a href="https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/top-stories/iain-duncan-smith-says-sage-got-covid-response-wrong-in-daily-mail-1-6750832"> Smith</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/KirstieMAllsopp/status/1290987043829489666">Kirstie Allsopp</a> – that we might be able to return to the pre-Covid world by a sheer act of collective will.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/09/work-britain-industries-jobs-tory-manufacturing-investment">Continue reading...</a>

But can something so mythical be captured on camera?

Late ’n’ Live has never been as good as it used to be.</p><p>If there was ever a heyday, it was probably before anyone thought to film it. The Gilded Balloon, in lieu of an actual festival this year, is releasing these compilations weekly.

<p>(Acony)<br />Spare yet perfectly formed, these discarded demos from Welch and David Rawlings – with more to come – offer riches galore</p><p>Fans of <a href="https://gillianwelch.com/">Gillian Welch</a> and her longtime foil David Rawlings’s reimagining of early country and bluegrass are used to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/11/popandrock">being patient</a>. Until a month ago, the pair had only released five albums proper under her name, and three in his, since Welch’s 1996 debut, <em><a href="https://gillianwelch.com/disco/revival/">Revival</a></em>. But after their studio, with all their old recordings, was <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/gillian-welch-david-rawlings-boots-album-1035488/">almost destroyed by a tornado</a> in March, they’ve changed tack. Hot on the heels of July’s covers album, <em><a href="http://gillianwelch.com/disco/all-the-good-times/">All the Good Times Are Past and Gone</a></em>, comes the follow-up to 2016’s first batch of archive recordings, <em><a href="http://gillianwelch.com/disco/boots-no-1-the-official-revival-bootleg/">The Official Revival Bootleg</a></em>, with two more volumes promised for the coming months.</p><p><a href="https://store.aconyrecords.com/products/boots-no-2-the-lost-songs-vol-1">The 16 songs here</a> (and the 32 more scheduled to appear imminently) were all recorded during one productive weekend in December 2002, but then discarded before the following year’s <em>Soul Journey</em>. Listening now, it’s hard to figure out why. Although they are demos, with little more in play than guitar and Welch’s voice, they sound fully realised. <a href="https://gillianwelch.bandcamp.com/track/first-place-ribbon">First Place Ribbon</a>, about barefoot Kathy, “the kinda girl likes the dust between her toes”, rattles along with an irresistible momentum; the narrator of the brooding Shotgun Song fantasises about escaping the chain gang; Valley of Tears is as desolately beautiful as its name suggests. That Welch and Rawlings have sat on such inspired recordings for almost two decades makes you wonder what other hidden treasures might be forthcoming. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/09/gillian-welch-boots-no-2-the-lost-songs-vol-1-review-inspired-outtakes-from-2002">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The king of New York’s downtown restaurant scene has survived a stroke and coronavirus but is not optimistic about the health of his industry</p><p>Keith McNally, 69, has created more than a dozen magnetic restaurants. In New York, where he moved in 1975, these include <a href="https://www.theodeonrestaurant.com/about-us-1">the Odeon</a> (memorialised by Jay McInerney), <a href="https://pastisnyc.com/">Pastis</a> and <a href="https://www.minettatavernny.com/">Minetta Tavern</a>.

Born in Bethnal Green, the son of a taxi driver and an office worker, McNally was one of the original cast of Alan Bennett’s <em>Forty Years On</em>.

But the cherry on the cake was having to sell my Cotswolds house that I’d bought only three years earlier and renovated inch by inch every day.

<p>Contemporary meets historic in a towering design achievement on the Norfolk coast</p><p>I remember the first time we saw this place, it looked terrible,” says Julian Vogel, owner of a restored 18th-century lighthouse in Winterton-on-Sea, near Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, “but it had such incredible potential.” That was almost 15 years ago and now what stands proud at the end of a pebbly drive in a small seaside village, just metres from rolling sand dunes and the North Sea, is a glorious, light-filled space.</p><p>The lighthouse had been converted into a residence by a previous owner who’d bought it in the late 1970s, but there was much work needed to give it new life. Aside from poor wiring and very tired decor, the lighthouse no longer had its original lantern, sold in the 1920s and sent to the Bahamas. In in its place was a concrete slab, installed during the Second World War when the tower was used as a lookout post. When Vogel, CEO of PR agency ModusBPCM and co-founder of Maison Margaux, a tableware hire company, and his family found it, the place had been unoccupied for years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/09/to-the-lighthouse-an-illuminating-home-conversion-in-norfolk">Continue reading...</a>

The Tories should embrace it as a celebration of the glorious patchwork of British life.” The Conservatives’ media masters were instructing them to reject racism, not because to do so was right in and of itself, but because feigning wokeness would be another way to discredit their political opponents, a job they had previously been happy to delegate to all mainstream media, clockwork Russian cyber-bots, and sexless young men on YouTube, foaming in their mum’s basements.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/09/come-summer-2021-whos-going-to-save-our-sorry-asses">Continue reading...</a>

Glimpsed through trees on a warm summer evening, its magnificent portico crested by golden sunlight, it rises like a beacon, a sight from which it’s hard to tear the eyes.

We stride, willy nilly, utterly free, grasshoppers leaping at our feet, the soft wind in the branches above us. What leafy seclusion. It’s so enveloping, and so soothing, I jump halfway out of my skin when a pheasant shrieks in the undergrowth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/09/forgive-us-our-trespasses-forbidden-rambles-with-a-right-to-roam-campaigner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Created by the Victorians as Britain industrialised, city parks and green spaces have ‘become living rooms’ during the pandemic</p><p>As lockdown eased, green spaces nationwide began to throng with crowds, drinking, picnicking and ordering pizza to be delivered to specific park benches. Tons of rubbish piled up and councils struggled to cope. But then there was an unexpected upside. “People started to do their own thing, cleaning up with bin bags and litter- pickers bought off eBay,” says Paul Rabbitts, head of parks at Watford borough council. Despair at the deluge of litter had galvanised people to get out and do their bit, sometimes bagging up rubbish before overwhelmed local authorities managed to get to it. “There is a sense of ownership,” says Rabbitts. “Having rediscovered parks, people are fearful of losing or spoiling them.”</p><p>Across Britain, parks have offered millions of people respite from the coronavirus crisis – a breathing space amid infection anxieties, crowded flats, home-schooling and job insecurities. With other venues closed, people turned to the nation’s 27,000 urban green spaces, from manicured landscapes to patchy neighbourhood parks and playing fields.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/aug/09/sanctuary-in-the-city-how-urban-parks-saved-our-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the black stuff burnt in the UK plummets to a level not seen since the early steam age, we trace its long, deep history and the problems left in its wake</p><p>Britain achieved an unlikely status as a power provider last year. Its annual consumption of coal plunged to the lowest level in 250 years. According to figures released last week, a mere 8 million tonnes were incinerated in UK factories and power plants. That is roughly the same amount that was burned nationally in 1769, when James Watt was patenting his modified steam engine.</p><p>That invention helped to spark the Industrial Revolution and triggered a massive rise in annual coal use in Britain, which soared to well over 200 million tonnes by the mid-20th century. Now levels have plummeted back to their original pre-revolution state. King coal – once the undisputed ruler of British industry – has finally been dethroned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/09/is-this-the-end-for-king-coal-in-britain">Continue reading...</a>

Along the equator, the sun is at its most intense, so everything happens faster and more spectacularly. We begin on the Galápagos, a tiny atoll that supports a remarkable variety of life: from flatfish and monstrous crabs to giant cormorants that are endlessly engaged in attritional territorial battles with iguanas. Sky’s nature docs have never quite had the authority of the Beeb’s but, even so, this is a treat. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/09/tv-tonight-a-beautiful-trip-to-the-galapagos-islands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A corruption-riddled government has presided over rising poverty for decades. Could the anger released after the catastrophe in Beirut’s docks finally topple it?</p><p>The first violent jolt seemed like a neighbourhood accident; a blown generator, or a car crash. Five seconds later, the thundering secondary blast arrived; a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/aug/07/what-we-know-about-the-beirut-explosion-video-explainer" title="">crushing surge of energy</a> that instantly sucked the air out of the city, then plunged it back with devastating weight. Giant shards of debris blew through rooms, door frames collapsed and furniture became missiles – all in what seemed like a paralysing slow motion.</p><p>A deathly still followed, and then came a cascade of shattered glass from what appeared to be every home, or tower block; hundreds of thousands of panes and pieces falling to earth at once. Many who survived the blast wave did not live beyond the seconds that followed. Days later, giant pools and trails of blood littered pavements and roads, each telling their own tale of life or death in Beirut’s apocalypse. When the glass stopped falling, the screaming started. A yellow pall of dust, smoke and chemicals shrouded the eastern suburbs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/09/chain-reaction-disaster-hastens-lebanons-moment-of-reckoning">Continue reading...</a>
