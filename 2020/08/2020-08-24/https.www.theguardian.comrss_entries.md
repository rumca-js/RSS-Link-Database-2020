## Screen-based online learning will change kids' brains. Are we ready for that? | Maryanne Wolf

<p>We are starting to see technology’s effect on child development and adult reading skills – and the research isn’t optimistic<strong><br /></strong></p><p>Literacy literally changes the human brain. The process of learning to read changes our brain, but so does what we read, how we read<em> </em>and <em>on what </em>we read (print, e-reader, phone, laptop). This is especially important in our new reality, when many people are tethered to multiple screens at any given moment. With much of the world working from home, and millions of students learning at home, developing a <a href="https://www.maryannewolf.com/reader-come-home-1">biliterate brain</a> – one adapted to both digital and traditional print literacy – has never been more important.</p><p>The poet TS Eliot presciently asked: “Where is the knowledge in our information? Where is the wisdom in our knowledge?” Neuroscientists and educators ask similar questions: will different mediums advantage or disadvantage our abilities to acquire information, distinguish what is true, immerse ourselves in the perspectives of others and turn information into knowledge, the precursor of wisdom? The emerging answers will have profound implications for shaping children’s intellectual, social-emotional and ethical development and preserving ours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/24/deep-literacy-technology-child-development-reading-skills">Continue reading...</a>

I can’t see her face but I can almost hear her smiling, a faint giggle detectable between sentences. “I also kicked my co-star in the chin and made his mouth bleed. Other than that, it was pretty scrape-free.”</p><p>A kick in the face and multiple rounds of bottling might sound like the opposite of “scrape-free”, but perhaps it is for an actor such as Williams, best known for her role as Arya Stark in Game of Thrones. As the noblewoman turned assassin, Williams’s fight scenes included some of the show’s most pivotal, such as the one in the bloody, battle-filled penultimate episode, The Long Night, which Williams trained for a year to film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/24/maisie-williams-the-people-at-the-top-of-tv-dont-want-equality">Continue reading...</a>

Jon had discovered an acid house club in London called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/28/how-we-made-shoom-acid-house-club-danny-rampling-pete-heller">Shoom</a> and took me along. He said: “Come in here, take one of these and I’ll see you in the morning.” There was so much dry ice I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face. I just danced all night. After that, we’d go to these clubs, then come home and re-create that emotional rush in our own music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/24/the-beloved-how-we-made-the-sun-rising">Continue reading...</a>

There was <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/early-school-reopenings-coronavirus-covid-19/">no evidence of any surge</a> in Covid-19-related illness as a result.

<p>Be strategic when packing – comfort is of the essence and there are plenty of ways to stretch your student budget, sartorially</p><p>When student vlogger Ehis Ilozobhie went through his closet before starting his first term at King’s College London, he wanted to take everything. “I vividly remember my dad telling me: ‘Oh you’re not going to need all this,’” he says. Despite that long-suffering parental sigh, Ilozobhie packed all his kicks, his clothes and four different suits. It didn’t take long, though, before he realised that what he was actually wearing day-in, day-out, was T-shirts, sweatpants and a jacket. And all of the stuff he wasn’t wearing? It was making an already small room feel way smaller.</p><p>So the most important bit of style advice is this: pack basic. Homesickness will probably have you home before you know it, by which point you’ll have a clearer idea of exactly what uni life is, and how best to dress for it. When packing the first time round, be practical. What’s the weather in autumn generally like where you’re headed to? What do you need to keep up your current sport or hobby? Crucially, what makes you feel most at home?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/24/how-to-ace-your-uni-wardrobe-its-way-more-casual-than-you-think">Continue reading...</a>

The final sentences of Henning Mankell’s last book about the Swedish police officer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/03/henning-mankell-wallander-troubled-man">The Troubled Man</a>, are some of the most bleakly abrupt ever put to print. “Kurt Wallander slowly descended into a darkness that some years later transported him into the empty universe known as Alzheimer’s disease,” they read. “After that there is nothing more. The story of Kurt Wallander is finished, once and for all.”</p><p>But just because we know how things end, it doesn’t mean we know how they began. And that’s where Young Wallander comes in. The new Netflix series revives Wallander as a young and naive twentysomething beat cop, before the decades of neglect and poor life choices. However, Young Wallander is also set in the present day. So what is it, exactly? A prequel? A reimagining? A reboot?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/24/young-wallander-tragedy-puzzle-berna-levin-adam-palsson-ellise-chappell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Playing 15-minute sets with cartoonish energy, the rapper donned an inflatable costume to become middle America’s worst nightmare: a gigantic, powerful black woman</p><p>Created in 1997, Lilith Fair was intended as a testament to female creativity and empowerment – a Lollapalooza-style touring caravan that would consist solely of female solo artists and bands led by women. That said, the festival, co-founded by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, promoted a narrow form of feminism in its initial incarnation: Tracy Chapman and India.Arie were among the few black artists on a roster that skewed towards the “sensitive” end of the musical spectrum, as the Observer put it at the time.</p><p>The festival’s second incarnation, however, branched out into edgier territory with the likes of Erykah Badu, Liz Phair and a breaking rapper hailing from Portsmouth, Virginia, named Missy Elliott. She already had a platinum-certified 1997 debut album, Supa Dupa Fly, and an iconic image immortalised in <a href="https://youtu.be/9UvBX3REqSY">video collaborations</a> with Hype Williams. But her sets at Lilith Fair, beginning in Palm Beach, Florida, on 26 July 1998, would be her first live performances; ones that demonstrated the potency of this legend in the making and expanded industry perceptions of what gigs could even be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/24/iconic-festival-sets-missy-elliott-lilith-fair-1998">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The sound and smell of granita – a Sicilian invention – being scraped every half-hour has become a signature soundtrack of a sweltering Roman summer </p><p>The mosquito coil smouldering away on the terrace, and scratching ice: August summed up in a smell and a sound. “If you leave it alone,” my eight-year-old tells me, “it will become a huge lolly.” He is right, but I like the scratching; the half-hourly reason to return to the freezer and take a fork to whatever liquid I have poured into a Tupperware box – lemon, melon, pear, mango, mulberry, almond – in order to make granita.</p><p>The word granita comes from the verb <em>granire –</em> to granulate or form into grains, to roughen up the surface. We can thank Sicilians for granita, who in turn acknowledge the Arabs, who, during their domination of the island, introduced <em>sharbat</em>, from the Persian “شربت”, which means a drink of sugar and water. Snow from Mount Etna and <em><a href="https://www.mammasicily.com/sites-of-interest-in-sicily/peloritani-mountains.html">i Peloritani</a></em>, a mountain range in north-east Sicily that has historically been used to cool wine, finally met sharbat and became granita (also sorbet and Roman <em>grattachecca</em>). It is a perfect example of how alimentary traditions never stay the same; how, as food historian Massimo Montanari notes, “they change with time, becoming modified as they come into contact with other traditions”, how identity comes from exchange; that traditions invent themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/24/a-taste-of-summer-rachel-roddy-granita-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Peter Humphreys, 46, and media teacher, Ana Rebolledo, 37, met on a roof terrace in Colombia in 2018. They married last year but, due to the visa process, are living apart in Lancaster and Buenos Aires<br /></p><p>When Peter Humphreys, a writer, took a trip to Colombia in January 2018, he’d been hoping to catch up with an old friend. “Just before I left I found out he wasn’t going to be there, but I thought it would be fun to go anyway and attend the Hay literary festival in Cartagena,” he says. Not long after he arrived, he spotted Ana Rebolledo, who was staying at the same hotel. “I was too shy to speak to her at first,” he admits.</p><p>Eventually, he asked if she spoke English, and the pair struck up a conversation while they were sitting on the hotel’s rooftop terrace. “I was travelling alone around South America at the time,” says Ana, a video editor and media teacher who was based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “I thought he was very friendly and cool. He asked if I’d liked to go to one of the festival events with him.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/24/how-we-met-letter-writing-peter-ana-colombia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Channel Four’s bold new documentary confronts anxieties about the male member. We go behind the scenes – and meet Ajamu, the artist and ‘sex activist’ who gets men to reveal all</p><p>A former police officer is confessing to being unable to drive without his penis becoming aroused. “Is it the rumble of the road on your balls?” he wonders aloud, while another young man in the group says: “I actually think my dick is in control [of me].” A third guy, in his 30s, describes his first attempt at masturbation: “I kind of hit it from side to side and it felt nice after a while.”</p><p>If these sound like the sort of stories you don’t often hear on mainstream TV, then that’s the point. Channel 4’s one-off show Me and My Penis aims to break the taboo around the male sex organ and start a frank conversation about masculinity. In among the penis chat, we hear from a man in his 40s called Jason who breaks down sobbing while confronting his infertility. There’s a moving account from a trans man who details the fear he had of female puberty, knowing his body would soon grow breasts he didn’t want. And one former soldier opens up about losing his legs and sustaining a severe genital injury doing bomb disposal work in Afghanistan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/24/me-and-my-penis-tv-show-ajamu-male-taboos">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As he revisits his career in a new four-part series, TV’s top documentarian looks back at his evolution from accosting cult members to making films on eating disorders and dementia</p><p>It is a strange feeling looking back at a much earlier version of yourself on television, a queasy mixture of recognition and distance, approval and shame, and above all an inescapable question: who is this plonker? Bespectacled, gawky, socially awkward and only 23 years old, I had been a surprising choice as a correspondent on Michael Moore’s TV Nation, a US network show where I stumbled around the wilds of America meeting extremists of various stripes: klansmen, cult members, sexual adventurers.</p><p>Later, based on these segments, I landed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/27/i-watched-nothing-but-louis-theroux-films-for-a-whole-weird-weekend-and-heres-what-i-learned">my own TV series, Louis Theroux’s Weird Weekends</a>. For some reason the BBC had insisted on putting my name in the title. Watching some of my early efforts again recently, with the distance of two decades, I couldn’t help passing judgment on the journalistic competence on display – whether I was asking the right questions of the porn performers and the apocalypse preppers. Sometimes I caught myself enjoying the raw, unvarnished reality and marvelling at how much we had managed to capture on tape. From time to time I saw the younger me as overly pushy and badgering, or in danger of being borderline rude. But I could see that was mostly from my awkwardness at being hired for a job I didn’t fully understand, and my worries about letting people down. Mainly I was distracted by my appearance, voice and how I came across. The way my hair is piled on top of my head. The faint mid-Atlantic twang in my accent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/24/i-was-definitely-a-bit-of-a-tool-louis-theroux-on-25-years-of-documentary-making">Continue reading...</a>
