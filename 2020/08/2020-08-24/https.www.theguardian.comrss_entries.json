That said, the festival, co-founded by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, promoted a narrow form of feminism in its initial incarnation: Tracy Chapman and India.Arie were among the few black artists on a roster that skewed towards the \u201csensitive\u201d end of the musical spectrum, as the Observer put it at the time.</p><p>The festival\u2019s second incarnation, however, branched out into edgier territory with the likes of Erykah Badu, Liz Phair and a breaking rapper hailing from Portsmouth, Virginia, named Missy Elliott. She already had a platinum-certified 1997 debut album, Supa Dupa Fly, and an iconic image immortalised in <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9UvBX3REqSY\">video collaborations</a> with Hype Williams. But her sets at Lilith Fair, beginning in Palm Beach, Florida, on 26 July 1998, would be her first live performances; ones that demonstrated the potency of this legend in the making and expanded industry perceptions of what gigs could even be.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/24/iconic-festival-sets-missy-elliott-lilith-fair-1998\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/24/iconic-festival-sets-missy-elliott-lilith-fair-1998", "date_published": "2020-08-24 10:34:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Italy in a bowl: 10 simple, delicious summer pasta recipes \u2013 chosen by chefs", "description": "<p>From bigoli with anchovies and onions to a courgette carbonara that includes the flowers, there are fantastic dishes here for every taste</p><p><em>Niklas Ekstedt, owner of <a href=\"https://ekstedt.nu/\">Ekstedt</a>, Stockholm</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/24/10-simple-delicious-summer-pasta-recipes-chosen-by-chefs\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/24/10-simple-delicious-summer-pasta-recipes-chosen-by-chefs", "date_published": "2020-08-24 10:30:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "A taste of summer: Rachel Roddy's recipe for granita | A kitchen in Rome", "description": "<p>The sound and smell of granita \u2013 a Sicilian invention \u2013 being scraped every half-hour has become a signature soundtrack of a sweltering Roman summer </p><p>The mosquito coil smouldering away on the terrace, and scratching ice: August summed up in a smell and a sound. \u201cIf you leave it alone,\u201d my eight-year-old tells me, \u201cit will become a huge lolly.\u201d He is right, but I like the scratching; the half-hourly reason to return to the freezer and take a fork to whatever liquid I have poured into a Tupperware box \u2013 lemon, melon, pear, mango, mulberry, almond \u2013 in order to make granita.</p><p>The word granita comes from the verb <em>granire \u2013</em> to granulate or form into grains, to roughen up the surface.
