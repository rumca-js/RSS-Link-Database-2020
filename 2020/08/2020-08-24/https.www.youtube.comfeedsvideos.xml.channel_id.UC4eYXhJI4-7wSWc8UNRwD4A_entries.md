The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Aug. 25, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Yola is an electrifying performer. My first experience — in the dark, dingy basement of Grimey's at the 2016 AMERICANAFEST in Nashville — was stunning, soulful and frenetic. To see this British singer now — sitting in a grassy, sunlit backyard in Nashville with acoustic guitar accompaniment — was worthy of a double-take. But that's what makes these Tiny Desk (home) concerts so fascinating. We get reintroduced to the deeper sides of so many of the participating artists. In this case, Yola performs songs with guitarist Jordan Tice of Hawktail. They're beautiful interpretations of songs from her 2019 album Walk Through Fire and her 2016 EP Orphan Offering that pull back the intensity I associate with Yola's music, but are still passionate and fervent. This is a rare Yola moment in her temporary quarantine home, so put the whiskey aside, grab a glass of iced tea and chill.

SET LIST
"Faraway Look"
"Dead And Gone"
"Love Is Light"
"It Ain't Easier"

MUSICIANS
Yola: vocals, guitar; Jordan Tice: guitar, vocals

With beats, effects and synths pumping through a DJ mixer sitting on a school desk in his home studio in Australia, we present Tame Impala like you've never heard it before. As much as I love Tame Impala's music, I'm probably more intrigued by the creative process that brings the songs to life. The studio version of the band is pretty simple on paper: All songs are written, produced and performed by Kevin Parker. For the live version, Parker is still front and center but surrounded by a host of musicians who interpret his recorded work almost to a tee.

So it came as a shock to me when the Australian maestro explained what he wanted to do for his Tiny Desk (home) concert or his "Tame Impala Soundsystem" as he puts it. "I'll get Jay (Watson) and Dom (Simper) and we'll do this kind of electronic jam with heaps of equipment around us and we'll recreate the songs with samplers and sequencers," Parker says. "I've wanted to do something like this for a while and thought Tiny Desk would be the opportunity to do it."

SET LIST
"Breathe Deeper"
"Is It True"
"Patience"

MUSICIANS
Kevin Parker: vocals; Jay Watson: music; Dom Simper: music
