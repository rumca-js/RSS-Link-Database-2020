Not prolonged viral shedding

33-year-old man, good health

Immunocompetent

First infection

3 days, cough, sore throat, fever, headache

Hospitalized

Serum at day 10, negative for IgG

26th March

Oropharyngeal antigen PCR diagnosis

14th April

Discharged asymptomatic

142 days

2nd infection

Spain - UK – HK

15th August

Oropharyngeal positive at HK airport

Hospitalised, remained asymptomatic

T, 36.5 

HR, 86

BP, 133/94

SaO2, 98 RA

CRP, 8.6 mg / L

Slightly raised, suggesting acute infection

Declining during hospitalisation

Hypokalaemia

Viral load progressively decreased

Serum day 5 of hospitalisation, positive

Genome analysis

Full sequencing performed after first and second episode

Different clade/lineage

Truncation of 58 amino acids in the virus genome

23 nucleotide changes

13 of which non-synonymous mutations

4 in the spike protein

First strain

Mostly close to strains from USA or England collected in March and April

Second strain

Switzerland and England collected in July and August

Evidence

Genomics, phylogenetic analysis

142 days, viral shedding (104 days in one pregnant woman)

Raised CPR indicating acute infection

Patient had recently returned from Europe with July and August strains

Implications

Unlikely herd immunity can eliminate SARS-CoV-2

Subsequent infections likely to be milder

Virus likely to go on circulating in the human population

Vaccine will not provide lifelong infection

Vaccine studies should include patients who have recovered from COVID

People who have had COVID should be vaccinated

People who have had COVID should continue with public health measures

Residual low level of antibodies may have controlled the second infection

Dr Maria Van Kerkhove

I haven't read the study

Our expectations, people who are infected with this virus develop an immune response 

People do develop an immune response, not completely clear yet is how strong and how long lasting

Severe, mild, asymptomatic cases, develop an immune response

More than 24 million cases

On a population level

Longitudinal studies, following the same individual underway

Thank you, Andrew, for having the courage to share your experiences and difficulties with us. Many people with be able to relate to your experience and will greatly benefit from knowing they are not alone.

Andrew had an antigen test in late April (swab test - negative). This was the first possible opportunity he had to be tested - nothing else was available before then.

UK
Symptom tracker
https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/incidence-update-21-aug

Over 4 million contributors

1,265 new cases per day

18, 933 symptomatic cases today

Data is consistent with the ONS household survey

ONS numbers slightly higher due to inclusion of asymptomatics

Symptomatic and asymptomatic cases

Down from last week

Localised outbreaks not spreading

Community spread continues

Lower death rates

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/23/why-do-covid-fatalities-remain-low-when-infection-numbers-are-rising

Europe, cases rising

Severe complications and deaths remain relatively low

UK ventilated patients, 3,000 down to 70

Infection fatality rate

Is the severity of the disease decreasing a bit?

U Pittsburgh MC doctor says COVID-19 has become ‘less prevalent’ and isn’t making people as sick

https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/06/upmc-doctor-says-covid-19-has-become-less-prevalent-and-less-severe.html

Dr. Donald Yealy

All signs that we have available right now show that this virus is less prevalent than it was weeks ago

Among people who test positive, the total amount of the virus the patient has is much less than in the earlier stages of the pandemic

We see all of this as evidence that COVID-19 cases are less severe than when this first started

Virus mutating?

https://www.healthline.com/health-news/is-the-new-coronavirus-getting-weaker-what-to-know

Triad of infectious disease, viral evolution

Study concluded that most mutations were neutral and did not affect viral lethality

Factors

Testing at an earlier stage of the illness

Social distancing, face coverings, hand and surface hygiene

Infection with lower viral load

Summer humidity reducing infection

Medical interventions more successful

Dexamethasone

Heparin

Becoming a disease of younger people

However

US, recent spike, 20s and 30s

Followed by a spike in older people

This could happen in UK and Europe in coming few weeks

US

Food and Drug Administration, emergency authorisation of convalescent plasma

Temporary emergency use authorization

https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/recommendations-investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-53884710

Health care providers or acute care facilities, obtain COVID-19 convalescent plasma from an FDA-registered blood establishment

20,000 patients reviewed, safe

Convalescent plasma or hyperimmune immunoglobulin for people with COVID‐19: a living systematic review

https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD013600.pub2/full

We are very uncertain whether convalescent plasma;

has any effect on all‐cause mortality at hospital discharge

prolongs time to death

has any effect on improvement of clinical symptoms at seven days

Safety

There is only very low‐certainty evidence for safety of convalescent plasma for COVID‐19
Allergic or respiratory problems
Transfusion‐associated dyspnoea
Transfusion‐related acute lung injury
