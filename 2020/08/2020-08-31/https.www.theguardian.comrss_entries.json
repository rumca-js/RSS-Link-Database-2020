I\u2019m doing that half-run, half-hustle you do when you\u2019re late for a train but don\u2019t really want to fully sprint. I hear a man yell after me, and the sound of footsteps running after me.

I\u2019m late, man,\u201d I say dismissively, and continue running for my train.<br /><br />I hear him run after me, the pace increasing.<br /><br />I pick up my stride for a couple of seconds and hear him do the same. Without thinking, I stop and whip around. \u201cWhat do you want?!\u201d I shout at him as assertively as I can. He does nothing. I sprint to the train station, but don\u2019t relax until the doors close and I know he hasn\u2019t got on with me.<br /><br />That was one of too many experiences I could detail for you. Every summer I, like many women, withstand a torrent of verbal harassment. Men stop their cars next to me on the road and ask where I am going. Men call at me from across the street; they hustle after me and ask how I\u2019m doing; they try to get me to take my headphones out; they yell things as they drive by; they honk, wolf-whistle, and go \u201cpsst psst\u201d. I have to cross streets and avert all eye contact. I sometimes keep headphones in with no music on so that I can hear what is going on around me for my safety. I am constantly on edge, fearing I\u2019ll have to fight someone off. <br /></p><p>You would think that with the pandemic and lockdown restrictions, the catcalling would have vanished. But even when the streets were at their emptiest during the Covid-19 outbreak, one in five women reported harassment, according to a study by <a href=\"https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/1-in-5-girls-have-experienced-street-harassment-during-lockdown\">Plan International UK</a>. Virtually no one was outside, yet women were still being harassed. Now, with lockdown lifting and masks becoming the norm, catcalling still persists. Just last week, a man pulled his car up to me while I was in a bicycle helmet, sunglasses and mask \u2013 making my face almost completely covered \u2013 and told me I looked good. When I ignored him, he shouted \u201cnot even a thank you?\u201d and some choice expletives before driving off.</p> <a

That is what we responded to in him, especially as African Americans \u2013 whose pride can be maligned, treated as effrontery, and turned into a felony because it reflects the ownership of self that white America still has a hard time embracing.
