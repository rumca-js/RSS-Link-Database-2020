<p>Out on their own with five Champions League titles in a row, the French club are sweeping all before them but remain a microcosm of the broader conversation around female sport</p><p>Perhaps the moment we all realised that Lyon were going to win the Champions League once again came about seven minutes before half-time, as Lucy Bronze stepped up to take a throw-in. As Bronze waited for the referee’s signal, she started absent-mindedly spinning the ball on the end of her finger, like one of the Harlem Globetrotters to which this all-conquering, lavishly-funded Lyon team is so frequently compared.</p><p>It was, in a strange way, the perfect emblem of a final that offered only the illusion of closeness.

Injury-marred and error-strewn at times it was ultimately a triumph of never-say-die spirit over the supposed odds as Wasps, despite a savage casualty list, secured a victory which propels them above the home side and into the top four.</p><p>To say Wasps did it the hard way would be a wince-inducing understatement. They shipped so many injuries in the first half alone that uncontested scrums were required from the 34th minute. With both specialist hookers sidelined, the scrum-half Dan Robson and the prop Simon McIntyre were forced to start throwing in to the lineouts and Bath, 13-0 up early on, must have felt they were in business.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/31/wasps-forced-to-make-do-and-mend-as-penalty-try-sees-them-overhaul-bath">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As parliament returns, Boris Johnson’s government faces a set of challenges it is woefully ill-equipped to meet</p><p>In a cringeworthy social media stunt before the last election, Boris Johnson <a href="https://pjmedia.com/instapundit/350942/" title="">mimicked</a> the famous cue-card sequence in the film Love Actually, itself a parody of Bob Dylan’s Subterranean Homesick Blues video. The prime minister’s scrawled series of messages conveyed the ultimately winning trope of “get Brexit done”. As parliament returns on Tuesday, and the nation braces for what is likely to be an autumn of considerable discontent, words from another Dylan classic, My Back Pages, seem to sum up Mr Johnson’s current situation: “My existence led by confusion boats, mutiny from stern to bow.”</p><p>The now notorious sequence of Covid-related <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/19/covid-19-climbdowns-the-uk-governments-u-turns-and-missteps" title="">U-turns</a> performed by the government reflects a chronic lack of planning and foresight. Failing to reconcile the twin priorities of safeguarding public health and protecting the economy, ministers have vacillated, prevaricated and lurched first in one direction and then the other. As the days begin to shorten, the sky is turning dark with chickens coming home to roost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/31/the-guardian-view-on-the-end-of-recess-an-autumn-of-discontent-looms">Continue reading...</a>

## Even during the pandemic, catcalling goes on. I refuse to be treated as an object | Mary Morgan

<p>This harassment is not harmless, it’s an aggressive act of male power that feeds into rape culture<br /></p><p>It’s a gloriously sunny afternoon. I’m doing that half-run, half-hustle you do when you’re late for a train but don’t really want to fully sprint. I hear a man yell after me, and the sound of footsteps running after me. I assume in my hurry I had dropped something. I stop, turn around, and address him. “What?”<br /><br />“Oh, I wanted to talk to you.”<br /><br />“What?! I’m late, man,” I say dismissively, and continue running for my train.<br /><br />I hear him run after me, the pace increasing.<br /><br />I pick up my stride for a couple of seconds and hear him do the same. Without thinking, I stop and whip around. “What do you want?!” I shout at him as assertively as I can. He does nothing. I sprint to the train station, but don’t relax until the doors close and I know he hasn’t got on with me.<br /><br />That was one of too many experiences I could detail for you. Every summer I, like many women, withstand a torrent of verbal harassment. Men stop their cars next to me on the road and ask where I am going. Men call at me from across the street; they hustle after me and ask how I’m doing; they try to get me to take my headphones out; they yell things as they drive by; they honk, wolf-whistle, and go “psst psst”. I have to cross streets and avert all eye contact. I sometimes keep headphones in with no music on so that I can hear what is going on around me for my safety. I am constantly on edge, fearing I’ll have to fight someone off. <br /></p><p>You would think that with the pandemic and lockdown restrictions, the catcalling would have vanished. But even when the streets were at their emptiest during the Covid-19 outbreak, one in five women reported harassment, according to a study by <a href="https://plan-uk.org/media-centre/1-in-5-girls-have-experienced-street-harassment-during-lockdown">Plan International UK</a>. Virtually no one was outside, yet women were still being harassed. Now, with lockdown lifting and masks becoming the norm, catcalling still persists. Just last week, a man pulled his car up to me while I was in a bicycle helmet, sunglasses and mask – making my face almost completely covered – and told me I looked good. When I ignored him, he shouted “not even a thank you?” and some choice expletives before driving off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/31/catcalling-power-women-rape-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was a thrill to see him in Black Panther.

We didn’t lose Boseman to the ongoing calamity of street violence that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/11/fans-mourn-rappers-dying-young-xxxtentacion-nipsey-hussle-juice-wrld">extinguishes so much black life</a> – and gets so much media coverage that we have been conditioned to expect it. That’s what many of my friends said as we emailed and texted about the actor’s sudden passing.</p><p>But what made Boseman’s death hard to take was that he’d made his breakthrough as a black actor playing <em>adults</em>, grown men who had to wrestle with their own expectations, as well as the diminished expectations others had for them. There was something in Boseman that understood the power of pride: his performances doubled as meditations on the allure and dangers of self-regard. That is what we responded to in him, especially as African Americans – whose pride can be maligned, treated as effrontery, and turned into a felony because it reflects the ownership of self that white America still has a hard time embracing. It’s the reason that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2016/jul/10/black-lives-matter-protests-across-the-us-in-pictures">race riots</a> have peppered America’s history from the late 1800s to the present.

<p><strong>Atelier Picasso, Bastian Gallery, London<br /></strong>This thrilling, gruelling exhibition lays bare Picasso’s twilight years in a palatial villa in Cannes – outrageous, tortured and searching for the priapic energy of his youth</p><p>Everyone runs out of steam eventually. In the case of Pablo Picasso, the process was lengthy and he fought it with flashes of fury, lust and wit. He obviously didn’t think of himself as old when, in his 70s, he posed bare-chested for the photograph that appears at the start of Bastian Gallery’s nostalgic tribute to his last studio, in postwar Cannes. Picasso would work as energetically as ever, right up to his death aged 91, leaving a heap of late works. But does the last quarter-century of his career actually add anything to the miracles that came before?</p><p>In 1900, as a teenage prodigy from Malaga via Barcelona, he visited Paris for the first time and painted brilliantly lurid scenes of dance halls and brothels. In 1907, he painted Les Demoiselles d’Avignon, torching centuries of western art in a savage conflagration that simultaneously invents cubism and surrealism. Still to come were stupendous orgies of destruction and creation and his most unexpected transformation of all, from sensual diarist of private life to public painter of modern history in Guernica.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/31/picassos-desperate-obscenities-show-of-late-works-capture-a-still-raging-genius-atelier-bastian-gallery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The third episode of HBO’s Jim Crow-era fantasy sci-fi was the scariest yet, but the truth reflected here is even more terrifying</p><p>After Lovecraft Country’s first episode aired a fortnight ago, most of you here on the blog seemed to agree with my rave review. Still, scepticism abounded in the comments over two points in particular: 1) the extent to which Jim Crow-style segregation and brutal racism existed in the US’s northern states during the period; and 2) whether the monsters put the frighteners up us as much as a true horror fan expects, nay <em>demands</em>.</p><p>The third episode, Holy Ghost, offers up definitive answers on both points. This haunted house tale was the scariest yet, due to some spectacularly realised ghouls and because of the many ominous nods to real historical cases of redlining, unethical medical experimentation and lynchings. After three weeks of doing background research for these recaps, I’m learning that however outrageous an aspect of Lovecraft Country’s fictionalised racism may seem, there’s almost always a comparable real event from US history that many times worse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/31/lovecraft-country-recap-season-one-episode-three-i-got-you-kid-hbo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This common condition can lead to relationship breakdown and unnecessary surgery. So why is treatment still so poor and underfunded? </p><p>I was just a few weeks into a new relationship when the pain started. Whenever my boyfriend and I started to have penetrative sex, it felt as if there were razor blades inside me. At first I laughed it off, but soon I became terrified of intercourse. My body would freeze with fear as my clothes came off. By the time we said: “I love you,” even kissing made me feel anxious. I would spend entire day trips and holidays with him worrying about the pain.</p><p>When I first went to my GP, the advice I got was to “try and relax”. It was about as helpful as telling someone having a panic attack to “just chill out”. Without a real solution, I started to question whether I was imagining the pain. Or if maybe, somehow, I was to blame for it. My boyfriend was kind and supportive but I felt I was letting him down. Some days, I would feel so ashamed that it was hard to think about anything else. Other days, I’d feel an overwhelming sense of loss for the carefree woman I had been.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/31/pain-vaginismus-destroys-lives-misunderstood-common-conditions-surgery-treatment">Continue reading...</a>

Many of these systems will be installed in Amazon warehouses to monitor the heat signatures of employees and alert managers if workers exhibit Covid-19-like symptoms. Other cameras included in the shipment will be distributed to IBM and Chrysler, among other buyers.</p><p>While Amazon’s move to protect workers from Covid-19 is welcome, it acquired this technology from a company <a href="https://chinatechmap.aspi.org.au/#/company/dahua">researchers have shown</a> is <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/04/29/amazon-bought-cameras-from-chinese-company-on-u-s-blacklist-to-screen-for-coronavirus/">involved in human rights abuses</a>.

Her first children’s book, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/human-journey-9781405291453.html">Human Journey</a>, a story of ancestral migration, will be published this week, while a “much bigger book”, Ancestors: A History of Britain in Thirteen Burials, going back to the depths of the Ice Age, is due out in early 2021.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/31/alice-roberts-atheism-humanism">Continue reading...</a>

## Smoked out: why me and a million other people have given up nicotine in 2020

<p>My lifelong love affair with cigarettes was so intense I could only have smoked more if I had slept less. But smashing my vape kit was the final straw </p><p>One million cigarette smokers <a href="http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical/clinical-specialties/smoking-cessation/one-million-smokers-quit-during-covid-lockdown-research-suggests/20041162.article">have apparently given up</a> since the start of lockdown. It’s like a massacre. (OK, arguably, the massacre is what would have happened if they had not given up.) I didn’t even know there were that many smokers left. The youngest were most likely to quit – about one in six of the 16- to 29-year-olds, which is coupled with the endearing hypothesis that a lot of them moved temporarily back in with their parents, who didn’t have a clue about their habit.</p><p>Anyway, if I had known about this, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/24/coronavirus-smoking-cigarettes-danger-covid-19">I never would have given up vaping</a>. I hate feeling like a cliche. I hate it so much that this might be the excuse I need to take it up again, except that’s how everything feels. If I see a single crow fly past, I imagine what sad thing might happen that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/18/the-great-vape-debate-are-e-cigarettes-saving-smokers-or-creating-new-addicts">might justify my vaping again</a>. If I see an elderly lady smoking a fag outside a restaurant, I think: “I should get a vape and go join her, in a gesture of sisterhood. Otherwise she might feel judged.” The pathetic inventiveness of my addiction is taking up so much of my brain that I’m surprised when other things work, such as that I’m still able to read. I just really, really love nicotine, and I have done since I was 14, which is a really, really long time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/31/smoked-million-people-nicotine-cigarettes-vape-kit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the dinner lady retraining as a nurse, to the credit controller with her eyes on midwifery, coronavirus has encouraged many to follow their dreams of a caring career</p><p>It wasn’t that Zeta Annear didn’t like being a dinner lady. The children were lovely and the school felt like a community. It was straightforward work – because her school was small, all Annear had to do was collect cooked food from a nearby, bigger school, dish it out, then wash up. But the 39-year-old mother of three from Cornwall always felt as if something was missing. “I felt like I wasn’t using my brain whatsoever,” Annear says. “As much as I loved the teachers, the children and the people, I needed more.”</p><p>Annear has wanted to be a nurse since she was a child. Her desire to work in healthcare was reignited when she lost her daughter Sophie, who was stillborn, in 2010. “My midwife was absolutely phenomenal ... even though I was going through the most horrendous experience ever, she made me feel like everything was OK,” Annear says. “Ever since then, I have wanted to be the person who made someone feel like things were OK.” But life always got in the way; Annear’s husband is in the navy, so he is often away, and she needed a job that fitted around the kids.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/aug/31/in-good-health-meet-the-people-who-have-quit-their-jobs-to-join-the-nhs">Continue reading...</a>
