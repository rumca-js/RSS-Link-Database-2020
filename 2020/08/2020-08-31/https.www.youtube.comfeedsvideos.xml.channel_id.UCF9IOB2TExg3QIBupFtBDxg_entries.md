Cloth masks are a simple, economic and sustainable alternative to surgical masks as a means of source control of SARS-CoV-2 in the general community

Mask wearers are dramatically less likely to get a severe case of Covid-19

No mask is perfect

Wearing one might not prevent you from getting infected

But it might be the difference between a case of Covid-19 that sends you to the hospital and a case so mild you don’t even realize you’re infected.

Universal masking reduces the “inoculum” 

Leading to more mild and asymptomatic infection manifestations

Masks, depending on type, filter out the majority of viral particles, but not all

Viral inoculum and severity of disease (LD50)

Rising rates of asymptomatic infection with population-level masking

Increased with mask wearing, decreased where few masks are worn

So, more asymptomatic infections

Greater community-level immunity and slower spread

The point is not that some particles can penetrate but that some particles are stopped

Every virus-laden particle retained in a mask is not available to hang in the air as an aerosol or fall to a surface to be later picked up by touch.

Cloth can block droplets and aerosols, and layers add efficiency.

Immunity and immunopathology to viruses: what decides the outcome? (Nature, Reviews Immunology)

https://www.nature.com/articles/nri2802

The outcome of host–viral interactions depend on

Dose and route of infection

Viral virulence properties

Several host factors that mainly involve innate and adaptive immunity

If the exposure dose is very high, the immune response can become overwhelmed.

If the initial dose of the virus is small, the immune system is able to contain the virus with less drastic measures.

If this happens, fewer symptoms, if any

Of all deaths registered as COVID-19 related in the UK

17,127 (31%) occurred within care homes

At least 21,775 (40%) were care home residents

It will never be possible to unequivocally assign care home deaths during the pandemic to COVID-19 or other causes

Excess deaths data is next best thing
