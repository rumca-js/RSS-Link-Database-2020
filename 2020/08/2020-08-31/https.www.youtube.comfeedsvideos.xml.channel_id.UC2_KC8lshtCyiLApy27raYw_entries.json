It\u2019s not every month, or every year. But sometimes, just sometimes, a masterpiece is never made. Does that make sense? No. And neither do these movies.\n\nJoin me as I venture forth the swamp that is Disney live action films of the 2000s. An era of unprecedented creativity, and uh, failure. A time where animals talked and pirates sailed, but best of all, the country bears.\nIt\u2019s gonna be a bumpy ride.\n\nTwitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/KnowledgeHubTy\n\nSoundcloud:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-503704039\n\nPatreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/theknowledgehub\n\nSecond Channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-KL04Ra6E1Du0pFawN4pWg\n\nSpotify:\nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/3STpelEilrthF8UxsQTaaw?si=52TH_ZKTQhaKhfnK1Jomfg\n\nMy website:\nwww.borfed.com\n\nAdditional footage credits:\nLMG Vids\nRetroWDW\nSoCal Attractions 360\nDisney Shopaholic\nThePresidentialTourist\nTheme Park Worldwide", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FbVcQXSv2U", "date_published": "2020-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
