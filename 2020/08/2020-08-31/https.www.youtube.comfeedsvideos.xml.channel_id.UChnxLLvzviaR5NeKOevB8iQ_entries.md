Braids and Plaits are both digital macro Eurorack oscillators from Mutable Instruments. They're both excellent, but what makes them different? Let's find out.

Here are some differences I missed!
* Plaits shares no hardware or software with Braids!
* Floating-point DSP code written from scratch or inherited from Elements, Warps and Rings.
* Band-limited synthesis used almost everywhere, producing aliasing-free results at the base sample rate of 48kHz (Braids ran at 96kHz and used naive oversampling).
* High-quality Sigma-Delta ADC for CV acquisition, approaching a resolution of 16-bit (12-bit for Braids).
* ADC reads are interpolated in software to eliminate zipper noise.
* DC-coupled audio output, extending the range of the module to very low frequencies (Braids could not reach LFO ranges).
* Lean hardware design: less HP, mA and â‚¬
