Coronavirus vaccine: Short cuts and allegations of dirty tricks in race to be first

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-53864069

In this race, accusations of short-cuts, espionage, unethical risk-taking, jealousy, vaccine nationalism

Lawrence Gostin, Professor, Georgetown University

The reason the Covid-19 vaccine has taken on such political symbolism is that the superpowers have seen the vaccine as projecting their scientific prowess, actually validating their political system as superior

July

UK, US and Canada accused Russia's spy agencies of hacking into vaccine research, stealing data

Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program, Council on Foreign Relations

There have been short cuts taken for sure, particularly in the Russian case

Testing within the military

 Locking up large initial doses of supplies of vaccines

Dr Tedros, 18th August

Richer countries should join a global programme to share vaccines with poorer nations
We need to prevent vaccine nationalism

Recommending against testing for antibodies in first 1 to 2 weeks after exposure

Sweet spot, 3 to 4 weeks after exposure

47 published studies, in the first 2 weeks, many have not yet developed antibodies

Best to use IgG test or a total antibody test 3 to 4 weeks after the onset of symptoms

Most people remain susceptible to this virus

No country can just ride this out until we have a vaccine

A vaccine will be a vital tool

New impetus to the need to accelerate efforts to respond to climate change

The pandemic has given us a glimpse of our world as it could be: cleaner skies and rivers. 

Building back better means building back greener
