Maybe this is harsh on Leach and Bess who are early in their Test careers but are there any others on the circuit who could break through?” Good question. Most of the wickets taken by spin in county cricket seem to go to Simon Harmer. But Leach may well be the real deal. And don’t forget Moeen, who is mercurial but incisive, even against expert players of spin. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/aug/22/england-v-pakistan-third-test-day-two-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rajat Jindal fell in love with gardening as a child, but it was only when he bought a tiny thatched cottage later in life that he could finally indulge his passion</p><p>There is a photograph of me, aged four or five, pushing a lawnmower, wearing smart, red, leather shoes. It was taken at our home in Durham, about a year before my father died. Although it’s clearly a posed shot, I like to think it shows an early interest in gardening.</p><p>My parents had emigrated from India in 1955. Following my father’s death in 1967, it was assumed my mother would return with me and my brother. Instead, she immersed herself in her work as a doctor and in gardening. By 1972, we were living in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, with half an acre of land.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/22/a-gardening-career-was-not-what-was-expected-of-me-one-mans-journey-from-law-to-lawn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s a lot to love in this drama about a celebrity whose messy life is further upended by scandal, but brace yourselves for some song-and-dance numbers</p><p>Two things happen in episode one of I Hate Suzie (Thursday, 9pm, Sky Atlantic) that will shape how you feel about the show overall and, I think, actually quite neatly divide humanity in general: Billie Piper has diarrhoea, and then, later on, sings. What are you? A diarrhoea person? Or a singing person? No one, I think, is both.</p><p>First the diarrhoea, I suppose: Billie Piper, or rather Suzie, has it, in a panic, in the middle of a highly stressful photoshoot. The sort-of premise of I Hate Suzie is: a celebrity famous for a singing career in her teens and a sci-fi acting career in her 20s – you can’t see it but I’m looking to camera incredibly knowingly right now, in a way I would even go so far as to describe as “annoying” – has her nudes leaked in a tabloid scandal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/22/i-hate-suzie-billie-piper-lets-rip-as-a-phone-hacked-actor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>During lockdown, there have been horror stories of neighbours reporting each other over small acts of kindness or comfort. Her new novel Summerwater asks: do we still recognise enough common humanity to save each other?</p><p>I published <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jun/20/cold-earth-sarah-moss-review">my first novel</a>, <em>Cold Earth</em>, which is set during an epidemic, on the day the World Health Organization declared avian flu to be a pandemic. I hadn’t, of course, predicted that particular disease, but the story of pestilence, like those of war and famine, is always in the offing, and you don’t have to know much to understand that humans’ destruction of animal habitats keeps us at constant risk of zoonotic viruses. The story was there before the disease had a name.</p><p>My seventh novel, <em>Summerwater</em>, was written before Covid-19. I was surprised by how many people asked me if I had to make last-minute changes, asked if it would be impossible or even irresponsible to promote a book in which people go dancing or share food or hug now those pleasures are forbidden. It didn’t occur to me to want to change anything. After all, the novels of the 1930s are more, not less, precious for their innocence of what is to come, for their glamorous journeys and lavish parties, and also for their dawning horror. The stories of that growing dismay are important as well as beautiful: what did readers and writers see and what could they not imagine? How does literature meet, or fail to recognise, war (or plague or famine)? Novels speak of their moment but the good ones don’t go off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/22/love-thy-neighbour-sarah-moss-on-the-darker-side-of-community-in-a-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

It was a remarkably concise and much admired novel that was nominated for the 2017 Man Booker International prize, and focused on the small world of the island in the 1910s and 20s; in the subsequent books, the outside world creeps in and is confronted by Ingrid head on.</p><p>The second instalment, <em>White Shadow </em>, is set during the last year of the second world war: refugees from the northern province of Finnmark arrive, collaborators abuse their power, and Russian prisoner of war Alexander, having survived the sinking of the MS Rigel, lands on Barrøy. Ingrid falls in love with the young man and hides him from Nazis and collaborators until he is strong enough to embark on a trek to neutral Sweden. In <em>Eyes of the Rigel</em> Ingrid sets out across a postwar country in search of the father of her 10-month-old daughter. Ingrid’s only mementos of her lover are her daughter’s eyes, as black as Alexander’s, and a note in Russian, which a neighbour helps her decipher: it says, “I love you” nine times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/22/eyes-of-the-rigel-by-roy-jacobsen-review-secrets-in-postwar-norway">Continue reading...</a>

In the case of actor-director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1541272/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Amy Seimetz</a>, however, it’s not just her living room wallpaper that’s made its way into the public realm. Like many, I have become intimately acquainted with practically every nook and cranny of her compact, pleasingly neutral LA abode (when she briefly pauses our chat to let the plumber in, I can visualise her front door in my head, clear as day). For once, the weirdness isn’t pandemic-related – it’s because Seimetz’s house doubles as the set of her new film, She Dies Tomorrow, a psychological horror about anxiety, contagion and our relationship with our own mortality.</p><p>If you think shooting a horror film in your house and subsequently being trapped there alone for months on end during a global pandemic might have disturbing knock-on effects, think again. “Through film-making I learned to love my house!” says Seimetz, who claims that prior to the shoot she “didn’t know what to do with” her new home. “Because I treat atmosphere in my movies like a character, the house now is a living being to me. It’s not just that I love the house, I feel like the house loves me.” She pauses. “I don’t really, I’m not crazy. Or maybe a little bit.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/22/she-dies-tomorrow-director-amy-seimetz-on-accidentally-making-a-covid-horror-film">Continue reading...</a>

Being around good food most of my working day has made me so, but, having always been a curious eater, I guess it all started at a very young age. Recently, however, the simple fact that my eyes are bigger than my stomach, plus the price that I pay around my waistline every time I bite into something tempting, has forced me to reconsider my snacking habits. So humour me while I engage in a bit of wishful thinking, imagining the perfect snacks, prepared with attention and much thought, and consumed only when it’s right and proper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/22/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-late-summer-snacksgarlic-anchovy-dip-polenta-crisps-tapenade-coconut-coffee-bars">Continue reading...</a>

## Grace Dent's guide to post-lockdown eating out: 'I can now emote happy, sad and “can I get the bill” in a face mask’

<p>For months, our restaurant critic craved a boozy night out with friends. Fifteen attempts later, she’s ready to share her advice<br /></p><p>On the WhatsApp group I used as a life-support system during lockdown, a recurring fantasy kept us going in the days when online Scrabble and swapping tips on sourcing hand gel could not: a dream of doughballs. When all this blows over, my friends and I agreed, we’ll go to Pizza Express. Midweek, table for four, Sloppy Giuseppes, numerous warm bottles of Gavi di Gavi. We’ll laugh about this one day, we said, weakly, as the chat flickered between closed schools, locked-down care homes, skipped chemo and the loneliness of isolation. It was never really about the doughballs; they represented a former carefree life.</p><p>When every restaurant in Britain closed, from high street to haute cuisine, many of us suddenly saw what eating together gives us. This was true even for me, someone who eats out for a living, and who in the first few weeks enjoyed the break. But there’s a joy and a rhythm in sitting with others, sipping, nibbling and laughing – one you’ll never get from an ever-flickering chat app. Eating together is where actual life happens. Miles away from my family, I missed desperately the way my brother David side-orders jalapeños on everything and refuses to share pudding. I missed stabbing away at his sticky toffee pudding with a spoon, quacking, “You’re worse now than when you were a child!” because we’ve done this for more than 40 years. I longed to sit in peaceable silence with my teenage niece, Lola, as she ogles TikTok from behind a McNugget box. If restaurants could just reopen, I thought, the world would feel sane again. But then they did, and for the first few meals I felt worse. Six weeks later, here’s what I’ve learned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/22/grace-dents-guide-to-post-lockdown-eating-out-i-can-now-emote-happy-sad-and-can-i-get-the-bill-in-a-face-mask">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just the thought of sitting on a plane makes my hypochondriac heart beat triple time. But I don’t want to hear about anyone’s fabulous time in Patmos</p><p>Unlike <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/01/gore-vidal-best-quotes" title="">Gore Vidal</a>, I do not need my friends to fail so that I can enjoy my successes. But it is the law that if I am doing nothing, then my friends must be equally bored, too. For those of us who suffer from acute Fomo, AKA fear of missing out (to paraphrase <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/willferrell?view=mobile" title="">Will Ferrell</a> on sex addiction, it’s a real disease, <a href="https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/954f58cf-ea4c-40fd-9af4-e441d4000607" title="">with doctors and medicine and everything!</a>), lockdown was, well, I don’t want to say it was good, because obviously it was terrible. But it was also, on the most base and selfish level possible, a bit of a relief.</p><p>No longer was I plagued with the constant tinnitus-like buzzing in my brain telling me that something better was happening elsewhere, that everyone was having fun without me. It’s a terrible affliction, one that once propelled me from a wedding in Sussex at midnight to a 40th birthday in Suffolk, and to a 50th birthday party in Ipswich the day before I gave birth. Insane? Possibly. But I didn’t miss out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/22/i-dont-want-to-go-abroad-why-am-i-seething-mass-of-envy">Continue reading...</a>

## 'The risk is enormous': UK live music still in crisis after reopening

<p>One week on from concert venues being allowed to reopen, social distancing means that very few have been able to do so, leading to calls for further government support</p><p>For singer-songwriter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/14/frank-turner-review-big-hearted-anthems-and-love-songs-to-america">Frank Turner</a>, an audience singalong is one of the most affecting parts of his live show. For his return to the stage on the day the UK government allowed venues to reopen last weekend, though, he had to try a different tack. “The audience were not supposed to sing along,” he says, because of the danger of coronavirus being spread. “If the crowd started to kick off I had to politely tell them to calm down, which really goes against my performance instincts. I even tried to get a ‘hum-along’ going at one point.”</p><p>Infectious viruses and hum-alongs are just two of the issues currently facing the live music industry. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/coronavirus-theatres-music-venues-and-beauty-salons-in-england-to-reopen">announcement</a> from the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, last Friday meant indoor concert venues could once again put on shows – delayed from a planned 1 August reopening. Today, the government announced the 135 recipients of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/25/english-music-venues-to-receive-emergency-pandemic-aid-covid-19">emergency fund</a> to help grassroots venues. But with social distancing requiring tricky logistics and limiting box-office takings, very few venues have yet opened their doors. Mark Davyd, head of the charity Music Venue Trust, <a href="https://www.musicweek.com/live/read/indoor-gigs-given-green-light-to-return-in-uk-with-social-distancing/080784">warned last week</a> that “only around 100 of the country’s 900 small music venues would be able to operate under the current restrictions”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/22/the-risk-is-enormous-uk-live-music-still-in-crisis-after-reopening">Continue reading...</a>

## Streaming: great horror films with a political undercurrent

<p>Riveting Guatemalan drama La Llorona, premiering on Shudder, continues a rich tradition of horror with a political message, from Night of the Living Dead to Get Out</p><p>As cinemas tentatively reopen, many of the year’s best films continue to forsake them in favour of streaming – sometimes popping up in highly unpredictable places. If you aren’t a hardcore devotee of horror film, chances are you don’t have a subscription to<a href="https://www.shudder.com/?gclid=CjwKCAjw1ej5BRBhEiwAfHyh1KjsrnZdwgWAhC3LK17mWV6fHSZqEs7yW7Mp-Bgp3SfJokqusMSv7RoCZtMQAvD_BwE"> Shudder</a>, a fine genre platform with programming that often stretches beyond the expected slash-and-scream territory. If so, you’re missing out on a remarkable new film from Guatemala that is <a href="https://www.shudder.com/movies/watch/la-llorona/0bdaa1df0ad05cc0?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqqa_qpGi6wIVjevtCh3FSAsIEAAYASAAEgL0FvD_BwE">exclusively streaming there</a>. Much acclaimed on the festival circuit last year, Jayro Bustamante’s <strong>La Llorona</strong> may burrow under your skin with unsettling atmospherics, but it has as much to offer arthouse patrons as it does horrorheads in its adherence to a tradition of horror cinema with a real-world political undercurrent.</p><p>Bustamante’s 2015 debut,<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJfvKnLPqFM&amp;list=PL11D0654B4161B589&amp;index=77&amp;t=0s"> Ixcanul</a>, </em>sadly never released in the UK, was a delicately transporting sociological study of indigenous community. <em>La Llorona</em> takes broader, more aggressive stylistic swings, while remaining sensitively embedded in local culture and horrific history. Bustamante’s film is rooted in the eponymous Latin American legend of the Weeping Woman, the restless, mourning ghost of a mother who drowned her children. Here, though, the fable has been cleverly adapted to represent the trauma of Guatemala’s Mayan genocide of the 1980s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/22/streaming-the-best-political-horror-films-la-llorona-guatemala-shudder">Continue reading...</a>

## Disclosure: dance music’s superstars on cultural appropriation

<p>After five years away, dance’s superstar duo have returned with a re-energising new album. They explain why they no longer fear nightclubs and why farming is the future</p><p>And so a summer has passed without a single tent unwittingly erected next to an all-night soundsystem, a single wristband being slipped off and passed back, a single bottle of supermarket vodka decanted into a bottle of mineral water. This has been our first year without dance festivals or open nightclubs since the second summer of love (although there has been a surge of illegal lockdown raves). Even as aspects of normal life return, the one thing most Brits haven’t done since early 2020 is dance with one another.</p><p>So while it makes sense that Taylor Swift would release an album of folky introspection during this time, it seems almost perverse that Disclosure, whose whole rave-on d’être is to headline festivals in home counties woodland, or come on at 3am at an Ibiza superclub, would choose this moment to release their first album in five years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/22/disclosure-when-youre-15-a-club-is-a-pretty-terrifying-place">Continue reading...</a>
