But calling for \u2018competent\u2019 rule is not a rival programme for office</p><p>This government is a shambles. More and more people say so: not just Keir Starmer but Tory backbenchers, not just <a href=\"https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/piers-morgan-slams-boris-johnsons-18231333\">Piers Morgan</a> but the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/58dcbfaa-740f-4747-8240-bc5ffb412e67\">Financial Times</a>, not just leftists on Twitter but the <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-8174007/DAILY-MAIL-COMMENT-testing-shambles-unforgivable-ministers-act.html\">Daily Mail</a>. The list of Boris Johnson\u2019s failures \u2013 over coronavirus and in just about every other policy area \u2013 gets longer every week. Ministers are objects of mockery and contempt.</p><p>Government incompetence matters, especially during a pandemic. But it\u2019s also an easy charge to make \u2013 almost too easy. It comes naturally to disillusioned voters, who don\u2019t trust politicians anyway; to civil servants, with scores to settle after government cuts; and to journalists, who enjoy judging the powerful and describing Whitehall meltdowns.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/22/boris-johnson-government-incompetent-prime-minister-competent\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/22/boris-johnson-government-incompetent-prime-minister-competent", "date_published": "2020-08-22 07:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'I'm up for the fight': Chris Jackson to be first black scientist to give Christmas lecture", "description": "<p>Professor urges organisations to help tackle racism, misogyny and transphobia</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/22/covid-climate-change-royal-institution-christmas-lectures-planet-earth-users-guide-pandemic\">Covid v climate change: Royal Institution Christmas lectures on chance to reset Earth</a></li></ul><p>Prof Chris Jackson, who this year will be the first black person to present the Royal Institution Christmas lectures, has said such organisations have a key role to play in addressing issues including racism and transphobia.</p><p>Jackson is one of three UK academics presenting this year\u2019s lectures, called Planet Earth: A User\u2019s Guide.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/22/christmas-lectures-first-black-presenter-chris-jackson\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/22/christmas-lectures-first-black-presenter-chris-jackson", "date_published": "2020-08-22 06:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "After a repentant Trump voter's one-man protest, what happened next?", "description": "<p>James Walker took a stand in March 2017 that provoked an overwhelming response online and also within his family</p><p>Regrets, he\u2019s had a few, but then again, there\u2019s one he\u2019d like to mention.</p><p>James Walker voted for Donald Trump in 2016.
