Belgium, not Dutch. Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine Therapy and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Observational Study of 8075 Participants (International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, 24 August)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303423

Background

Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been largely used and investigated as therapy of COVID-19 , at total dose usually ranging from 2400 mg to 9600 mg.

In Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (2400 mg in total over five days) was recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

“low-dose” regimen of HCQ sulphate in monotherapy 

400mg twice on day 1

200mg twice a day from day 2 to 5

i.e. a total dose of 2400 mg

Methods

Multi-centric design 

Vast majority of Belgian hospitals

Retrospective analysis

In-hospital mortality in Belgium

40 day follow up

No difference in the baseline characteristics

Groups

HCQ alone and supportive care

Supportive care only

Adjusted for demographic and clinical features

Results

8075 patients with complete discharge data

HCQ group, n = 4,542

Deaths, 804, (17.7%)

no-HCQ group, n = 3,533

Deaths, 957 (27.1%)

Multivariable analysis

Mortality was lower in the HCQ group compared to the no-HCQ group 

Hazard ratio = 0.684

Estimated direct-adjusted mortality at 40 days 

19.1% with HCQ alone

26.5% with supportive care only

Mortality in the HCQ group was reduced

Both in patients diagnosed in less than 5 days and more than 5 days

Conclusions

Compared to supportive care only, low-dose HCQ monotherapy was independently associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated early or later after symptom onset.

Hydroxychloroquine group, n = 1,561

Usual care group, n = 3,155 

Patients allocated to hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200mg) received a loading dose of 4 tablets (800 mg) at zero and 6 hours, followed by 2 tablets (400 mg) starting at 12 hours after the initial dose and then every 12 hours for the next 9 days

9,200 mg over 10 days

Conclusion

In patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality

Was associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death

METHODS

55 hospitals, Brazil

Randomized

Open label

Three-group

Controlled

Patients

667 patients, 504 confirmed Covid-19

Receiving no supplemental oxygen

Or a maximum of 4 liters per minute 

1:1:1

Standard care n = 229

Standard care plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily) n = 221

Standard care plus hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg once 
daily for 7 days) n = 277

RESULTS

No difference in need for ventilation, deaths, thromboembolic complications, AKI

Clinical status at 15 days

As compared with standard care = 1

Hydroxychloroquine alone, odds ratio, 1.21

Hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, odds ratio, 0.99

HCQ Group

Prolongation of the corrected QT interval and 

Elevation of liver-enzyme levels

CONCLUSIONS
Among patients hospitalized with mild-to-moderate Covid-19, the use of hydroxychloroquine, alone or with azithromycin, did not improve clinical status at 15 days as compared with standard care.

Full version with evidence to follow. This is important as it explains why we have a pandemic in the first place and how transmission will play out over the next months. While deaths rates are thankfully low in many areas now, there is a real risk they will rise steeply with the onset of colder weather.

I think the CDC have changed their testing guidelines in order to prevent the virus being spread by people with a negative test result. This is because people who test negative could go on to test positive in the next few days. This is important as people are most infectious in the day or two immediately before and after the onset of symptoms.
Proportion of asymptomatic coronavirus disease 2019: A systematic review and meta‐analysis (Journal of Medical Virology, 21 July)

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.26326

Meta Analysis

N = 50, 155 

41 studies

Asymptomatic, confirmed COVID‐19

Overall pooled data

15.6% are asymptomatic

84.4 are symptomatic

Asymptomatics in children

N = 1, 152

11 studies

27.7% asymptomatic

72.3 symptomatic

Nearly half of the patients with no symptoms at detection time will develop symptoms later

48.9% of asymptomatic go on to become symptomatic

Asymptomatic COVID‐19 patients could have abnormal laboratory and radiational manifestations

Which can be used as screening strategies to identify asymptomatic infection.

CT results in asymptomatics

N = 36

4 studies

63% had an abnormal CT

Reduced white blood cell count, 27%

Increases lymphocyte count

Increased lactate dehydrogenase, 42.3%

Increased C‐reactive protein, 11.5%

Clinical Course and Molecular Viral Shedding Among Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in a Community Treatment Center in the Republic of Korea

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2769235

Aim

To quantitatively describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular viral shedding in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients

Method

Cohort study

n =  303

Isolated in a community treatment center in Korea

Results

110 (36.3%) were asymptomatic at the time of isolation

21 of these (19.1%) developed symptoms during isolation

Time from detection of SARS-CoV-2 to symptom onset in presymptomatic patients was 15 (13-20) days

Time from diagnosis to the first negative conversion

Asymptomatic, 17 days

Symptomatic, 19.5 days

Viral loads, same

Meaning 

Many individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection remained asymptomatic for a prolonged period

Viral load was similar to that in symptomatic patients

Isolation of infected persons should be performed regardless of symptoms

Temporal dynamics in viral shedding and transmissibility of COVID-19 (Nature medicine, 17th August)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0869-5

94 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19

Estimated that 44% of secondary cases were infected during the index cases’ presymptomatic stage

Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial presymptomatic transmission.

The implications of silent transmission for the control of COVID-19 outbreaks (PNAS – US, 28th July)

https://www.pnas.org/content/117/30/17513

If 17.9% of infections are asymptomatic

Presymptomatic transmission, 48% of transmission

Asymptomatic transmission, 3.4% of transmission

Even immediate isolation of all symptomatic cases is insufficient to achieve control 

Urgent need to scale up testing of suspected cases

Supplemented by rapid contact-based surveillance to identify exposed individuals 
prior to their infectious period

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/testing-overview.html

Considerations for COVID-19 Diagnostic (Molecular or Antigen) Testing

Mild symptoms of COVID-19

Your health care provider may advise a test.

If you test positive or do not get tested, self-isolate for at least 10 days after symptom onset

And at least 24 hours after the resolution of any fever (without the use of fever-reducing medications)

If you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms

You do not necessarily need a test, unless in a vulnerable group

Or

Health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one

A negative test does not mean you will not develop an infection from the close contact or contract an infection at a later time

You should monitor yourself for symptoms

If you do not have COVID-19 symptoms and have not been in close contact with someone known to have a COVID-19 infection:

You do not need a test.

If you are in a high COVID-19 transmission area and have attended a public or private gathering of more than 10 people (without widespread mask wearing or physical distancing)

You do not necessarily need a test

Live or work in a care facility

You will need to be tested

Critical infrastructure worker, health care worker, or first responder

You may need to get a test, according to your employer’s guidelines.
