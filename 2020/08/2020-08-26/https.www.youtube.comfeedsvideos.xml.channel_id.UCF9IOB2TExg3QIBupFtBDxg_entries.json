Low-dose Hydroxychloroquine Therapy and Mortality in Hospitalized Patients with COVID-19: A Nationwide Observational Study of 8075 Participants (International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, 24 August)\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924857920303423\n\nBackground\n\nHydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been largely used and investigated as therapy of COVID-19 , at total dose usually ranging from 2400 mg to 9600 mg.\n\nIn Belgium, off-label use of low-dose HCQ (2400 mg in total over five days) was recommended for hospitalized patients with COVID-19.\n\n\u201clow-dose\u201d regimen of HCQ sulphate in monotherapy \n\n400mg twice on day 1\n\n200mg twice a day from day 2 to 5\n\ni.e. a total dose of 2400 mg\n\nMethods\n\nMulti-centric design \n\nVast majority of Belgian hospitals\n\nRetrospective analysis\n\nIn-hospital mortality in Belgium\n\n40 day follow up\n\nNo difference in the baseline characteristics\n\nGroups\n\nHCQ alone and supportive care\n\nSupportive care only\n\nAdjusted for demographic and clinical features\n\nResults\n\n8075 patients with complete discharge data\n\nHCQ group, n = 4,542\n\nDeaths, 804, (17.7%)\n\nno-HCQ group, n = 3,533\n\nDeaths, 957 (27.1%)\n\nMultivariable analysis\n\nMortality was lower in the HCQ group compared to the no-HCQ group \n\nHazard ratio = 0.684\n\nEstimated direct-adjusted mortality at 40 days \n\n19.1% with HCQ alone\n\n26.5% with supportive care only\n\nMortality in the HCQ group was reduced\n\nBoth in patients diagnosed in less than 5 days and more than 5 days\n\nConclusions\n\nCompared to supportive care only, low-dose HCQ monotherapy was independently associated with lower mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 diagnosed and treated early or later after symptom onset.\n\nOther positive studies\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477893920302817?via%3Dihub\n\nRisk Factors for Mortality in Patients with COVID-19 in New York

group, n = 3,155 \n\nPatients allocated to hydroxychloroquine sulfate (200mg) received a loading dose of 4 tablets (800 mg) at zero and 6 hours, followed by 2 tablets (400 mg) starting at 12 hours after the initial dose and then every 12 hours for the next 9 days\n\n9,200 mg over 10 days\n\nConclusion\n\nIn patients hospitalized with COVID-19, hydroxychloroquine was not associated with reductions in 28-day mortality\n\nWas associated with an increased length of hospital stay and increased risk of progressing to invasive mechanical ventilation or death \n\nWHO-led

277\n\nRESULTS\n\nNo difference in need for ventilation, deaths, thromboembolic complications, AKI\n\nClinical status at 15 days\n\nAs compared with standard care = 1\n\nHydroxychloroquine alone, odds ratio, 1.21\n\nHydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, odds ratio, 0.99\n\nHCQ Group\n\nProlongation of the corrected QT interval and \n\nElevation of liver-enzyme levels\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients
