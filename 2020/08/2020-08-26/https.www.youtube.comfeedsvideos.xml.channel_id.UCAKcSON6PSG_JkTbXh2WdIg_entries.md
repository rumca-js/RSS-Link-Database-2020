Old 97's have been rocking it since 1993, and just last Friday, they released their 12th studio album, appropriately entitled "Twelfth," on ATO Records. The band's alt-country-inflected brand of power pop is largely defined by the lyrics of frontman Rhett Miller, who during this time of pandemic, has continued to engage fans multiple times per week by performing virtual gigs on StageIt. In honor of the Old 97's' latest album, here's a 2011 performance recorded in The Current studio as well as a Rhett Miller solo performance from the Wits radio program in 2014.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Every Night Is Friday Night (Without You)" (2011)
2:41 "Four Leaf Clover" (2014)

PERSONNEL
Rhett Miller – vocals, guitar
Murry Hammond – bass, vocals
Ken Bethea – lead guitar, vocals 
Philip Peeples – drums, vocals
