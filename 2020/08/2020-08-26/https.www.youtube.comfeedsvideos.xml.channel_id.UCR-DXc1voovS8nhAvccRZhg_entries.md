What's so exciting about the High Quality camera for the Raspberry Pi? I'll start exploring what makes it different than the older Camera Module v2, and why you might want to use itâ€”or not!

Some of the adapters and devices mentioned in the video:

Fotodiox Pro Nikon F-mount adapter: https://amzn.to/2YBARko
Astromania T-Mount adapter for telescopes: https://amzn.to/3jmE53j
Tamron 6mm f/1.4 CCTV lens: https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1106082-REG/tamron_m118fm06_m118fm6_1_1_8_c_mount_6mm.html (mine is 8mm, but it's discontinued)

I bought my HQ camera from Adafruit, and the mount I'm using to attach it to my Raspberry Pi 4 is from The Pi Hut: https://thepihut.com/products/mounting-plate-for-high-quality-camera?variant=31867507114046
