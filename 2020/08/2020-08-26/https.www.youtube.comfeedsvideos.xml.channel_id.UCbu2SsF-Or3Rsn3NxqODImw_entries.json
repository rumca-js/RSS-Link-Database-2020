The in-game event in Warzone showed the full trailer after players completed the special mission and made it to the stadium. We know now that Cold War will be a direct sequel to Black Ops 1 and will take place mostly in the 80s. You will play as your own customizable character, play open-ended missions, side objectives, and more in the campaign. For multiplayer, the game will be cross-platform and cross-gen, Zombies are back to some extent, and Warzone will continue once the release of Cold War. \n\nPersia also talks about the surprise Nintendo Direct Mini that released this morning that showcased various third-party games coming to the Switch. Among the games announced, a few were Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory and Puyo Puyo Tetris 2. Melody of Memory is a rhythm game where you battle to the beat of songs from the entire series, revisit iconic scenes, and more. Puyo Puyo Tetris 2 is returning with the same cross-over style as the first title but is adding a new card-based skill battle mode and a new story. \n\nLastly, Persia talks about the recent announcement that Fall Guys has become the most downloaded game on PlayStation Plus ever. Devolver Digital announced that the game also crossed the 7 million unit mark on Steam alone. More content updates are already planned for the future of Fall Guys and it Season 2 outline will be revealed on the opening night of Gamescom.\n\nBe sure to check out store.gamespot.com to get some merch and support Black Lives Matters and Covid 19 relief efforts.

Original (Gameplay Comparison)", "description": "Mafia: Definitive Edition is a complete remake of the original 2002 game. Sporting new graphics, a revised story, and updated gameplay that puts it on par with Mafia III, this remake captures what made the original game such a standout experience, while also modernizing it for today's age. Developer Hanger 13 has been working on the Definitive Edition since 2017, and with the September release, this revisit to the original story will round out the current iteration of the Mafia trilogy, which recently saw remasters for both Mafia II and III.\n\nIn this gameplay video, we're taking a detailed look at how the Definitive Edition revitalizes the story of Tommy Angelo and his rise to power within the Salieri crime family in the city of Lost Heaven. It's a substantial rework of the game, and we show off a side-by-side with some of the opening's key scenes to display how the remake updated the original. Right from the beginning of our three hours of hands-on time with the game, it became apparent that this remake wasn't just a simple remaster. Many of the game's most iconic moments have been recreated to heighten the tension, and even give some of the supporting cast more time to shine.  \n\nMafia: Definitive Edition will release on September 25 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. Along with our hands-on impressions with the game, go check out our interview with game director Haden Blackman about how they remade the original game. Be sure to check back with GameSpot next month for our full review of the game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k08QmqRPKEk", "date_published": "2020-08-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Nintendo Direct Mini - Partner Showcase August 2020", "description": "A surprise Nintendo Direct Mini just dropped, revealing some upcoming titles coming soon from Nintendo partners.\n\nFeaturing Kingdom Hearts, Final Fantasy, Just Dance, and more.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lf7Y3ZHb3RI", "date_published": "2020-08-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Saving for the Next Gen Show", "description": "Gamespot and NNESAGA present: Saving for the Next Gen show!
