But ironically, the world you enriched thinks that you should be punished the most! That you should pay your \u201cfair share\u201d with their greedy \u201cprogressive\u201d tax system.\n\nNot paying taxes is a puzzle. When you operate a business that is registered in the majority of modern countries like the US, you\u2019re legally required to have your name on the business in one way or another. The key is getting your name off of the business, off of any paperwork, and to make sure that even if the US really wanted to with a warrant, they can never find out who actually owns the business. \n\nShell companies are official companies that you can open and control, but it can\u2019t be traced back to you. This way, you can open up a shell company, move your money through it, and since your name isn\u2019t attached to the shell company, tax collectors won\u2019t be able to charge you. The problem is that there is no way in hell the countries like the US would allow full-blown shell companies to be created.\n\nTax Havens are usually small countries that don\u2019t really have much going for them, so they offer an extremely enticing business environment to attract foreign businesses to work with them and collect fees. There are four main qualifiers that a country is a tax haven 1. The country has little or no taxes. 2. They have very convenient financial products and incentives 3. The financial activities of the country lack transparency And lastly, the country doesn\u2019t cooperate with other countries to give away their clients' identities. Once you have a tax haven in mind, it\u2019s time to start your shell company.\n\nYou\u2019re gonna choose a company in that tax haven that offers these financial services for sale. You can either buy a brand new shell company, or they\u2019ll have existing ones that have a history of transactions already to make it look more legitimate. Once you purchase a shell, you're gonna have to determine Who\u2019s gonna be the shareholder of the company, choose the directors and open up a bank account under your new anonymous shell company. Now it\u2019s time to put your tax haven to work.\n\nOur goal is to not pay taxes and move the money offshore into our Shell, so it can\u2019t be taxed. Then, you have to eventually get the money back home. If authorities smell any potential wrongdoing, these are the things they\u2019re gonna investigate: how you entered the offshore world, how you got your money offshore, and how you got it back to shore.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
