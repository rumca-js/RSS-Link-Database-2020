<p>With a superstar French cast including Emmanuelle Béart, this is a weirdly likable first solo directing credit for Jeanne Balibar</p><p>As an actor, Jeanne Balibar has done fine, intelligent work for decades with directors ranging from Jacques Rivette to Pedro Costa: I last saw her in Ladj Ly’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/les-miserables-review-ladj-ly-debut-feature-paris-suburb-cop-procedural">Les Mis</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/15/les-miserables-review-ladj-ly-debut-feature-paris-suburb-cop-procedural">érables</a> and this movie is set in the same Montfermeil district, partly among the high-rise blocks around which Ly sent his video-drone floating, although this film makes it looks a lot more homely. This is Balibar’s first solo directing credit (she co-directed the experimental piece For Example Electra in 2013 with Pierre Léon) and it is a genuine oddity: a four-leaf clover of a film, or maybe five leaves. You might call Wonders in the Suburbs an absurdist pastoral fantasia – suburban pastoral anyway – or maybe a Midsummer Day’s comedy.</p><p>Among the superstar French cast, Emmanuelle Béart gives a spirited, uninhibited performance as a liberal mayor elected on a radically experimental ticket: she has pledged to introduce statutory adult nap times (to counteract our frenetic money-grabbing work ethic), subsidised rooftop gardens, new language courses to promote diversity and wacky one-off events such as Kilt Days when all the men must wear kilts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/19/wonders-in-the-suburbs-review-jeanne-balibar-emmanuelle-beart">Continue reading...</a>

(Double or Nothing)</a>. Cage performed several new sound pieces at the beginning of each programme, much to the bemusement of the studio audience. He then answered questions on his specialist subject which, surprisingly, was not musical composition, but mushrooms.</p><p>Over consecutive evenings, Cage progressed to the final, answering every question correctly and doubling his prize money each time. In the final episode, with 5m lire at stake (the historical equivalent of about $8,000 or £3,000), he was asked to list the 24 names of the white-spored Agaricus as identified in GF Atkinson’s Studies of American Fungi. He named them all in alphabetical order, prompting sustained applause from the audience. “Mr Cage has proved he’s a real mushroom expert,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/13/silvio-berlusconi-bongiorno-funeral">the host</a> concluded. “He hasn’t just been an odd character performing strange music on the stage…”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/19/mushrooms-mortality-john-cage-fungi-mycology">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nigeria’s Festac festival, which cost over a billion dollars in today’s money, was an Olympic Games of pan-African culture – with Stevie Wonder the joyous headliner</p><p>Staged in Lagos, Nigeria, Festac 77 (The Second World Festival of Black and African Arts and Culture, to give it its full name) was the cultural climax of the Pan-African movement, gathering musicians, dancers, fashion designers, artists and writers representing 70 countries from Africa and the African diaspora. It was a show of worldwide black unity and self-determination, and the catalyst for Nigerian superstar Fela Kuti’s anti-government protests. It was also the platform for Stevie Wonder to consolidate his affinity with the continent.</p><p>Festac 77 was big on a more prosaic level, too. Indeed, to even call it a “festival” in the contemporary sense would be doing it a disservice – this was Olympic Games scale. Four weeks of events across 10 venues including the specially built 5,000 capacity National Theatre; 15,000 participants housed in 5,000 high-end apartments and two luxury hotels, again all built for the event; a network of highways created to avoid Lagos’s legendary traffic congestion. It was 12 years in the planning, during which time it survived a civil war, a presidential assassination and two coups (one successful, one not) and the bill came in at $400m, or $1.75bn in today’s money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/19/stevie-wonder-festac-1977-a-unifying-moment-of-transatlantic-black-pride">Continue reading...</a>

The game started its sixth season a little late thanks to Covid-19, with most of the team working from home. According to developer Respawn, one of the game’s animators had to set up a motion capture studio in his back garden. Considering the development environment, then, it’s impressive how much is packed into the latest update.</p><p>The main addition is, of course, a new legend, Rampart, a British-Indian gun store owner and entrepreneur who’s big on self-deprecating quips and regularly refers to enemies as “plonkers”. Her tactical ability is a defensive wall, which she can slam down anywhere, giving her and her teammates handy, portable cover. Shooting through its upper energy shield area amps up bullets, giving them extra damage. Meanwhile, her ultimate ability is a mini-gun emplacement which, like Bastion in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/27/overwatch-review-blizzard">Overwatch</a>, provides absolutely monstrous firepower.

But inexplicably Baruchel and his co-writer Jesse Chabot staple on a finger-waggingly pious and pointless message about violence in entertainment.</p><p>Jesse Williams stars as Toronto comic book artist Todd, who’s struggling with the final issue of his mega successful R-rated franchise Slasherman. The series is based on actual events, half a dozen grisly unsolved murders that took place along a stretch of Interstate 90 in the late 80s. To get his creative juices flowing, Todd takes a road trip along the highway, slumming it in scummy motels with his girlfriend, personal assistant and goofy business partner (nicely played by Baruchel). Todd, a left-leaning liberal who would no doubt describe himself as a feminist, is unnerved by fanboys at a comic bookstore signing. While he has intellectualised the gut-wrenchingly horrible images of tortured and disembowelled women in his comics, to the creepy guys dressed up like his protagonist in welders masks, Slasherman is a hero.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/19/random-acts-of-violence-review-jay-baruchel-jesse-williams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He composed nothing that did not involve a piano and died tragically young. Yet the Polish composer’s imagination and melodic beauty left a huge imprint on music – just ask Barry Manilow</p><p>Though he wrote no operas, oratorios or symphonies – nothing, in fact, that did not involve a piano – Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) was one of the supreme composers of the 19th century. His life – and death at the age of 39 – is almost the archetypal story of the tragic Romantic artist. His gifts as a pianist and improviser as much as his music brought him fame during his lifetime, but the beauty of his melodies has maintained his popularity ever since. Chopin has a reputation for being an exquisite miniaturist, but he was much more than that: his approach to playing and composing for the piano and his remarkable imagination for keyboard colour and texture – as well as his often startlingly original treatment of harmony and form – left their imprint on piano music well into the next century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/19/chopin-where-to-start-with-his-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Online storms over age gaps between partners have become depressingly common</p><p>In certain corners of the internet, few topics arouse as much rage as that of relationships between people of significantly different ages. It’s a cyclical controversy, which needs only the tiniest spark to reignite it.</p><p>If you’re unfamiliar with the debate, let me drag you down with me: over the past few years, a sizeable segment of the liberal-left has decided that age gaps within relationships (eg a 40-year-old going out with a 23-year-old) are inherently problematic. It’s an attitude which seems to be derived from a confluence of post-MeToo feminism and social justice politics, both of which rightly place an emphasis on caring for the vulnerable. The argument goes that age gaps reflect an imbalance of power and therefore leave young people open to coercion or abuse. The older partner is usually characterised as predatory; the younger partner as having been taken advantage of, even if they are well into their early twenties.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/19/big-age-gap-relationship-sex-consent-adults">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Students challenging the A-levels debacle have exposed the anti-democratic politics of predictive models<br /></p><p>An improbable nightmare that stalked students in the past was tearing open an envelope to find someone else’s exam results inside. On 13 August, for tens of thousands of A-level students in England, this became a reality. The predictive algorithm developed by the qualifications regulator Ofqual disregarded the hard work of many young people in a process that ascribed weight to the past performance of schools and colleges.

<p>Honey is one of the most versatile ingredients, equally useful whether you are cooking a butternut squash, preparing a barbecue marinade or making a sweet, simple ice-cream<br /></p><p>Honey comes in many forms: runny, set, wild, farmed, raw, processed. It can be filtered simply – to remove bits of wax and the odd bee leg – or more aggressively, so the end product is flawlessly clear. Monofloral types, from hives that pollinate a particular sort of plant, such as acacia, manuka and sage, can command high prices. Honeydew honey, which bees harvest not from melon flowers but from the sticky secretions of aphids, is a harder sell.</p><p>The ways in which honey can be used in the kitchen are almost as varied, but we will struggle to limit ourselves to 17.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/19/un-bee-lievable-17-ways-to-cook-with-honey-from-a-treacly-pear-tart-to-delicious-panna-cotta">Continue reading...</a>

In line with government guidelines, we closed on 18 March and furloughed our three staff members as we couldn’t receive daily attendance fees which provide our main income. Government rules state that furloughed employees cannot provide services for their employer, but what constitutes a service? The staff want to support our members by phoning/writing</strong><strong> to check they are coping, and are organising food hampers. As they only work two days a week (and we are only claiming furlough for those days), can they contact our members on the days when they would not normally be working?<br /></strong><em><strong>VR, Faringdon, Oxfordshire</strong></em></p><p>The government can reclaim any payments if furloughed staff are found to have continued working for an organisation. Julia Wilson, a partner with legal firm Baker McKenzie, reckons that any contact with your members could be in breach of the rules as the government guidance says a furloughed employee can only volunteer for another employer or organisation. Contacting members on non-working days risks being seen as an attempt to circumvent the rules. “The safest approach is not to permit these volunteer activities, although this seems very unfair,” says Wilson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/aug/19/can-our-furloughed-staff-volunteer-to-help-the-elderly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The R&amp;A, wanting to celebrate golf at Royal Troon this week, has the Duke of York as an honorary member and may fear a backlash if his status with the club were to change</p><p>This marks a big week for the R&amp;A. Its corporate wing, denied a week in the sun <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/the-open-2020-cancelled-coronavirus-pandemic-masters-us-open-uspga-golf">with a 2020 Open Championship</a>, will seek to emphasise everything that is positive about the sport – in such obscure times – as the Women’s Open rolls into Royal Troon. Yet one element of the backdrop should sit awkwardly. Prince Andrew, a past captain of the Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club, is still a part of its present. “HRH The Duke of York is an honorary member of the club,” confirmed a spokesman. “He does not currently carry out any duties on its behalf. We would not comment further on matters relating to individual members.”</p><p>When Andrew was in effect <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/20/prince-andrew-to-step-back-from-public-duties-for-foreseeable-future">suspended from royal duties by the Queen</a> in November, he admitted: “The circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family’s work and the valuable work going on in the many organisations and charities that I am proud to support.” It is curious his golf attachments – of which there are so many – remain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/19/prince-andrew-ties-awkward-questions-royal-and-ancient-womens-open">Continue reading...</a>

Don’t look away</p><p>How hot was it at the Furnace Creek visitor center at Death Valley national park on 16 August 2020? It was so hot that the huge electronic temperature display (which serves as a ubiquitous selfie backdrop) went on the fritz. Parts of the blocky digital display <a href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2020/08/17/death-valley-130-degrees-hottest-temperature-planet-since-1913/">malfunctioned</a>, resulting in numbers even higher than the actual mind-melting high on what turned out to be a landmark day.</p><p>An automated weather station at the visitor center recorded a preliminary high of 129.9F (54.4C) at 3.41pm PDT on Sunday. Even for heat-favored landscapes such as Death Valley, it is remarkable for temperatures to inch into such territory so late in the summer, when the sun is considerably lower in the sky than at the summer solstice in late June. According to weather records researcher Maximiliano Herrera, the previous global record high for August is 127.9F (53.3C), recorded in Mitribah, Kuwait, in 2011.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/19/highest-recorded-temperature-ever-death-valley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When schools in England closed in March in response to the coronavirus pandemic, it meant students could no longer take their final exams. Instead, computer modelling was used to assign grades.
