While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Frazey Ford\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/08/15/129137755/frazey-ford-tiny-desk-concert\n\nBob Boilen | August 15, 2010\nTen years ago, I heard an astonishing voice stand out in a group filled with strong singers. The voice belonged to Frazey Ford; the group was The Be Good Tanyas.\n\nThe Be Good Tanyas released three outstanding albums \u2014 Blue Horse is still a favorite of mine \u2014 and then, silence. It's been four years since we've heard Ford's lilting, laid-back sound, but now she's back with a solo record. The album, Obadiah (which also features another Be Good Tanya, Trish Klein) follows Ford's love of rhythm and blues and traditional American country music.\n\nHear An Interview\nFrazey Ford: A Soulful Return With 'Obadiah' Aug. 13, 2010\nFord came to the NPR Music offices for this Tiny Desk Concert \u2014 armed with her acoustic guitar and a cheetah jumpsuit \u2014 and lulled our office with four beautiful tunes. If you loved The Be Good Tanyas, like me, you'll be thrilled to hear her sing again. And if you've never heard Frazey Ford, you're in for a treat.\n\nSet List:\n\"Firecracker\"\n\"Lost Together\"\n\"If You Gonna Go\"\n\"The Gospel Song\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M9JPJhu3XA", "date_published": "2020-08-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
