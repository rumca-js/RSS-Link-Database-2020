Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the Heart—Is Heart Failure the Next Chapter? (JAMA, 27 July)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768915

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2763845

Increased risk for morbid and mortal complications in COVID

Pre existing cardiovascular diseases

Hypertension

Coronary artery disease

Heart failure

COVID causing heart disease

39 autopsy cases, died from COVID-19 pneumonia

Histopathologic evaluation did not meet criteria seen in acute myocarditis

Evidence of virus present in the heart in 24 of 39 patients (61.5%)

Of these 24, 16 (66.7%) patients had a high viral load

Evidence of active viral replication was also noted

Also increased activation of pro-inflammatory genes in the heart

Myocardial injury therefore possible by 2 mechanisms

In 100 recovering patients

Evaluated a mean of 71 days after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis

Detectable troponin

Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction

Ischaemia

Pericardial involvement

Cardiomyopathy and heart failure related to COVID-19 may become evident

Potential ongoing morbidity of heart failure and other chronic cardiovascular complications

England could have to consider closing pubs in order to reopen schools next month.

And so actually, closing some of the other networks, some of the other activities may well be required to enable us to open schools.

It might come down to a question of which do you trade off against each other and then that’s a matter of prioritising – do we think pubs are more important than schools?

Rise in coronavirus infections appeared to be among younger people
warned there was a danger it could “spill” over into other parts of the population.

North-west lockdowns “highly unlikely” to be the “last intervention that has to be done regionally”

‘Sadly, there are people within our community who are not taking coronavirus seriously enough. 

Since the easing of the main lockdown, a lot of people have been visiting relatives and friends and attending events in each other’s homes with very little thought of keeping themselves safe

‘We have been trying to get them to understand the message and take greater precautions but what can we do? Now, in Bradford we find ourselves in a very dangerous situation with coronavirus cases on the rise.’

Akhtar Mahmood (mosque committee)

‘One of the big problems we have had is of people going to pay their respects at the homes of 
those who have recently died. 

We lost a member of our congregation two weeks ago and there were 50 people gathered at his house to express their sympathies.’
  
A single road in Bradford registered 17 coronavirus cases within six days.
