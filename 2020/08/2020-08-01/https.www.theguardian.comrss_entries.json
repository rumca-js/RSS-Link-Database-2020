About five years ago it became clear that for many reasons the notion of us all having a voice [online] was going to take a different route than we had expected, because of brain chemistry and mob culture and what suited the profit motive... I\u2019m not in any way a technophobe: this is about the extremely alarming agenda behind [online] technologies. We\u2019re running around saying we suddenly have a voice [but] the internet infantilises you \u2013 you\u2019re automatically a teenager when you use any of these [social media] tools. They are geared that way: we\u2019re creatures who love an idea much more than a fact, and so we can ignore a whole lot of facts. As a novelist I\u2019m daunted because it\u2019s impossible... well, it was impossible to write satire 20 years ago, to be fair.<br /><br /><strong>You\u2019re finding your creative resources more stretched than when you wrote </strong><em><strong>Vernon God Little</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br />Oh yeah, for sure. I made the mistake, for about a year of writing this, of thinking, I\u2019m just gonna look five, 10 years ahead. So I invented some cool stuff; by the end of that year, all of those [made-up] technologies were old news.<br /><br /><strong>Early on in the book, the protagonist finds himself branded an abuser after he smacks his daughter.</strong><br />Lonnie was brought up in a liberal world of second chances. My life is built from second chances; I wouldn\u2019t be speaking to you but for having been forgiven and helped off the floor and back on my feet.
