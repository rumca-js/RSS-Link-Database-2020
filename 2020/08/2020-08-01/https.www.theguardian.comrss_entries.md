<p>The hellraiser turned Booker prize winner on the infantilising nature of the internet, his favourite reading choices and why second chances are so important</p><p>DBC Pierre is the author of seven books, including <em>Release the Bats</em>, a guide to writing fiction, and <em>Vernon God Little</em>, which won the Booker prize in 2003. At the ceremony, Pierre (born Peter Finlay in Australia in 1961) pledged his prize money to friends he had duped during an itinerant past life as a self-confessed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/11/books.bookerprize2003">conman</a> and addict; his initials stand for Dirty But Clean. He spoke to me from his current home in Cambridgeshire, where he wrote his latest novel, <em>Meanwhile in Dopamine City</em>, a satirical dystopia about a widowed sewage worker struggling to raise two children in an age of digital innovation run riot.<br /><br /><strong>What led you to send up big tech and the internet, or “the grid”, as it’s called </strong><strong>in the book?</strong><br />I’d love to write a book about butterflies or something, but I [got] so incensed about what’s happening. About five years ago it became clear that for many reasons the notion of us all having a voice [online] was going to take a different route than we had expected, because of brain chemistry and mob culture and what suited the profit motive... I’m not in any way a technophobe: this is about the extremely alarming agenda behind [online] technologies. We’re running around saying we suddenly have a voice [but] the internet infantilises you – you’re automatically a teenager when you use any of these [social media] tools. They are geared that way: we’re creatures who love an idea much more than a fact, and so we can ignore a whole lot of facts. As a novelist I’m daunted because it’s impossible... well, it was impossible to write satire 20 years ago, to be fair.<br /><br /><strong>You’re finding your creative resources more stretched than when you wrote </strong><em><strong>Vernon God Little</strong></em><strong>?</strong><br />Oh yeah, for sure. I made the mistake, for about a year of writing this, of thinking, I’m just gonna look five, 10 years ahead. So I invented some cool stuff; by the end of that year, all of those [made-up] technologies were old news.<br /><br /><strong>Early on in the book, the protagonist finds himself branded an abuser after he smacks his daughter.</strong><br />Lonnie was brought up in a liberal world of second chances. My life is built from second chances; I wouldn’t be speaking to you but for having been forgiven and helped off the floor and back on my feet. I believe that’s the correct way, [but] that’s being thrown out very quickly. You can be shut down from life on the basis of one mistake.<br /></p><p>My original draft actually meant to rewire your brain</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/01/dbc-pierre-you-can-be-shut-down-from-life-because-of-one-mistake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Henry Dimbleby’s national food strategy will do little for the millions who go hungry</p><p>The headlines were compelling. The Covid-19 crisis would lead to a dramatic increase in poverty and hunger; free school meals should be extended to a further 1.6 million children; another 1.1 million children in England should become eligible for holiday food programmes. The <a href="https://www.nationalfoodstrategy.org/partone/">National Food Strategy document</a> released last Wednesday was, on the face of it, an impressive opening shot from the team led by businessman Henry Dimbleby.</p><p>But for all the laudable anger over hunger contained in this first report from the National Food Strategy, it was received across the world of food production and policy with at best eye-rolling and at worst exasperation. It is the product of grubby politics, includes worrying proposals on post-Brexit trade policy, muddled thinking on the causes of poverty and risks wasting a golden opportunity to answer one of the most important challenges of the 21st century: how we feed ourselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/01/this-isnt-a-tough-new-food-policy-for-post-brexit-uk-its-thin-gruel-and-easy-to-set-to-one-side">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If this was one of the sterner tests Rangers will face in a season where the making of history is on the agenda, perhaps a title race as worthy of the name will develop after all. The scoreline from the Premiership opener in Aberdeen shows the most narrow of victories. In reality it was a different story: Steven Gerrard’s team were vastly superior to an opposition who only showed menace in a form worthy of disciplinary action. Andrew Considine was duly handed a red card for his late, wild lunge on Scott Arfield.</p><p>Much earlier, Ryan Kent endorsed Rangers’ early dominance with a calm finish. On repeat viewing, the goal was more impressive than had initially appeared.

He is the co-author with his colleague Jevin D West of a new book, <em>Calling Bullshit: The Art of S</em><em>cepticism in a Data-Driven World</em><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Your book is very timely in that it suggests the exponential spread of bullshit would eventually crash against fact in spectacular fashion.

<p>Thomas Heatherwick has risen to an important challenge, bringing to Leeds’s university hospital this latest in a series of bespoke, calming environments for people with cancer<br /></p><p>Maggie’s Centres are based on some beautiful ideas. They offer to people hit by cancer – to families and carers as well as patients – emotional, social and practical support that complements their medical treatment. They do so in spaces that are in some way comforting and inspiring, the opposite of the generic medicalised environments, all air-conditioned and fluorescent-lit and plastic-surfaced, of modern hospitals. They offer, in an institutional and standardised wilderness, oases of the bespoke and personal.</p><p>This concept presents a special challenge to architects. It exposes which of their devices really do help people to feel better, and which are stunts and twirls to promote their brand and impress their peers. A well-placed window, a calming material, the fall of light, a soothing acoustic are all more important to the aims of Maggie’s than the signature moves of a famous designer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/01/maggies-centre-st-jamess-hospital-leeds-review-a-safe-place-for-flamboyance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Russell Crowe’s car chase thriller is an entertaining send-up of emasculated men</p><p>Stuck in standstill traffic, single mum Rachel (the sparky Caren Pistorius) is late dropping her son, Kyle (Gabriel Bateman), at school and on the verge of being fired from an already precarious freelance hairdressing gig. Her ex-husband is being difficult and her ailing mother has recently been relocated to a care home. When she honks her horn and impatiently overtakes a grey pick-up truck, it’s understandable. Unfortunately, its driver is also feeling fragile. Unnamed in the film but listed in its credits as “The Man”, a hulking, sweating, highly medicated Russell Crowe demands an apology. “I need you to learn what a bad day is and I need you to learn how to say sorry,” he seethes, attempting to run her over for the remainder of the film.</p><p>This zippy car chase thriller shares some DNA with Joel Schumacher’s 1993 black comedy <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/03/falling-down-jamon-jamon-review-1993-archive">Falling Down</a></em>, which saw Michael Douglas’s white collar divorcee clashing with Los Angeles’s multicultural residents after abandoning his car and making his way across the city on foot. Both are darkly funny studies and send-ups of emasculated men, with Crowe’s character claiming to have been “dismissed as the unworthiest fuck to ever walk the planet”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/01/unhinged-review-darkly-funny-tale-of-road-rage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ahead of a new Barbican show, the visual artist discusses being a ‘weird, creative type’ and why moving to Alabama made her question everything</p><p>Toyin Ojih Odutola was born in Ife, Nigeria, in 1985. She moved to the US aged five, first to Berkeley, California, then to Huntsville, Alabama, where her father worked as a professor and her mother as a nurse. Odutola is renowned for her intricate portraits drawn with ink, pastel and charcoal. Zadie Smith called her “one of the most exciting young artists working today”, and has written an introduction to Odutola’s new Barbican show, <em>A Countervailing Theory</em><em>.</em></p><p><strong>Your new show imagines an ancient civilisation in central Nigeria where women rule over an underclass of black male humanoids. How did this idea come to you?<br /></strong>It came from two separate incidents: one was reading an article about rock formations in central Nigeria, which indicated that some ancient civilisation had arranged them in such a way; the second was from an episode of the BBC podcast <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00st9zb">A History of the World in 100 Objects</a></em> on the Ife head. A German archaeologist discovered the [centuries-old brass statue] in 1910 and couldn’t conceive of Nigerians having the mental aptitude to create such anatomically correct and beautiful objects, so he decided that Greeks from Atlantis had made it. I started asking, who has a right to create their own stories? I wanted to create a work of art that, visually, stood apart from occidental picture-making, that felt very “other”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/01/artist-toyin-ojih-odutola-through-drawing-i-can-cope-with-racism-sexism-cultural-friction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Republic)<br /></p><p>Swift’s lyrical power just about survives the greige indie atmospherics supplied by the National’s Aaron Dessner</p><p>Taylor Swift’s surprise eighth album, <em>Folklore</em>, takes 16 complex and intriguing tunes by pop’s reigning colossus and gussies them up in atmospherics acceptable to the mature indie rock listener. Gone are the brash production values, the musical pugilism that codes Swift as “pop”. Gone are the trademark valedictory shouts at the end of her songs. In their place are tunes that exhibit a desire to be taken seriously by a different demographic, one whose delicate sensibilities are more responsive to ruminative thrums and just-so orchestrations.</p><p>Take Epiphany, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUnDkI7l9LQ">war-themed song</a> Swift has said was inspired by her grandfather Dean landing on the beaches of Guadalcanal in 1942. The song is sombre, its medical subplot chiming gently with the suffering being wreaked by coronavirus (“Hold your hand through plastic now/ Doc I think she’s crashing out”).

## The Housing Lark: Sam Selvon's strikingly relevant, lesser-known classic

<p>Greenhorns, hustlers and dope dealers banter and bicker in this 1960s novel following migrants in London as they navigate racist landlords and English snootiness</p><p><em>The Lonely Londoners</em>, Sam Selvon’s classic 1956 novel about West Indian migrants making their way in the old metropolis, ended on a blue note. Its chief character Moses found himself at the banks of the Thames brooding about things. Chasing skirt, having laughs, rum and revelry to fight off the frigid winters: was this living? It certainly wasn’t enough. He fears “a forlorn shadow of doom fall on all the spades in the country”, and that he and his friends are just “spades jostling in the crowd, bewildered, hopeless”. Perhaps, he wonders, his friends’ joie de vivre has been a lie. “As if the boys laughing, but they only laughing because they fraid to cry.”</p><p>By the start of <em>The Housing Lark</em>, published nine years later, life hasn’t changed much. Battersby (aka Bat) lies in a damp Brixton basement thinking about the good life and how far out of reach it appears. He’d like the warmth of a nice woman. Unlimited dumplings and pigtail soup. Most of all, he’d like not to have to worry about rent. His friend Gallows believes that “if a man have a home he establish his right to live”. Bat wants to feel less temporary, to be elevated to at least street-level citizenship. He and his pals cook up a scheme to pool their money and save up for a place, even if it’s in Croydon, they can call their own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/01/the-housing-lark-sam-selvons-strikingly-relevant-lesser-known-classic">Continue reading...</a>

## Removing monuments is the easy part. We must make America a real democracy | Rev William Barber and Bernice King

<p>Flags and statues may fall, but the real struggle is for genuine voting rights, equal healthcare and truly integrated schools<br /></p><p>One hundred and fifty-five years after Confederate troops surrendered at Appomattox and Bennett Place, their battle flag has finally come down in Mississippi and their statues are retreating from courthouse squares and university quads. As the children of generations of Black southerners who fought against the lies of the Lost Cause, we celebrate this most recent surrender and look forward to walking down streets that are not shadowed by monuments to men who claimed to own our ancestors. But we cannot understand why these monuments lasted so long without challenging the inequities they were erected to justify. In fact, many who support flags and statues coming down today also advocate voter suppression, attack healthcare and re-segregate our schools. We must attend to both the systems of injustice and the monuments that have justified them if we are to realize “liberty and justice for all”.</p><p>If you examine the bases of statues that are being hauled away, most bear a date between the 1890s and 1920s. These monuments did not rise in defiance of the federal troops who were sent by Congress and Ulysses S Grant to enforce Reconstruction and guarantee political power to the new Black citizens of the south in the 1860s and 1870s. If a statue of Robert E Lee or Jefferson Davis had been proposed during Reconstruction, the very suggestion would have sparked a riot. But after the compromise of 1876, when Rutherford B Hayes agreed to remove federal troops from the south, newly established Black and white political alliances were subjected to the violence of white terrorist organizations and the propaganda of white supremacy campaigns.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/01/us-real-democracy-voting-rights-healthcare-schools">Continue reading...</a>

The protein-rich seeds of beans, peas and lentils are nutritious, easy to grow and leave the world in better shape, thanks to their relationship with soil bacteria.</p><p>These bacteria are known as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/sep/12/gardens" title="">rhizobia</a>. They take atmospheric nitrogen, which is useless to plants, and turn it into forms the plant can use, such as ammonia. They also make the phosphate in the soil, which is essential for plant vigour, soluble, and produce hormones that help the plant develop and fine-tune its pest defences. In return, the plant houses the bacteria and ensures there is a good supply of oxygen and plenty of raw ingredients such as carbon and nutrients.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/01/save-the-world-grow-beans-and-peas">Continue reading...</a>

As the final book is published, she reflects on an epic undertaking</p><p>Long long ago. In the days before the words “Brexit” and “Covid-19” existed. Back when “unprecedented<em>”</em> wasn’t yet an everyday kind of word. I’m talking back, before the words “Windrush” and “Grenfell” took on terrible new meaning, before an MP was murdered outside the library of her constituency by a man shouting the words Britain and First, back when the word “humbug”, traditionally a sign of its speaker’s Scrooge-like spirit, hadn’t yet been used in parliament to handbag female MPs pleading with a British prime minister to be less aggressive given the real threat they faced (and face) every day. Back then, on a quiet winter dark afternoon in December 2015, I met my publisher, Simon Prosser, outside the British Library in London.</p><p>We were on our way to see some of Keats’s handwriting. I’d had an idea for a series of books; the first one, which I was about to start, was going to be called <em>Autumn</em>, and we thought we’d visit Keats’s poem about autumn in the original as a sort of talisman.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/01/before-brexit-grenfell-covid-19-ali-smith-on-writing-four-novels-in-four-years">Continue reading...</a>

This wasn’t Apple. This wasn’t Uber. Guests on their way to Zoomtopia would have to explain to cab drivers and hotel concierges what Zoom was.

<p>UN representative has two months to secure ceasefire but warns that risks are rising </p><p>The Libyan people are increasingly scared that their future is being taken out of their hands by external actors, and that the risk of a regional war is rising, Stephanie Williams, the acting UN special envoy for Libya, said on Saturday.</p><p>Williams said on a visit to London: “The Libyan people are exhausted and scared in equal measure. They are tired of war, and want peace, but they fear this is not in their hands now. They want a solution and a ceasefire.
