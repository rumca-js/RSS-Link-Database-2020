In this time, fan-favorite maps have been re-used and remastered into other games and game modes. Developer Infinity Ward has done a great job of re-purposing these maps from their award-winning single player missions over the years. Not all of them are obvious, and take some digging and boundary-breaking to find. Let\u2019s take a look back at some of these memorable maps and their history in the Modern Warfare series.\n\nFirst up is Crash from Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. This map has not only been used across multiple Modern Warfare titles, it\u2019s also had 24/7 playlists and a special winter time version called \u201cWinter Crash\u201d. This version replaces character deaths with boxes of presents and even has a Santa Claus Easter egg. Next is the \u201cInvasion\u201d map, which debuted in 2009\u2019s Modern Warfare 2. This one is a little tricky to find as it\u2019s hidden within the Euphrates Bridge map from 2019\u2019s Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare. While it\u2019s more of an unfinished outline, the memories from MW2\u2019s multiplayer still come rolling in.\n\nThe iconic map \u201cRust\u201d from Modern Warfare 2 has made its way into four of Infinity Ward\u2019s titles. Sadly, one of them is an unplayable Easter egg within Advanced Warfare\u2019s map \u201cCargo\u201d. Also from Modern Warfare 2 is \u201cScrapyard\u201d. This small airplane graveyard map has been reused across nearly every game mode within 2019\u2019s Modern Warfare. Next up is \u201cVacant\u201d from Call Of Duty 4. This fan-favorite map stems from the iconic \u201cAll Ghillied Up\u201d mission and has been reused and remastered in nearly every Modern Warfare title. \u201cBroadcast\u201d from Call of Duty 4 was a DLC map that made a surprising comeback into 2019\u2019s Modern Warfare and even Warzone. Last but certainly not least is the Gulag. Despite its popularity and infamy in Warzone, this small map got its start in Modern Warfare 2 in the mission \u201cThe Gulag\u201d. The memorable mission called for players to rescue prisoner 627 aka Captain Price himself.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWz1fjs08hE", "date_published": "2020-08-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Lore | The Bloody Origins of Night City, The Worst Place To Live In America", "description": "Select images courtesy of R.

In preparation for the release of CD Projekt Red's upcoming first-person RPG, we're going to look back at the events and characters that shaped Night City so you'll be well informed on the world of Cyberpunk when the game releases this November.\n\nThere's no better place to begin than the very beginning. In the video above, Jean-Luc Seipke details the origin of Night City, starting with the conception of the corporate-run city by construction company head Richard Night. As you can probably surmise, Night City has a rather bloody history that was defined by corporate deals, assassinations, mob violence, and societal strife. \n\nBy the year 2077, Night City had been built upon the foundation of four distinct visual styles, each of which details the different ages of cultural and social-economic growth that occurred in the Cyberpunk universe since 2020. CD Projekt Red is hoping this design creates a \"unique take\" for the franchise.\n\n\"There are layers to the design of Night City and all its inhabitants, so when you drive around and you see a building that's sort of pink with these soft edges, and the windows are sort of soft shaped, you know that this is kitsch style, and you know that was built in that period of time where people had more money back then,\" Cyberpunk 2077 concept art coordinator Marthe Jonkers said, according to GamesIndustry.Biz. \"It's telling you a story about the background of the city, and gives an extra layer of believability.\"\n\nImages used in this video are sourced from the Cyberpunk Red Jumpstart Kit and Cyberpunk 2020 Night City Soucebook.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxexheSCcN4", "date_published": "2020-08-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
