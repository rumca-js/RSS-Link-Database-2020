But for her, staying home from work until the coronavirus pandemic passes is not an option.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\n\nThrough her job as a broccoli picker in California\u2019s Salinas Valley, an area that supplies much of the country\u2019s leafy greens, Hernandez provides for a household that includes her mother, her children and her two siblings \u2014 one of whom is blind and deaf, and another who is quadriplegic.\n\n\u201cIn these times,\u201d Hernandez says, \u201cit\u2019s necessity that makes us work despite the fear we have.\u201d\n\nWhile millions of people in America have been sheltering in place, Hernandez is one of many members of the country\u2019s largely immigrant agricultural workforce who have been maintaining the country\u2019s food supply throughout the pandemic \u2014 and who speak out in a new FRONTLINE investigation about their experiences of having to choose between their health and their jobs.\n\n\u201cThey are not giving us the essentials to protect ourselves,\u201d Hernandez says in the above excerpt from the FRONTLINE documentary \"COVID\u2019s Hidden Toll.\" \n\nWatch \"COVID's Hidden Toll\" starting July 21: https://to.pbs.org/39dJ0PX\n\nFrom journalists Daffodil Altan and Andr\u00e9s Cediel, \"COVID\u2019s Hidden Toll\" is the latest installment in FRONTLINE\u2019s award-winning body of work exposing the hidden realities facing low-wage immigrant workers in the U.S., many of whom are undocumented (Rape in the Fields, Rape on the Night Shift, Trafficked in America).\n\nThrough the stories of people including Hernandez, the investigation examines how so far, there are no national mandatory COVID protections specifically for agriculture workers \u2013 only voluntary guidelines; how companies don\u2019t have to tell employees about outbreaks at their worksites; and the efforts to put in place more aggressive measures in California, where many of America\u2019s fruits and vegetables are grown.\n\nThe film is supported by Chasing the Dream, a public media initiative from WNET in New York that examines poverty, justice and economic opportunity in America.\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
