Long term immunity

It would be good if,

Antibodies provide “real-world” protection

Cellular immunity is long-lasting

Memory B and T lymphocytes

T helpers, suppressors, killers (cytotoxic)

Even in mild cases.

Marion Pepper, immunologist, University of Washington

This is exactly what you would hope for

All the pieces are there to have a totally protective immune response

Smita Iyer, immunologist, University of California, Davis

This is very promising

This calls for some optimism about herd immunity, and potentially a vaccine 

Professor Danny Altmann, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College

While this is a small study, it offers a remarkable, real-life, human experiment at a time when we've been short of hard-line, formal, proof that neutralising antibodies genuinely offer protection from re-infection

In short, it’s good news

Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with high attack rate

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.13.20173161v1

University of Washington IRB

Identification of immunological correlates would help research

Only animal models to date

Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing boat

Attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals)

Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing

Repeat testing after return to shore

Full data on 120 of the 122 crew (9 women)

18 day trip, crew member required hospitalization

Median follow-up of 32.5 days

104 individuals had a positive antigen test or seroconverted during the follow-up period

101 developed IgG antibodies within 50 days

Also

Three crew members seropositive prior to the boat's departure

None of these crew members with antibodies developed symptoms or tested antigen positive

Lab studies also showed their antibodies had neutralising activity

Presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against re-infection (p=0.002).

Robust T cell immunity in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19

Center for Infectious Medicine, Stockholm

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888v1

Virus-specific memory T cells have been shown to persist for many years after infection with SARS-CoV-1 

Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells display high cytotoxic activity

Correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members

and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19

Collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses

akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines

natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.

SARS-CoV-2 induces robust memory T cell responses in antibody-seronegative and antibody-seropositive individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.



Functional SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory persists after mild COVID-19

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20171843v2

Study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board

The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases continue to rise. 

The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic disease

but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity

Longitudinal assessment

Individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19

To determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory

Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody

As well as virus-specific memory B and T cells

In some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset

Memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity

Memory T cells secreted IFN-γ (interferon Gama) and expanded upon antigen re-encounter

Memory B cells expressed specific antibodies

CDC, COVID-19 Infections in children

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html

Number and rate of cases, steadily increasing from March to July 2020

True incidence not known

As of 3rd August

0 – 17 years

22% of the US population

7.3% of all cases 

Hospitalization rates in children, significantly lower

It is unclear

If children are as susceptible to infection compared with adults

If they can transmit the virus as effectively as adults

Children likely have the same or higher viral loads

Children can spread the virus effectively in households and camp settings

Community mitigation measures and school closures, therefore low transmission so far

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html

Clinical Presentation

Incubation period, about the same as adults, at 2-14 days with an average of 6 days

Signs or symptoms of COVID-19 in children include:

Cough

Fever

Fatigue

Headache

Myalgia

Nasal congestion or rhinorrhea

New loss of taste or smell

Sore throat

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Abdominal pain

Diarrhea

Nausea or vomiting

Poor appetite or poor feeding

May have many of these non-specific symptoms

May only have a few (such as only upper respiratory symptoms or only gastrointestinal symptoms)

May be asymptomatic 

16%

45%

Differential diagnosis

Influenza

Streptococcal pharyngitis

Allergic rhinitis

Lack of specificity of signs or symptoms, significant proportion of asymptomatic infections, symptom-based screening challenging

Severity of Illness in Children

Less likely to develop severe illness compared with adults

Still at risk of developing severe illness and complications

Rate of hospitalization,  8.0 per 100,000 population

(Adults 164.5 per 100,000 population)

hospitalization rates in children are increasing

1 in 3 children hospitalized were admitted to the intensive care unit, (same as hospitilized adults)

Increases risk

Certain underlying medical conditions

Infants (age under 1 year) 

Comorbidities

Medical complexity

Genetic

Neurologic

Metabolic

Obesity

Diabetes

Asthma

Chronic lung disease

Sickle cell disease

Immunosuppression

Hospitalization rates

Higher among Hispanic/Latino

Black

Complications

Respiratory failure

Myocarditis

Shock

Acute renal failure

Coagulopathy,

Multi-organ system failure

Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C)
