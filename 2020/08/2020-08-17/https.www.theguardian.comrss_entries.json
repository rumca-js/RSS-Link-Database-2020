I also suspected a soft spot, which I hoped would go away in the fridge drawer. Strangely, it did not go away, and the next day I picked up the pepper and put my thumb through its side. <br /><br />Fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, dry: the five stages of decomposition, one of the few things I remember from biology lessons at school. They are the stages of vertebrate animal decomposition, I know (I feel them all), but surely they can be applied to fruit and vegetables, too? As hard as I try to be vigilant, I usually have something at all five stages of decomposition in my kitchen, especially at this time of year, when the window between firm and ripe with a halo of fruit flies is not a big one. Tomatoes, apricots and peaches are the trickiest: the kitchen counter in August is a sort of incubator, but the fridge numbs out flavour, and in the case of tomatoes alters their flesh so you get that soft, mealy texture when they\u2019re brought back to room temperature. Again, I feel this. I also know the red pepper should never have been in the fruit bowl; it was careless, and now here I am with my thumb inside a soft, gaping hole.</p><p>Active decay requires action. \u201cIt won\u2019t hurt you, Just wash or scrape it off, cut it off or out.\u201d I\u2019m glad to have learned these lessons young from every woman in my family, and to have had them fortified by Vincenzo, who is his grandmother\u2019s grandson and even more ruthless than me \u2013 only not as careless. Cutting off the rotten bit felt like amends for my carelessness. As did slicing what was left and cooking it slowly in olive oil with sliced red onion and, after a while, endive, then treating it all to a handful of pine nuts, currants, sugar and vinegar for what turned out to be a Sicilian-tasting sweet-and sour-mixture to have with potatoes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/17/rachel-roddy-recipe-peppers-and-potatoes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/17/rachel-roddy-recipe-peppers-and-potatoes", "date_published": "2020-08-17 10:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Poem of the week: Akwaba by Kwame Dawes", "description": "<p>A father welcomes his wailing newborn child to the world and as her time begins he vows his love for ever<br /></p><p><strong>Akwaba<br /></strong><em>For Sena</em></p><p>i<br />Brown snow lines the roadways.<br />The still, grey city whispers</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/17/poem-of-the-week-akwaba-by-kwame-dawes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/17/poem-of-the-week-akwaba-by-kwame-dawes", "date_published": "2020-08-17 10:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "PwC and Schroders will allow staff to work from home after Covid crisis", "description": "<p>Accountancy firm and the fund manager will \u2018rethink the rulebook on flexibility\u2019</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/aug/17/coronavirus-live-news-new-zealand-postpones-election-italy-closes-nightclubs\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>PricewaterhouseCoopers and Schroders are to allow the majority of staff to continue to work from home after the Covid-19 pandemic as the health emergency prompts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/18/from-boardroom-to-spare-room-the-working-from-home-revolution-coronavirus\">a major shift in the office-based culture</a> that has been a hallmark of City firms for generations.</p><p>The accounting company PwC, which employs 22,000 staff in the UK, is predicting that the majority of employees will move to a more even split of home and office working on a permanent basis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/17/pwc-and-schroders-staff-can-still-work-from-home-after-covid-crisis\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/17/pwc-and-schroders-staff-can-still-work-from-home-after-covid-crisis", "date_published": "2020-08-17 09:39:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "No standing still: the best of lockdown dance", "description": "<p>From an elegant ode to San Francisco to Japanese hip-hop in a park, here\u2019s how dancers are tackling our new normal</p><p>This is the good stuff when it comes to lockdown dance.
