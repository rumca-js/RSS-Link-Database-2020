Special warnings for multigenerational households

Assume you are positive if there is an outbreak in your area

Urging states with high numbers to virtual school

These need to stop

Liverpool

Local plan much more likely to succeed than nationally imposed measures

Matt Ashton, director of public health for Liverpool,

Multi-generational transmission

Enhanced outbreak control action plan

Princes Park

Community volunteers are going door to door

Raise awareness of testing availability and to promote key public health messages

Pop-up walk-in test centre is also available.

Suspension of gatherings and events in the area

Continued closure of community buildings

Shielding continued

Prevent more draconian lockdown

I think trust is a massive issue here. I just don’t think we have trust in the national system for people to tell us what we need to do. 

Therefore we are much more likely to have success if we lead this locally, if we use our community champions and leaders, our faith leaders and our volunteers, and use people who actually understand the area, live and work in the area and get the message across that way.

Response from the community to the new measures has been “phenomenal”

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the Heart—Is Heart Failure the Next Chapter? (JAMA, 27 July)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2768915

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2763845

Increased risk for morbid and mortal complications in COVID

Pre existing cardiovascular diseases

Hypertension

Coronary artery disease

Heart failure

COVID causing heart disease

39 autopsy cases, died from COVID-19 pneumonia

Histopathologic evaluation did not meet criteria seen in acute myocarditis

Evidence of virus present in the heart in 24 of 39 patients (61.5%)

Of these 24, 16 (66.7%) patients had a high viral load

Evidence of active viral replication was also noted

Also increased activation of pro-inflammatory genes in the heart

Myocardial injury therefore possible by 2 mechanisms

In 100 recovering patients

Evaluated a mean of 71 days after confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis

Detectable troponin

Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction

Ischaemia

Pericardial involvement

Cardiomyopathy and heart failure related to COVID-19 may become evident

Potential ongoing morbidity of heart failure and other chronic cardiovascular complications
