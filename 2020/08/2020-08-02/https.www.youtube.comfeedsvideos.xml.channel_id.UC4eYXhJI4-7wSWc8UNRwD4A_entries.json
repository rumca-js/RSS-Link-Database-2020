Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAugust 3, 2020 | Bob Boilen - John Legend fully embraced the spirit of the Tiny Desk for his quarantine concert. He filmed this four-song performance in an office, in this case the Los Angeles office of his management company Friends At Work. He endearingly refers to his piano as his \"tiny desk.\" He flew his seven-piece band out from Philadelphia to fill that office with utter joy.\n\nThey kick off the set with \"Ooh Laa,\" a song John calls \"doo-wop meets trap\" it's also the lead-off track to his summer album, Bigger Love. In fact, all of the songs filmed on this day are from Bigger Love, including \"Conversations in the Dark,\" which John says is \"a good song for babies to dance to \u2014 you might want to get married to it, too, if you're so inclined.\" Meanwhile, behind the band on a big screen reads, \"Speak the truth, even if your voice shakes.\"\n\nWhile introducing his final song, \"Bigger Love,\"he tells us that \"I wrote all the songs before the pandemic, before we saw folks marching in the streets, mourning (the) life of George Floyd, expressing their outrage. But some of these songs feel even more appropriate now, feel like we need them more now then we did even when I wrote them. This song 'Bigger Love' is about the power of love to get us through tough times, the idea that when you have love, it makes you more resilient, it makes you more hopeful And we all need a little dance break, too, right?\" So enjoy and turn it up.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFxQbPYe_ZA", "date_published": "2020-08-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Frazey Ford: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert From The Archives", "description": "We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Frazey Ford\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/08/15/129137755/frazey-ford-tiny-desk-concert\n\nBob Boilen | August 15, 2010\nTen years ago, I heard an astonishing voice stand out in a group filled with strong singers. The voice belonged to Frazey Ford; the group was The Be Good Tanyas.\n\nThe Be Good Tanyas released three outstanding albums \u2014 Blue Horse is still a favorite of mine \u2014 and then, silence. It's been four years since we've heard Ford's lilting, laid-back sound, but now she's back with a solo record. The album, Obadiah (which also features another Be Good Tanya, Trish Klein) follows Ford's love of rhythm and blues and traditional American country music.\n\nHear An Interview\nFrazey Ford: A Soulful Return With 'Obadiah' Aug. 13, 2010\nFord came to the NPR Music offices for this Tiny Desk Concert \u2014 armed with her acoustic guitar and a cheetah jumpsuit \u2014 and lulled our office with four beautiful tunes. If you loved The Be Good Tanyas, like me, you'll be thrilled to hear her sing again. And if you've never heard Frazey Ford, you're in for a treat.\n\nSet List:\n\"Firecracker\"\n\"Lost Together\"\n\"If You Gonna Go\"\n\"The Gospel Song\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M9JPJhu3XA", "date_published": "2020-08-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
