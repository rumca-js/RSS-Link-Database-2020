But, unlike football or Eurovision, this is not a league table you want to head.</p><p>The ONS analysis completely ignores the statistics on coronavirus deaths that we hear about all the time, and instead simply counts the total number of deaths from whatever cause.

<p>The government has had a jolting reminder that the coronavirus crisis can’t be simply wished away<br /></p><p>A few weeks ago, a group of civil servants at the Cabinet Office were tasked with what you might consider an impossible mission. The officials were told to find a way of re-opening nightclubs in a coronavirus-safe way. A bright group, they reported back with some ideas, but each collided with the fundamental problem at the heart of this exercise. The socially distanced nightclub is a contradiction in terms. Nightclubs, by their very nature, are all about social intimacy.</p><p>I relate this story to illustrate just how very desperate the government has been to release Britain from every aspect of lockdown and return us to something that resembles the pre-coronavirus world as closely as possible. They dreamed of returning to that prelapsarian age in which you could eat out with your family, go drinking with your mates, commute to work, celebrate a religious festival or jet off to a holiday somewhere reliably sunny without having to worry about catching or spreading a deadly disease. While never quite saying it explicitly, their ambition has essentially been to get everything open again. This has been driven by a Treasury so frantic to get the economy on its feet that it is offering taxpayer-funded bribes to get people back into eateries over August. This has combined with a Downing Street desirous to create the impression that the crisis is subsiding, not least in the hope that this would blunt memories of the many blunders it committed in the opening phases of the epidemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/02/why-boris-johnson-is-suddenly-spooked-by-the-spectre-of-a-second-spike">Continue reading...</a>

Who could resist?</p><p>Friday was one of those mornings when, from the pier – with the new morning’s golden sand stretching away in both directions and the first arrivals bashing in the poles of wind breaks – you could see Skegness as 30-year-old Billy Butlin must have seen it when he took the train to the sleepy Victorian resort in 1927.

The government can exhort us to “get out and spend” as much as it likes, but so far, we don’t seem terribly keen.

But in deepest lockdown, our local high street felt only marginally stranger than it normally does: half the “units” (in estate-agent speak) were already empty, plate glass reflecting plate glass, an untended alarm echoing off the window of a defunct River Island. The Saturday circuit on my local high street that was the high point of my teenage week is a roll call of the fallen: Miss Selfridge, Accessorize, Dotty P and Woolies are all gone: only Body Shop survives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/02/emma-beddington-fantasy-retail-therapy-these-are-the-shops-that-i-really-miss">Continue reading...</a>

## Riding the giant: big-wave surfing in Nazaré

<p>A small fishing hamlet in Portugal has become a magnet for the world’s most fearless big-wave surfers. Tim Lewis reveals how Nazaré became the ocean’s Everest</p><p>Everyone you meet in Nazaré tells you the waves here are different: heavier, more powerful, less predictable, somehow menacing. So, on my last afternoon in the Portuguese town in February, I went out on the back of a jet ski piloted by Andrew Cotton, a big-wave surfer from Devon, to see for myself. Cotton is easygoing, with cropped, gold-tipped hair and pale eyes, but he turns serious as we leave the harbour. He explains that jet skis are set up differently in Nazaré: the kill switch, which cuts the engine if the rider is thrown off, is not attached to the driver’s wrist as usual because… I miss the exact reason as Cotton guns the engine and sea spray covers us and I’m distracted, wondering if they really had to call it a “kill” switch. I’m already freaked out enough that I’ve promised to check in with my family as soon as I’m back on dry land.</p><p>Nazaré, specifically Praia do Norte or North Beach, is home to the biggest surfable waves on the planet. Ten years ago, it was unknown even in big-wave circles, but that changed when Garrett McNamara, a 52-year-old Hawaiian who is one of the pioneers of the sport, was given a tip-off by local bodyboarders. He came to Portugal for the first time in 2010; the following year, he rode a monstrous wave measured at 23.77m (78ft) and entered the Guinness World Records. In 2017, also in Nazaré, Brazilian Rodrigo Koxa nudged up the mark to 24.38m (80ft). If one day someone conquers a 100ft wave – a holy grail of surfing – almost certainly it will take place in Nazaré.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/02/nazare-in-portugal-is-the-home-to-the-worlds-biggest-waves-and-bravest-surfers">Continue reading...</a>

## Summerland review – wartime wonderment with Gemma Arterton

<p>The British actor excels as a crotchety loner who takes in a child evacuee in Jessica Swale’s uplifting debut feature</p><p>What a lovely, hopeful and rather magical movie this is. The feature debut from writer/director Jessica Swale, whose impressive theatre CV includes the Olivier award-winner <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/12/nell-gwynn-review-gemma-arterton-apollo-london">Nell Gwynn</a></em>, <em>Summerland </em>provides just the tonic we need in times of turmoil. A tale of love lost and found, told with wit and charm, it maintains an impressive balance between the sly and the sentimental, gently subverting mainstream formulae as it slips back and forth in time, alternating between the realist and the romantic.</p><p>We open in coastal Kent, 1975, with Penelope Wilton’s crotchety Alice rudely shooing children from the door of her cottage (“You know how you can help the aged? You can bugger off!”) so she can return to her typewriter. From here, we spiral back to the 40s, where the younger Alice (Gemma Arterton) taps away on the same keyboard. A recluse who investigates and debunks myths and folklore, searching for the facts behind the fiction, Alice is viewed with suspicion. The village children think she’s a witch or a spy; even the adults seem a bit scared of her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/02/summerland-review-wartime-wonderment-with-gemma-arterton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rather than admit to its own failings during the Covid-19 outbreak, the government is vilifying those least able to defend themselves<br /></p><p>The role of government, the US political scientist <a href="https://wagner.nyu.edu/community/faculty/lawrence-m-mead">Lawrence Mead</a> wrote in his 1986 book <em>Beyond Entitlement</em>, is to “persuade [people] to blame themselves”. Mead is the godfather of workfare (schemes that make welfare benefits conditional on the claimant working) and a key proponent of the “culture of poverty” thesis – the belief that the poor have only themselves to blame for their poverty.</p><p>“Persuading people to blame themselves” could also be a good description of the government’s strategy through the coronavirus crisis. A key theme of the pandemic has been the recognition of its unequal impact; that the poor, the old and ethnic minorities are all disproportionately affected. Yet throughout, ministers have sought to distance themselves from the consequences of their policies – the failure to introduce a proper system of test and trace, the abandonment of care homes, the inadequate stocks of PPE – and striven to blame the behaviour of individuals, especially the poor and the working class.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/02/illness-obesity-racism-who-gets-blamed-for-our-crises-the-poor-of-course">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beijing has lost its patience with the former colony.

It ended with the sacking of a tenured professor, <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/29/asia/hong-kong-security-law-election-intl-hnk/index.html">the arrests of four students for social media posts</a>, the electoral <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/29/hong-kong-student-activists-arrested-under-new-security-law">disqualification of </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/29/hong-kong-student-activists-arrested-under-new-security-law">12 pro-democracy politicians</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/concern-as-hong-kong-postpones-elections-for-one-year-citing-covid-19">delay of legislative elections for a year </a>and the issuance of arrest warrants for pro-democracy activists overseas under the new legislation.</p><p>In normal times, each of these acts would spark outrage and protests, but this onslaught has been too fast and too overwhelming to fully report, let alone counter, especially during a pandemic when gatherings of more than two people have been banned. Put simply, within a single month, Beijing has dismantled a partially free society and is trying to use its new law to enforce global censorship on speech regarding Hong Kong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/02/books-pulled-from-library-shelves-songs-bannedits-the-new-normal-in-hong-kong">Continue reading...</a>

And indeed, to a large extent, it was. One saw it, for example, in the aggressiveness of the questioning by the Democrats.

<p>Boris Johnson’s government has been serving up some confusing messages about diet, but there is a solution…</p><p>When the documentary <em>Super Size Me</em> came out, I was asked by a somewhat sadistic editor – following the idea of the film – to eat nothing but the greasiest junk food for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a week and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2004/jul/11/foodanddrink.shopping">write about the experience</a>.</p><p>At the time, I was no stranger to the occasional cheeseburger. As that week went on, though, the prospect of the next meal became more and more unhappy. By the seventh day, ragged on salt and sugar, there was a nasty coating on the inside of my mouth that I couldn’t shift. I’ve never set foot in a McDonald’s since.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/02/want-to-lose-weight-binge-on-burgers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Documentary reveals evidence confirming a British spy’s role in restoring the Shah in 1953 – and how the Observer exposed the plot</p><p>The hidden role of a British secret service officer who led the coup that permanently altered the Middle East is to be revealed for the first time since an <em>Observer</em> news story was suppressed in 1985.</p><p>The report, headlined “How MI6 and CIA joined forces to plot Iran coup”, appeared in the 26 May edition but was swiftly quashed. It exposed the fact that an MI6 man, Norman Darbyshire, had run a covert and violent operation to reinstate the Shah of Iran as ruler of the country in 1953. Yet just a few days after the newspaper came out, all fresh evidence of this British operation and of Darbyshire’s identity disappeared from public debate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/02/mi6-the-coup-in-iran-that-changed-the-middle-east-and-the-cover-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hassan Akkad fled Damascus after he was tortured by Assad’s regime. But nothing prepared him for his job as a cleaner on a Covid-19 ward in London…</p><p> There have been times in the past 10 years, Hassan Akkad says, that his life has felt more like a movie. Thinking that occasionally kept him sane – and, more important, kept him going.</p><p>Akkad’s walk-on part in world events began in 2011, when as a young English teacher he put himself in the frontline of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-arab-spring-it-could-happen-again">Arab spring</a> democracy protests in his native Syria. He was beaten and imprisoned by the regime – and at one point given a face-to-face audience with Bashar al-Assad, his torturer, to plead his case.

<p>The last of Ali Smith’s seasonal series, a set of books that defines our fraught era, is also the first serious coronavirus novel <br /></p><p>I’m not sure I’ve ever looked forward to a book as eagerly as Ali Smith’s <em>Summer</em>. This is the final instalment of her seasonal quartet, a series that has already been celebrated by reviewers and readers alike. A vast and dizzyingly ambitious project – each book is written and published in just a few months – the novels seek to be as up to date as it is possible for literature to be. With the Booker-shortlisted <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/12/autumn-ali-smith-review">Autumn</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/12/autumn-ali-smith-review"> </a>published in October 2016, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/05/winter-ali-smith-review">Winter</a></em> in November 2017, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/mar/19/spring-ali-smith-review">Spring</a> </em>in March 2019, and now <em>Summer</em>, the four books are both independent novels and work together as a complex, interrelated collage of reflections on the way we live now.</p><p>Smith’s series has become a central part of my cultural life, one of the tools with which I attempt to read the moment, both a framing device and a lesson in defence against the dark arts. She says: things are bad, life is complicated; but here are Chaplin’s films and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/22/ali-smith-the-prime-of-pauline-boty"> Pauline Boty’s paintings</a>, here is Tacita Dean and Barbara Hepworth, here is Shakespeare and Dickens and Katherine Mansfield. She says: yes there’s Brexit, but here are deep shared ties of history and culture; yes there’s indefinite detention and the climate crisis, but here are people willing to lose their freedom, even their lives, to protest against them; yes there’s loss and loneliness, but here are small moments of connection, of recognition, of dignity. And yet so frantic were the headlines of 2020, so febrile the global temperature, I began to wonder if there was too much reality even for this supremely subtle and supple writer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/02/summer-by-ali-smith-review-a-remarkable-end-to-an-extraordinary-quartet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a Suffolk cider to a gin in Northumberland and a selection of malts, here’s some of the best bottles that Britain has to offer <br /></p><p><strong>Aspall Premier Cru Apple Cyder, Suffolk, UK (from £2, 50cl, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>; <a href="https://aspall.co.uk/">aspall.co.uk</a>) </strong>A staycation is an opportunity to explore one of the livelier and more creative domestic industries of recent years. Whether it’s the small producer-led renaissance of traditional drinks (all those thousands of tiny craft brewers and artisan gin distillers that have emerged in the past decade) or the irresistible rise of English and Welsh wine (the total British vineyard has tripled in size since 2000), the 21st century has so far been a vintage time for British drinks. I’d start a Tour of British booze with cider. In the east, Suffolk’s Aspall’s has been going for the best part of 300 years, and its graceful, subtly perfumed, sparkling premier cru hasn’t lost any of its charm since the family sold up to US beer giant Coors Molson in 2018. In the west, I’d go for something from modern British cider-making’s presiding genius, ex-roadie Tom Oliver in Herefordshire, such as his complex, tangy, properly appley still Oliver’s Fine Cider Traditional Dry (£3.20, 50cl, <a href="https://oliversciderandperry.co.uk/">oliversciderandperry.co.uk</a>).</p><p><strong>Hepple Gin, Northumberland, UK (£35.95, <a href="https://thewhiskyexchange.com/">thewhiskyexchange.com</a>; <a href="https://masterofmalt.com/">masterofmalt.com</a>) </strong>A British beer road trip could start in London with the brashly brilliant Beavertown Brewery and their engagingly lurid Lupuloid IPA (£2.20, 33cl, Waitrose). It’s a benchmark modern IPA, all humid hothouse hoppiness, bright citrus and ripe tropical fruitiness. Next a detour to a classic family-owned regional brewer, Cornwall’s St Austell, and their most summery beer, the superbly refreshing, zesty, Tribute Pale Ale (£1.70, 50cl, <a href="https://www.tesco.com/">Tesco</a>), before heading to the very opposite end of England, and the superb Newcastle craft brewers, Wylam, known for their intense IPAs, but in Wylam Gold English Golden Ale (£3.50, 44cl, <a href="https://wylambrewery.co.uk/">wylambrewery.co.uk</a>) they have a classic, clean, crisp summery thirst-quenching golden ale which hits several spots. Staying in the North East, you can start an exploration of modern British gin at the Hepple estate in the Northumberland moors. This pristine, vivid presentation of the joys of juniper has notes of resinous pine, citrus and spice and is, as the makers intended, a beautiful base for a martini.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/02/staycation-drinks-a-tour-of-british-tipples">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><p>The government is failing to take responsibility for its failings and turning on communities instead<br /><br /><strong></strong></p><li><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Almost a month after the government significantly eased lockdown restrictions, there are worrying signs that it may have gone too far too fast. Infection rates in England <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/putting-the-brakes-on-easing-english-covid-19-lockdown-may-not-be-enough">are </a>increasing: one in 1,500 individuals is now estimated to be infected with Covid-19, up from one in 2,000 in early July, and the spread is now happening across the nation – in homes, workplaces, transport systems and pubs and restaurants – rather than being mostly limited to the healthcare sector. In the week that international data confirmed that England so far has experienced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/30/covid-19-england-had-highest-excess-death-levels-in-europe-by-end-of-may">the worst excess mortality</a> in the whole of Europe, leaving tens of thousands of families mourning loved ones taken from them too soon, this only serves as a stark reminder that there may be more pain yet to come.</p><p>Caught between a moment when the exponential spread of Covid-19 has been curtailed, but before there is a vaccine available, we are at an incredibly precarious point. The only way of stopping the spread of the virus remains through adaptations to human behaviour. Yet the collective sense that “we are all in it together”, which was so important in encouraging people to stick with the lockdown restrictions, seems to be at risk of breaking down as ministers seek to shift the blame on to the public for the rise in infection rates while individual MPs have made attempts to pin rising infection rates on Britain’s south Asian communities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/02/the-observer-view-on-deflecting-the-covid-19-blame-risks-opening-fatal-divisions">Continue reading...</a>
