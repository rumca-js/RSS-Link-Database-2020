We look at the HDR performance of the 2020/2021 Vizio P-Series Quantum X (PQX)- the 75" version (sorry, not the 86"). It's got a peak brightness of 2,800nits with 792 full array local dimming zones, 48Gb/s HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K 120 gaming, and the SmartCast OS is faster than ever. Not bad for $2,000!
