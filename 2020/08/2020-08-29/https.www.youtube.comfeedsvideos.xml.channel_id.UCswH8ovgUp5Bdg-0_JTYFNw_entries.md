My #UnderTheSkin podcast with the great spiritual teacher #Mooji. You can listen to my weekly podcast over on Luminary - get it here: http://luminary.link/russell

Mooji is a renowned spiritual teacher, who, for over 20 years, has been guiding countless seekers worldwide in search of true happiness, peace and freedom. 

Mooji’s way of teaching is direct and compassionate, encouraging that Self-discovery need not be difficult. He teaches that the true nature of human beings is not a personal self or ego but pure, formless awareness. 

Mooji claims that when this is fully grasped, delusion and suffering come to an end and is replaced by a lasting peace and pure love. His talks, called Satsang, bring seekers into the experiential recognition of their true Self—and all with his characteristic humour, wisdom and love. 
His teachings are widely available online, and more info can be found at mooji.org.
