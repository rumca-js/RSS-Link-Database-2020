Back then, they were making the Channel 4 comedy series The Adam And Joe Show, in which the two of them brilliantly, and with often astonishing prescience, satirised pop culture: in a segment titled <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EZTaEh-inM]\" title=\"\">The 1980s House</a>, they sent up a then-nascent obsession with nostalgia TV (\u201cEarly mornings on television in the 80s were very different from today: there were only three and a half channels, all showing popular comedy rodents\u201d); they recreated revered films and sitcoms with stuffed animals (<a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-adam-and-joe-show/on-demand/26408-005\" title=\"\">Toy</a><a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-adam-and-joe-show/on-demand/26408-005\" title=\"\">tanic</a>! <a href=\"https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-adam-and-joe-show/on-demand/24372-006\" title=\"\">Furends!</a>).

A former travel editor for the Sunday Telegraph, Nigel was also regular guest BaaadDad on The Adam And Joe Show, where Buxton and Cornish riffed on Nigel\u2019s conservative persona, getting him to review, witheringly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/prodigy\" title=\"\">the Prodigy</a> singles and Tribal Gathering. BaaadDad was beloved by fans, but by the time we met he was a frail 89-year-old, his son now protecting him rather than directing him, gently helping him up steps and prompting his memory. As for Buxton, he seemed a little lost, with Cornish now pursuing a film career (he wrote and directed the sci-fi comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/12/attack-the-block-review\" title=\"\">Attack </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/12/attack-the-block-review\" title=\"\">The Block</a>, and co-wrote <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review\" title=\"\">The Adventures </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review\" title=\"\">Of Tintin: The Secret </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review\" title=\"\">The Unicorn</a>).
