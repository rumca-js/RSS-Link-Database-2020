## Denise Mina: 'I couldn't read until I was about nine'

<p>The acclaimed crime author on being a late bloomer, how we decide which victims to care about, and her affinity with Glasgow</p><p>Denise Mina was born in East Kilbride in 1966 and now lives in Glasgow. Her novels include <em>The Long Drop</em>, which won the Gordon Burn prize,<em> </em>and<em> The End of the Wasp Season</em>, winner of the Theakstons Old Peculier crime novel of the year award. Mina also writes short stories and plays, and is a regular contributor to TV and radio. Her new novel, <em>The Less Dead</em>, tells the story of Margo, who discovers that her birth mother was a murdered sex worker.</p><p><strong>Can you tell </strong><strong>us </strong><strong>about the </strong><strong>title </strong><strong>of your latest novel?<br /></strong>“The less dead” started to be used about victims who don’t attract a huge amount of emotional outpouring, such as street sex workers and the homeless. A lot of cases are cold cases because eyewitnesses didn’t bother coming forward. I wanted to write about the murders of sex workers that happened in Glasgow in the late 80s and 90s. The last victim came from a really lovely family and they went on <em>Crimewatch</em> and people really cared about it, but the other cases were not treated like that. It’s a wider societal value system about how you prioritise victims. In a time of Black Lives Matter, acknowledging that some people are perceived to have value attached to them and others aren’t is really important.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/29/denise-mina-i-couldnt-read-until-i-was-about-nine-crime-fiction-less-dead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yes, you get to wear elasticated trousers – but the office has a lot to recommend it</p><p>When people say they now prefer working from home (WFH), do they realise what they’re letting themselves in for in the long term? Recently, I wrote about how the pandemic meant that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/08/we-homeworkers-have-been-rumbled-our-tribe-is-under-threat">homeworkers like myself were busted</a>: people had wised up to our cushy little number. No commute. “Stylish”, elasticated-waist loungewear. Social media for interaction or if you urgently need to show people your old goth photos. However, there is a distinction: I’m a long-term, pre-Covid-19 homeworker. I <em>chose</em> WFH. It didn’t choose me. Could the same be said of people who were introduced to it by a pandemic?</p><p>To be clear, I’m against “get back to work or lose your job” government-sanctioned scaremongering. If people don’t feel safe commuting or in workspaces, that’s to be respected. Similarly, if employers adopt WFH, or flexible working, that’s their call. Not the government, not property billionaires. However, let’s not get cavalier about sandwich shop workers or any others whose city-based jobs are at risk. While it’s not our responsibility, it’s their reality. Likewise, the prospect of “ghost towns” - the loss of footfall, commerce, vibrancy. I don’t expect people to risk their health just so I can have “swinging London” as my backdrop. Still, don’t such things need to be considered, not shrugged off as of being of no consequence?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/29/working-from-home-might-feel-great-now-but-do-you-want-make-a-career-of-it">Continue reading...</a>

It included a commercial that had the Rolling Stones’ Start Me Up as a soundtrack. The symbolism of this was that in order to get Win95 rolling you had to press the “Start” button. (Satirists quickly noted that in order to turn the operating system <em>off</em> you also had to press the Start button, but the joke was clearly lost on Microsoft’s designers.) It was variously reported that the company had paid the Stones between $8m and $14m for the right to use the song, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95">Microsoft said</a> that this was just a rumour spread by the band to increase their market value, and that the company actually paid a fraction of that amount.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/29/lets-not-forget-bill-gates-hasnt-always-been-the-good-guy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Aleppo to Palmyra, many of the country’s architectural treasures have been reduced to rubble, but restoration has begun</p><p>The centre of Aleppo was a marvel. It was a demonstration of the multiplicity of both humanity and stone. It was an embodiment of the material and cultural wealth that once made Syria one of the luckiest and most civilised places on Earth – a California of the Middle East, blessed by climate, fertile land, physical beauty and its position between the Mediterranean and the Silk Road to the east. “My beautiful province,” as the seventh-century Byzantine emperor Heraclius called Syria, while retreating from Muslim conquerors, “what a paradise you will be for the enemy!”</p><p>In Aleppo there was, and mostly still is, the citadel, a mound growing upwards into improbably massive walls, a dream of castle-ness realised with crushing weight. Then there were the souks, a huge web of covered alleys and streets, spaces made of produce and transactions as much as of masonry, in which gems of architecture – a polychrome portal or a serene dome – would make themselves known amid the action and clutter, their arabesque decorations indecorously garlanded with electrical conduits and air-conditioning units.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/29/how-syrias-blasted-cities-are-rising-from-the-ruins">Continue reading...</a>

Gripped by this morbid knowledge she floats around her sparsely decorated Los Angeles home in a dreamlike stupor, drinking white wine, stroking the walls and browsing ceramic urns on the internet. She plays Mozart’s Requiem on repeat. Her scientist friend Jane (Jane Adams) attempts to reassure her but Amy’s paranoia is catching and it’s not long before Jane too is certain of her own impending death.</p><p>Jane’s pyjama-clad attendance at a house party has a knock-on effect, propelling each guest to make his or her final arrangements. Hallucinatory neon reds, blues, greens and purples wash over terrified faces.

<p>The singer, 52, on discovering her talent, meeting Stevie Wonder and the downside of her religious upbringing</p><p><strong>I wouldn’t say </strong>I was religious, but I am spiritual. I believe in a greater force. When I was seven, my family became very religious. We were Jehovah’s Witnesses; we were Catholic – we tried everything before settling on United Methodist. I asked my mum once what they were searching for and she just replied: “It was the 70s.” The 70s were a very religious era. I think a lot of people were looking for the right path.</p><p><strong>I didn’t realise </strong>I could sing until my teenage years. Singing was so much a part of me and my family. We got up, we sang, we went to bed. I think at elementary school I realised I had a different tone. My voice was always low. I remember everyone in class singing Joy to the World and I was the only one who couldn’t sing it in the key. I was always the kid in the room with the low voice that made you turn around.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/29/toni-braxton-this-much-i-know-i-regret-not-having-more-sex-when-i-was-younger">Continue reading...</a>

## How to grow buddleja – and keep it blooming into autumn | Alys Fowler

<p>There are many varieties and colours beyond the feral bush of our cities and railway lines</p><p>The ubiquitous butterfly bush, <em>Buddleja davidii</em>, so fond of the cracks in our concrete world, is familiar to all, particularly those that flutter. There is, however, a world beyond the feral bush of our cities and railway lines: those with deeply scented flower spikes in pinks, deep purples, bicolours and purest whites; those that tower as tall shrubs; and those that are happy to stay small enough to live in a pot on a patio.</p><p>The place to go and see them is in the national collection at <a href="https://www.buddlejacollection.com/" title="">Longstock Gardens</a> in Hampshire. If you are passing, it is well worth dropping in to peruse the many colour variations. They are laid out in a rather splendid walled garden and there will be something in flower right into October, thanks to dedicated deadheading. If you are thinking that buddleia’s pretty spires are long gone by now, then that is the secret: when roughly half the flower spike starts to brown, remove it and this will spur the plant into producing more. Once the seed starts to set, the plant considers its job done for the summer and concentrates on producing as many babies as it can for you to weed out. If you can keep on top of deadheading, you’ll have flowers well into early autumn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/29/how-to-grow-buddleia-and-keep-it-blooming-into-autumn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The podcaster, comic and radio host has made a career out of his insecurities. But uncovering a family secret has helped him find peace</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/29/as-my-father-was-dying-i-finally-got-to-know-him-adam-buxton">Read an extract from Ramble Book</a> </li></ul><p>This is the third time I’ve met <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/adam-buxton" title="">Adam Buxton</a>, but the first time I’ve met him on his own. Our first encounter was in 2001, alongside his childhood best friend and frequent comedy partner, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/joe-cornish" title="">Joe Cornish</a>. Back then, they were making the Channel 4 comedy series The Adam And Joe Show, in which the two of them brilliantly, and with often astonishing prescience, satirised pop culture: in a segment titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EZTaEh-inM]" title="">The 1980s House</a>, they sent up a then-nascent obsession with nostalgia TV (“Early mornings on television in the 80s were very different from today: there were only three and a half channels, all showing popular comedy rodents”); they recreated revered films and sitcoms with stuffed animals (<a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-adam-and-joe-show/on-demand/26408-005" title="">Toy</a><a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-adam-and-joe-show/on-demand/26408-005" title="">tanic</a>! <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-adam-and-joe-show/on-demand/24372-006" title="">Furends!</a>). It was silly, smart and superbly of its time, and for a certain demographic – ie mine – The Adam And Joe Show remains some of the greatest TV comedy ever made.</p><p>I next met him 12 years later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/14/adam-buxton-nigel-baaadad-relationship" title="">this time with</a> his father, Nigel. A former travel editor for the Sunday Telegraph, Nigel was also regular guest BaaadDad on The Adam And Joe Show, where Buxton and Cornish riffed on Nigel’s conservative persona, getting him to review, witheringly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/prodigy" title="">the Prodigy</a> singles and Tribal Gathering. BaaadDad was beloved by fans, but by the time we met he was a frail 89-year-old, his son now protecting him rather than directing him, gently helping him up steps and prompting his memory. As for Buxton, he seemed a little lost, with Cornish now pursuing a film career (he wrote and directed the sci-fi comedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/12/attack-the-block-review" title="">Attack </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/12/attack-the-block-review" title="">The Block</a>, and co-wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review" title="">The Adventures </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review" title="">Of Tintin: The Secret </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review" title="">Of </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/oct/27/the-adventures-of-tintin-review" title="">The Unicorn</a>).

I now have so many of these to my name that I’ve been awarded a Failed TV Pilot’s Licence. This allows me to board any project and cruise at a low altitude, nearly breaking through the clouds before plunging back down to earth and crashing underwhelmingly.</p><p>I was taking selfies that made me look handsome when my sister called and said she’d just accompanied our dad to a meeting with the doctor. He’d been told he had mesothelioma, cancer of the lining of the lung. “Could be worse,” I thought. How important is a bit of lung lining? After all, if you have a favourite jacket and the lining gets knackered, you can still wear that jacket, right? According to the doctor, lungs and jackets aren’t as similar as you might think, and Dad was given three to 12 months to live. He was 91, well into bonus time but, still, it’s not what anyone wants to hear.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/29/as-my-father-was-dying-i-finally-got-to-know-him-adam-buxton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Life is still incredibly difficult out there, and the boon about working from home is that the sun is always over the yard arm</p><p>Lately, my refrigerator always contains an ice-cold bottle of vodka and at least two bottles of rosé. It is still summer, after all. Summer in semi-lockdown; that stage where the doors are open and we’re ostensibly free to leave, but outdoors is strange, so it’s easier to have a large glass of something nice on the sofa. There are no QR codes to scan, and no queuing for the bar in the same stiff manner with which one might line up to collect a hire car. Who knew that one day I’d crave the scrum and jostle of getting in a round in a heaving pub? Or miss the quaint Britishness of ferrying half-spilt drinks through a Friday night bunfight with the martyred groan of “It’s hell at that bar”?</p><p>Instead, millions of us are staying safely at home. We’re mixing our own cocktails and protecting our lungs, but I’m not so sure we’re as concerned about our livers. I began lockdown in March behaving like Sarah Connor in The Terminator: doing squats, lifting weights, drinking gallons of water, determined to live out the apocalypse. But soon the new world needed numbing and a lovely bottle of botanical gin – so fancy! – appeared in my grocery basket. Now, months later, I ask myself: am I the only one drinking more than ever?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/29/i-started-lockdown-with-the-focus-of-sarah-connor-in-terminator-now-im-drinking-more-than-ever">Continue reading...</a>
