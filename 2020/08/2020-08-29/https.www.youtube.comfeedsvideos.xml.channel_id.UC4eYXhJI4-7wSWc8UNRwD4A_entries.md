We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Los Lobos has proven time and again that a universal shared experience will always trump culture and language. The group writes music that speaks to all of us as individuals, yet can make us feel connected when we pack ourselves into a club to watch them perform.

I've been a fan of Los Lobos since I was 18 and the band was playing mariachi music on the campus of UC-Davis. I'm 52 now. I've seen many, many Los Lobos shows and even interviewed the band a handful of times, and yet I still get excited when I get a chance to see its members play.

This past summer, the group released a new album called Tin Can Trust. Thankfully, for Los Lobos, there's always a new record: songs to sing along to, stories to compare our lives to, cumbias to dance to. This short blast from behind Bob Boilen's desk has something new, something old and something to dance to. So pull the chairs back and grab a partner — it's time to dance.

Set List:
"Burn It Down"
"Yo Canto"
"Don't Worry Baby"
