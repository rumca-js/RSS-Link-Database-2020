Languishing in the German fifth tier just over 10 years ago, the club formerly known as SSV Markranstädt’s rapid ascent to the status of Big Cup semi-finalists has been as heartwarming as it has been remarkable … if hosing hundreds of millions of quid at a team in order to plaster it with the livery of a pungent, sickly-sweet energy drink empire is your idea of what constitutes a footballing fairytale.

The most popular universities, which typically over-offer to make sure they fill their places, are now obliged to take students who’ve achieved their grades.

<p>I moved in with my new partner just before lockdown. Her high libido has led me to take medication – and made me fearful for our future<br /></p><p><strong>I’m a 52-year-old man </strong><strong>and moved in with my new-ish partner (</strong><strong>a 53-year-old woman) </strong><strong>this year, ahead of the </strong><strong>coronavirus lock</strong><strong>down. </strong><strong>We enjoy sex </strong><strong>about three times a week. She finds this insufficient and can become ill-tempered, and even angry, if she feels her desires are not being met or taken seriously. Similar dissatisfactions contributed to the collapse of her 25-year marriage four years ago. On occasion, her anger has </strong><strong>turned to aggression, which I find unacceptable. This has placed our relationship under strain. Without her knowledge, I sometimes take </strong><strong>erectile dysfunction medication in an effort to </strong><strong>“keep up”</strong><strong>, as it were. I love this woman and enjoy our intimacy, but </strong><strong>I’m beginning to fear for our future. Any advice appreciated.</strong></p><p>Your penis is not only connected to your sexual desire, but also to your feelings of fear and resentment. In a way, it is being uncooperative in order to protect you. You are clearly afraid – not just of the future, but of her – and that is certainly unacceptable and is affecting your erectile ability. In order to enjoy true intimacy – and function sexually the way you want – you need to feel safe, so it is important to address this issue with her. You could say: “I really enjoy making love with you, but sometimes I feel pressure from you to perform, and that puts me off. Can we please talk about finding a solution?” Listen to her and learn exactly what is important to her. Is it just pleasure, or perhaps she feels insecure and needs the validation of sex? Avoid blaming, but be frank about your feelings. Seek answers together. This conversation could save your sex life – and your relationship.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/18/i-love-my-partner-but-her-sexual-aggression-has-become-a-big-problem-what-should-i-do">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Going to the toilet used to be a public activity. Will Japan’s see-through stalls take us back to the days before the S-bend brought lavatories indoors? </p><p>At the Happiness and Prosperity service station in the rural reaches of Sichuan province, I prepared to face the public toilet. We had been driving for hours, and my need was urgent, but I still hesitated. Not because the service station was unclean: the restaurant was pristine, and the food cheap and fabulous. It was because of the doors. There wouldn’t be any.</p><p>I asked my translator if there was an etiquette. Where should I look? What is considered rude? I had no idea, because this was turning all my concepts of public and private upside down. I knew that some schools and institutions in the western world had doorless toilets, the better to foster compliance or – in the case of the military – to extract individuality. But I grew up in a culture that provided privacy abundantly and without question. I like doors. At the Happiness and Prosperity service station, I knew I would miss them. So how did I do it? By studiously not looking at the line of women who had graciously – or pruriently – let me go first, and by building doors in my mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/18/tokyo-toilets-may-be-transparent-but-at-least-theyre-building-some">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Christianity has been predicting an imminent apocalypse since its earliest days but the world only burns if we let it</p><p>As death was raging across 14th-century Europe, the church gathered the people together. God is mad, they told the people. We must ask for forgiveness so he will stop trying to kill us. The flagellants went on the march, dressed in linen hoods, slapping themselves for God and begging for the absolution of people’s many sins. And, yes, further spreading the plague wherever they went.</p><p>The professors at the University of Paris’s school of medicine decreed the plague had been caused by “a disturbance in the skies [that] had caused the sun to overheat the oceans near India, and the waters had begun to give off noxious vapors”, in the words of Otto Friedrich in The End of the World. (As to what would cure it: broth and enemas.) So it’s not like the people at the time had a sophisticated scientific knowledge about disease and contagion. Which makes one wonder, watching all of the US Christians crowd together in their churches both mega and modest as the coronavirus spreads, what’s their excuse?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/18/the-end-of-the-world-is-nigh-all-the-more-reason-to-help-each-other-here-and-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The centennial raises discomfort among feminists in part because of a long overdue examination of the partial, fragmented and compromised nature of the amendment</p><p>One uncomfortable reality of history is how much even seismic events are shaped by the personalities of their principal actors. The vanities, prejudices, nostalgias, misguided affections and petty rivalries of historical figures can at times play a greater role in the unfolding of events than we would like to admit, and there are moments when reckoning with the human failings of long-dead individuals can cast a pall on even their most noble achievements. Perhaps nowhere is this more evident than in the ongoing, palpable discomfort of feminists over how to how to mark the centennial of the 19th amendment, the constitutional triumph that removed sex-based restrictions on voting rights.</p><p>The discomfort arises in part because of a long overdue popular examination of the partial, fragmented and compromised nature of the amendment. Thanks to the efforts of Black historians and public intellectuals, there is a growing acknowledgement that the 19th amendment did not, per se, grant women the right to vote, so much as it removed the remaining laws that said women could not vote because they were women. But like the 15th amendment, which granted Black men the franchise in theory but often not in practice, the 19th amendment left intact restrictions on women’s enfranchisement that used other pretexts to keep women from voting: women’s race, their literacy, their ancestors’ enfranchisement or lack thereof, and their wealth were left intact as reasons why racists, sexists and others hostile to women’s political participation could justify prohibiting them from voting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/18/the-19th-amendment-is-a-reminder-that-the-right-to-vote-is-unfinished-business">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They’ll blow bubbles, sing songs and deliver lectures about urbanism. Our writer goes behind the scenes at architecture’s Antepavilion prize – and finds out why this year’s winning entry has bite</p><p>‘We don’t do planning,” says Russell Gray, “or regulations, or any of that bollocks.” The property developer is standing in his canal-side warehouse in Hackney, London, next to a gigantic model of a prehistoric shark with blood stains smeared around its gaping mouth. “We’re about liberating the arts and architecture from institutional control.”<br /><br />This week, Gray is launching a shiver of sharks into Regent’s Canal: five polystyrene and fibreglass beasts equipped with smoke machines, laser beams and speakers. Some will even blow bubbles out of their mouths. Over the coming weeks, the sharks will sing songs and give lectures to each other on the subject of architecture and urbanism. This is the latest iteration of the <a href="https://antepavilion.org/">Antepavilion</a>, an annual commission organised by Gray’s company, Shiva, in collaboration with the Architecture Foundation. That’s if the council doesn’t confiscate the fearsome creatures first.<br /><br />Gray has a long record of baiting the authorities. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandela_Way_T-34_Tank">He once parked a tank on a site in Southwark</a> over a feud with the council. Its gun is still pointing at the planners’ offices. More recently, he has locked horns with Hackney council over structures erected on the roof of <a href="https://www.hoxtondocks.com/">Hoxton Docks</a>, a complex of artists’ studios and spaces in a jumble of old wharf buildings that he bought in the late 1980s. “The planners say it’s all ‘incongruous’,” he tells me, referring to the menagerie of structures his rooftop has acquired over the years. “Who are they to depreciate our interventions with that term?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/18/sharks-man-eaters-unleashed-popular-canal-architecture-antepavilion-prize">Continue reading...</a>

A Taste for Death starts with one of the most foul descriptions of murder you are likely to find in fiction.</p><p>James starts by carefully leading us to the bodies in the company of an innocent old woman and a child, who are walking along a canal path to a church and admiring the flowers. When they get to the church door, an unaccountable anxiety builds; they detect “a faint smell alien, yet horribly familiar” before throwing open the door and seeing “horror itself” in a blaze of light:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/aug/18/i-prefer-a-more-domestic-the-thrilling-nastiness-of-pd-james">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a new book, the Croat recounts a secret discussion with Chelsea’s owner which led to a transfer request at Spurs</p><p>With the 2010-11 Premier League season over, I was ready for my summer vacation. But it didn’t last long, as my agents – Vlado Lemić and Davor Ćurković – passed on Chelsea’s wish to sign me. Before transferring to Tottenham, it had seemed I would move to Stamford Bridge. This new contact only added to the impression that Chelsea thought highly of me.</p><p>I was open to the idea of moving, but then things happened at lightning speed. First, Vanja and I took a private jet from Zadar to Cannes, where my management team were waiting. Then, a van with tinted-glass windows took us to Nice, some 30km away. There we were picked up by Roman Abramovich’s security, who put us on a speedboat and took us to the Chelsea owner’s yacht.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/18/luka-modric-roman-abramovich-brought-me-onto-his-yacht-and-said-sign-for-chelsea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Comedy writer Nicole Tersigni got fed up of men explaining her own jokes back to her. So she paired their patronising comments with classical art – and went viral </p><p>It began with a tweet. Nicole Tersigni was scrolling through Twitter when she stumbled upon a man explaining one of her friend’s jokes back to her – something she’d experienced several times herself – and decided to make a joke of her own. “I got on Google Images and searched ‘woman surrounded by men’. Because that’s what it feels like when you’re online. That image popped up – the one where the woman has her boob out. I was like, that is hilarious and perfect.”</p><p>With her caption – “maybe if I take my tit out they will stop explaining my own joke back to me” – that image, a 17th-century painting by the German artist Jobst Harrich, became the first tweet in a thread that quickly went viral. Tersigni kept at it, finding more paintings of men talking to women and women looking vacant, and coupling them with deadpan captions in which men share their insights on topics such as breastfeeding and period pain. Tersigni’s agent, Rachel Sussman, suggested that the thread could be a book. As Tersigni says: “People get it and they want to laugh about it with other people who understand and have been there.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/18/nicole-tersigni-men-to-avoid-in-art-and-life-sexism-classical-art">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Twenty years ago the bowler switched ends at Headingley and ripped out four wickets for only the sixth time in Test history</p><p>Before England’s second match against Pakistan 4,938,971 deliveries had been bowled in the history of Test cricket, equivalent to 823,161 (and a bit) six-ball overs, and of those only six have featured four wickets. About a quarter of one percent of the 2,392 Tests to have been played have had a four-wicket over, falling to only a tenth of a percent of the 912 Tests played since the turn of this century. Weirdly, three of those six four-wicket overs were bowled at Headingley, where Test bowlers are more than 15 times more likely to take four wickets in an over than anywhere else.</p><p>This Tuesday marks the 20th anniversary of the last time it happened, at Headingley or anywhere else. Andy Caddick was the bowler, a player who, just a few months from his 32nd birthday, was in the best form of his international life. Given his debut in 1993 under the captaincy of Graham Gooch, Caddick had been in and out of the side under his successor, Michael Atherton, and entirely out of the side under Alec Stewart, but his international fortunes were transformed by the near-simultaneous arrivals of Nasser Hussain as captain, Duncan Fletcher as coach, and central contracts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/18/when-andy-caddick-took-four-test-wickets-for-england-in-a-single-over-the-spin-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former England captain’s enlightening autobiography could loosen a few tongues among his less forthright successors<br /></p><p>It was always likely that Dylan Hartley’s soon-to-be published autobiography would cause a ripple or two. Few rugby players have managed to divide opinion so reliably or reinvent themselves so successfully; dull anonymity has rarely been the former England captain’s speciality. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/14/dylan-hartley-reveals-eddie-joness-brutal-three-word-end-england-phone-call-rugby-union">The initial passages to emerge from his book</a>, The Hurt, are both forthright and striking.</p><p>Perhaps most significant of all, however, is the harsh light Hartley shines on rugby itself. Not since Jonny Wilkinson’s slightly disturbing autobiography has a high-profile England player made his day job sound more wince-inducing. “My generation of players have been crash dummies for a sport in transition from semi-professionalism,” he writes, suggesting the game’s money men treat those who take the field like “human widgets” and revealing that he discouraged his family from visiting the team hotel on days off “because it would have felt like a prison visit”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/18/dylan-hartley-england-tales-rugby-union-no-place-to-hide">Continue reading...</a>

A 24ft sperm whale had been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/20/sperm-whale-coast-of-sicily-salina-fishing-netting">found</a> thrashing about in the waters north of Sicily, desperately trying to escape a vast illegal drift net. “They asked me to help cut it loose because I have a lot of experience with these kinds of nets,” says Isgrò, a marine biologist and director of the Museum of the Sea in the Sicilian town of Milazzo. “So I got a very big knife and went straight away.”</p><p>Isgrò was among a team of divers who tried for 48 hours to free the agitated female whale, as the miles-long trap gradually sliced further into her thick skin. “It was a very difficult operation because the whale was so powerful, and if you are struck by its tail you could be killed,” says Isgrò. The team were able to remove parts of the netting, but the whale, whose tail was still tangled up, dived deep into the ocean and they lost track.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/18/walls-of-death-surge-in-illegal-drift-nets-threatens-endangered-species">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New year 7s will have missed out on rites of passage and been unable to visit their new school. But there are silver linings</p><p>The good news – and more than good, in some ways it feels miraculous – is that 11-year-old Phoebe South is genuinely looking forward to starting secondary school in September. “I feel quite excited about it now,” she tells me, from a beach in Devon where she’s on holiday with her family. “I know one of my best friends is going to be in the same bubble as me, and I know quite a lot about what to expect.”</p><p>That she feels this way is tribute to all the work of her new school, Wykham Park academy in Banbury, Oxfordshire, to prepare for the influx of year 7 students in a few weeks’ time. Transition to secondary school can be difficult in the best of years – and 2020 is far from that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/aug/18/starting-secondary-school-during-a-pandemic-what-parents-need-to-know">Continue reading...</a>

There are no fruit machines or KFC here.</p><p>A longstanding hotel and conference centre near Cheshunt, the imposing 22-hectare, Grade II-listed property has been the subject of a radical makeover by Chris Penn, former managing director of US brand Ace Hotels. The Birch ethos, Penn told me, is to “give a shit”, to be “accessible,” to be “a festival at a hotel” or perhaps not even be a hotel at all. Rather, a space for “escape artists” – those wishing to get away from the relentless pace of London, a 30-minute train ride away to the south.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/aug/18/overall-its-like-the-most-chaotic-pinterest-board-made-real-birch-hertfordshire-review">Continue reading...</a>

The play begins and ends with her making a statement about humanity, rather than just on being Jewish or a gentile.”</p><p>She’s thrilled about the role – originally made famous by <a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/olympia-dukakis-documentary-review-1234702655/">Olympia Dukakis</a> – and makes the point that, by the time you hit 74, parts don’t just end up in your lap. She’s also in Coronation Street, of course, and describes fitting the two filming schedules in with the unsociable hours and the midnight taxis of the actor in high demand.

But in announcing this without setting out a plan for what it means for university admissions – some institutions will now be massively oversubscribed in terms of places, others undersubscribed – it has simply pushed the problem elsewhere.</p><p>Step back, and this whole fiasco exposes some uncomfortable truths about how fair the system is normally, and the true extent of and limits to meritocracy. We take it as given that dropping a couple of grades in a one-off exam should amount to the be-all and end-all in determining which university you go to. Have a good exam day, and you could be attending the university of your dreams; have a bad day and the anxious cycle of clearing starts.

<p>As the government made excuses for not providing adequate equipment, Josiane refused to stop caring for the Covid-19 patients who needed her. Soon she was admitted to the ICU, too</p><p>After a busy night shift at the hospital, there was nothing the nurse Josiane Ekoli liked to do more than come home and wake up her sleeping children. Her 22-year-old son, Kenan, a finance worker, got the worst of it, because his bedroom was the closest to the front door. “Oh my days,” Kenan groans. “Every day, I’m hearing my name, without a doubt. She’s screaming my name. <em>Kenan! Kenan! </em>She knew I hated being woken up.”</p><p>On Saturday mornings, when Josiane had not come off a night shift, she had a routine: at about 9am, she would blast gospel music through the house. If that did not get her children up – she had five, but two of her sons had moved out – she would go into their rooms and start talking to them. At them, really. “Sometimes, she woke me up just to talk,” says Kenan. “I’d say: ‘Mum, couldn’t you wait until I was awake to have this conversation?’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/18/josiane-ekoli-was-a-brilliant-nurse-and-mother-of-five-would-the-right-ppe-have-saved-her-life-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Windrush scandal brought the cruelty of Britain’s deportation policies to light, but the practice continues to this day – and shockingly, it is made possible by UK aid money. By Luke de Noronha</p><p>Sitting in the computer room of Open Arms drop-in centre, a homeless shelter in Kingston, Jamaica, I turned on my recorder and asked Jason to tell me about his life there. In his distinct east London accent, he described arguments and fights with other residents – about chores, use of the showers, missing possessions. Then, checking no one was around, he complained about the management, claiming that they spoke to him like a child and had threatened to kick him out. Nor did he feel safe when he left the shelter. “People are trying to kill me down here. I need to get back to England,” he said. But having been deported from the UK, and finding himself destitute in Jamaica, he had few options. Jason had been exiled home.</p><p>Jason was born in 1984 in Kingston. When he was about five, his mother and grandmother moved to the UK, and so for most of his childhood he was raised by his aunties in Kingston. He had a good childhood in Jamaica. For his wider family, though, the option to move to the UK was viewed as “the dream ticket”, and so, in August 2000, when he was 15, Jason and his 13-year-old brother were put on a flight to London to join their mother. (The official story was that they were just planning to visit their grandmother for a few weeks.) This was the first time Jason had ever been on a plane, and it remains the only commercial flight he has taken.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/aug/18/deportation-jamaica-britain-windrush-scandal-foreign-aid">Continue reading...</a>
