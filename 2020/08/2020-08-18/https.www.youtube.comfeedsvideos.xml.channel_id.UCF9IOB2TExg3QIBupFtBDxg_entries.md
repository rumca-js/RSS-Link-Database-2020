Humidity is a consistent climatic factor contributing to SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission (August, 2020, Sydney / Shanghai)

Spread of SARS-CoV-2

Respiratory droplets and aerosols

Fomites

Faecal–oral

Effects of humidity

Cold air holds less moisture

Warm air holds more moisture

Muggy summers and crisp winters

Exhaled droplets become smaller in dry air when they have less moisture to become enveloped in

Smaller infectious aerosols can stay suspended in the air for longer

In humid air the aerosols are larger and heavier, so they fall out of the air

Indoor heating dries things further through evaporation

Indoor aircon also reduces humidity

Climatic and behavioural factors could influence the evolution of the current COVID‐19 pandemic

Method

Southern hemisphere summer and autumn period

Locally transmitted infections

Relationship between climatic factors and cases in New South Wales

During both the exponential and declining phases in 2020

Results

Increased relative humidity was associated with decreased cases in both epidemic phases

A consistent negative relationship was found between relative humidity and cases

Higher humidity, less disease

Lower humidity, more disease

Similar negative relationship with SARS – 1 and MERS coronavirus

A decrease in relative humidity of 1% was associated with an increase in cases of 7–8%

No relationship with between cases and temperature, rainfall or wind speed

(virus does survive for longer at cool temperatures)

Consistent with work carried out in the Chinese winter

Study confirms low humidity as a driver of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission

Combined with poor ventilation

Reasons low humidity causes more spread

Respiratory aerosols remaining airborne for longer in low humidity

Survivability of the virus increased in lower humidity

Survivability of the virus decreased in higher humidity

Applications

Could increasing relative humidity contribute to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections when infectious individuals mix with susceptible individuals?

Indoor when cold with heating

Indoors when hot with air-con

Long term immunity

It would be good if,

Antibodies provide “real-world” protection

Cellular immunity is long-lasting

Memory B and T lymphocytes

T helpers, suppressors, killers (cytotoxic)

Even in mild cases.

Moscow 21.7 %

Stockholm 10 %

New York 6.9 %

London 17.5 %

UK 6.2 %


Marion Pepper, immunologist, University of Washington

This is exactly what you would hope for

All the pieces are there to have a totally protective immune response

Smita Iyer, immunologist, University of California, Davis

This is very promising

This calls for some optimism about herd immunity, and potentially a vaccine 

Professor Danny Altmann, Department of Immunology and Inflammation, Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial College

While this is a small study, it offers a remarkable, real-life, human experiment at a time when we've been short of hard-line, formal, proof that neutralising antibodies genuinely offer protection from re-infection

In short, it’s good news

Neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection from SARS-CoV-2 in humans during a fishery vessel outbreak with high attack rate

University of Washington IRB

Identification of immunological correlates would help research

Only animal models to date

Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 on a fishing boat

Attack rate on board of 85.2% (104/122 individuals)

Predeparture serological and viral RT-PCR testing

Repeat testing after return to shore

Full data on 120 of the 122 crew (9 women)

18 day trip, crew member required hospitalization

Median follow-up of 32.5 days

104 individuals had a positive antigen test or seroconverted during the follow-up period

101 developed IgG antibodies within 50 days

Also

Three crew members seropositive prior to the boat's departure

None of these crew members with antibodies developed symptoms or tested antigen positive

Lab studies also showed their antibodies had neutralising activity

Presence of neutralizing antibodies from prior infection was significantly associated with protection against re-infection (p=0.002).

Robust T cell immunity in convalescent individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19

Center for Infectious Medicine, Stockholm

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.29.174888v1

Virus-specific memory T cells have been shown to persist for many years after infection with SARS-CoV-1 

Acute phase SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells display high cytotoxic activity

Correlated with various clinical markers of disease severity

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detectable in antibody-seronegative family members

and individuals with a history of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19

Collective dataset shows that SARS-CoV-2 elicits robust memory T cell responses

akin to those observed in the context of successful vaccines

natural exposure or infection may prevent recurrent episodes of severe COVID-19 also in seronegative individuals.

SARS-CoV-2 induces robust memory T cell responses in antibody-seronegative and antibody-seropositive individuals with asymptomatic or mild COVID-19.



Functional SARS-CoV-2-specific immune memory persists after mild COVID-19

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.11.20171843v2

Study was approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board

The recently emerged SARS-CoV-2 virus is currently causing a global pandemic and cases continue to rise. 

The majority of infected individuals experience mildly symptomatic disease

but it is unknown whether this can induce persistent immune memory that might contribute to herd immunity

Longitudinal assessment

Individuals recovered from mildly symptomatic COVID-19

To determine if they develop and sustain immunological memory

Recovered individuals developed SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG antibody

As well as virus-specific memory B and T cells

In some cases increased numerically over three months following symptom onset

Memory lymphocytes exhibited characteristics associated with potent antiviral immunity

Memory T cells secreted IFN-γ (interferon Gama) and expanded upon antigen re-encounter

Memory B cells expressed specific antibodies
