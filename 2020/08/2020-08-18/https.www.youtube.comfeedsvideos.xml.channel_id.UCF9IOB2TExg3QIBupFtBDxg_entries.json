of SARS-CoV-2\n\nRespiratory droplets and aerosols\n\nFomites\n\nFaecal\u2013oral\n\nEffects of humidity\n\nCold air holds less moisture\n\nWarm air holds more moisture\n\nMuggy summers and crisp winters\n\nExhaled droplets become smaller in dry air when they have less moisture to become enveloped in\n\nSmaller infectious aerosols can stay suspended in the air for longer\n\nIn humid air the aerosols are larger and heavier, so they fall out of the air\n\nIndoor heating dries things further through evaporation\n\nIndoor aircon also reduces humidity\n\nClimatic and behavioural factors could influence the evolution of the current COVID\u201019 pandemic\n\nMethod\n\nSouthern hemisphere summer and autumn period\n\nLocally transmitted infections\n\nRelationship between climatic factors and cases in New South Wales\n\nDuring both the exponential and declining phases in 2020\n\nResults\n\nIncreased relative humidity was associated with decreased cases in both epidemic phases\n\nA consistent negative relationship was found between relative humidity and cases\n\nHigher humidity, less disease\n\nLower humidity, more disease\n\nSimilar negative relationship with SARS \u2013 1 and MERS coronavirus\n\nA decrease in relative humidity of 1% was associated with an increase in cases of 7\u20138%\n\nNo relationship with between cases and temperature, rainfall or wind speed\n\n(virus does survive for longer at cool temperatures)\n\nConsistent with work carried out in the Chinese winter\n\nStudy confirms low humidity as a driver of SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 transmission\n\nCombined with poor ventilation\n\nReasons low humidity causes more spread\n\nRespiratory aerosols remaining airborne for longer in low humidity\n\nSurvivability of the virus increased in lower humidity\n\nSurvivability of the virus decreased in higher humidity\n\nApplications\n\nCould increasing relative humidity contribute to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infections when infectious individuals
