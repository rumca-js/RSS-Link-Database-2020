Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. Today I will talk about Sony's new VR headset that they have confirmed they are currently working on. This is more than likely NOT a playstation VR headset and is likely a headset to compete closely with something like the Oculus Quest. I have certain hopes and dreams for what it is though. I also talk about some Pokemon VR, new hilarious apple VR patents, and more.
