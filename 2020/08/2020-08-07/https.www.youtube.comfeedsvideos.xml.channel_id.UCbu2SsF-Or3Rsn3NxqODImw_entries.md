Everyone in the world of Cyberpunk 2077 knows the name Johnny Silverhand. He's a veteran, a rockerboy and, above all, a revolutionary. In an inspired stroke of casting, he's also being portrayed by Keanu Reeves in CD Projekt Red's upcoming first person RPG. In preparation for its November release, we're going to look back at the origins and history of this key character so you'll fully understand his role when you begin your adventure in Night City.

So what even is a rockerboy? In this video, Jake explains the class, which is unique to Cyberpunk's fiction, and how Johnny embodies this role through his music and anti-corporate ideologies. These ideologies came straight from his experiences as an American soldier during the underhanded Central American Conflict. This also happens to be where he lost his arm. With a prosthetic replacement, Silverhand changed his name and started the band Samurai, which was his conduit for speaking out against the status quo. 

We also get the skinny on Johnny's tragic lost love, and a hatred for the mega corp Arasaka that now drives him in a post-Samurai world. We don't know much about the role Reeves's electronic ghost will be playing in V's story, other than that it will likely be significant. We'll have to wait for the game's release for more specifics and to see how Reeves's voice acting and motion capture for the character turned out. "Wake the f*ck up, Samurai, we have a city to burn."

## Top 5 Call of Duty: Warzone Moments Of The Week

Call of Duty season 5 is finally here! That means new operators, weapons and of course- awesome moments to behold! The CoD community is already testing the strength of the new train, flooding the newly opened stadium, and picking on the returning Juggernauts. Here’s a breakdown of our top 5 moments for the first week of August.

Our first clip is from Reddit user CommanderKittyPwn. Juggernauts have returned to Warzone (for now) and Commander and his crew aren’t welcoming them back with open arms. His entire squad is able to pin the jug in a doorway using their riot shields. Once he’s pinned, the squad unloads their weapons and melee away until he’s down. Next up is a clip from RilesJenkins on Reddit. After a loadout drop falls onto the blades of his helicopter, he tries to juggle it to get it to fall off. Unfortunately, this backfires and destroys his helicopter, downing him in the process.

Our next clip is from GammonRod on Reddit, who tries to make a friend on the battlefield. Surprisingly, it works! The pair drive around, honking their horns and sharing loadouts. Unfortunately, Gammon’s new friend accidentally uses a pit maneuver on his SUV- flipping them both around and causing Gammon to squish his new friend. Gone but never forgotten…

Stopping the new train is impossible right? BoldWarrior14 and his friends attempt to find out. Using 4 of the biggest cargo trucks, the crew blocks the train’s path in hopes to debunk this mystery. As expected, the train plows through all four trucks without even slowing down. Nice try anyway, boys! Last but not least is InFinZible from Reddit, who faces death by an RPG. In the middle of a sniper battle, an RPG comes careening towards him and his friend. Thank goodness he had a trophy system set up, because that would have been a direct hit!

Finally, Sony's State Of Play stream revealed that PSVR Support is coming to Hitman 3 when it launches early next year.

We break down the latest Apex Legends trailer, which reveals the new legend Rampart. Season 6 also adds crafting and a new weapon.

Respawn has released the first official details for Apex Legends Season 6: Boosted, and from those details we can begin to formulate a few educated guesses as to what additional content we can expect.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée details both what we know about Season 6 and what we can possibly infer about the upcoming season based on this new information. Whether or not we're right remains to be seen, though we'll find out pretty soon as Season 6 is scheduled to begin on August 18.

So far, Respawn has confirmed Season 6's new character is Rampart and its new weapon is the Volt SMG. The developer has also announced a new crafting system will be implemented in Season 6 and that the season's battle pass will include a brand-new collection of Holo-Spray items.

That's pretty much it, though. We don't know Rampart's abilities, how the Volt will behave in combat, how crafting will work, or what Holo-Sprays will look like. However, based on in-game clues and map changes, the Season 6 cinematic launch trailer, and Titanfall 2, we can make quite a few educated guesses.

## We FINALLY Understand What Kind Of Game Marvel's Avengers Is

If you happen to think that Marvel's Avengers seems an awful lot like Destiny, you'd be right! The upcoming superhero game possesses several similarities to a loot shooter in how its gameplay loop works.

In the video above, Jean-Luc Seipke details Marvel's Avengers overall gameplay loop, based on what we experienced in the game's beta. This includes the game's Reassemble campaign, co-op missions, power levelling, and character progression. There's a lot to do in Marvel's Avengers.

You'll access most of the features and missions in Marvel's Avengers via the game's hub, a helicarrier known as the Chimera. From here, you can access the War Table, which lists all of your available single-player campaign missions as well as the War Zone, Drop Zone, and HARM missions that you can tackle either on your own or in a group of up to four players. 

On the Chimera, you'll also be able to access each playable character's skill tree and gear loadout, allowing you to customize your heroes. Each character has their own battle pass-like challenge card too, along with an assortment of daily and weekly challenges that you can check on while aboard the Chimera.
