Talsorian Games (https://rtalsoriangames.com)\n\nArtists in order of appearance:\nAlexander Dudar\nNeil Branquinho\nAdrian Marc\nAnselm Zielonka\nAngelina Stroganova\n\nEveryone in the world of Cyberpunk 2077 knows the name Johnny Silverhand. He's a veteran, a rockerboy and, above all, a revolutionary. In an inspired stroke of casting, he's also being portrayed by Keanu Reeves in CD Projekt Red's upcoming first person RPG. In preparation for its November release, we're going to look back at the origins and history of this key character so you'll fully understand his role when you begin your adventure in Night City.\n\nSo what even is a rockerboy? In this video, Jake explains the class, which is unique to Cyberpunk's fiction, and how Johnny embodies this role through his music and anti-corporate ideologies. These ideologies came straight from his experiences as an American soldier during the underhanded Central American Conflict. This also happens to be where he lost his arm. With a prosthetic replacement, Silverhand changed his name and started the band Samurai, which was his conduit for speaking out against the status quo. \n\nWe also get the skinny on Johnny's tragic lost love, and a hatred for the mega corp Arasaka that now drives him in a post-Samurai world. We don't know much about the role Reeves's electronic ghost will be playing in V's story, other than that it will likely be significant. We'll have to wait for the game's release for more specifics and to see how Reeves's voice acting and motion capture for the character turned out. \"Wake the f*ck up, Samurai, we have a city to burn.\"\n\n#Cyberpunk2077 #JohnnySilverhand #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87n9-lGYWRc", "date_published": "2020-08-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout Review", "description": "Fall Guys' charming presentation and approachable mechanics make it the most welcoming battle royale yet, with just a few blemishes keeping it from greatness.

That means new operators, weapons and of course- awesome moments to behold! The CoD community is already testing the strength of the new train, flooding the newly opened stadium, and picking on the returning Juggernauts. Here\u2019s a breakdown of our top 5 moments for the first week of August.\n\nOur first clip is from Reddit user CommanderKittyPwn. Juggernauts have returned to Warzone (for now) and Commander and his crew aren\u2019t welcoming them back with open arms. His entire squad is able to pin the jug in a doorway using their riot shields. Once he\u2019s pinned, the squad unloads their weapons and melee away until he\u2019s down. Next up is a clip from RilesJenkins on Reddit. After a loadout drop falls onto the blades of his helicopter, he tries to juggle it to get it to fall off. Unfortunately, this backfires and destroys his helicopter, downing him in the process.\n\nOur next clip is from GammonRod on Reddit, who tries to make a friend on the battlefield. Surprisingly, it works! The pair drive around, honking their horns and sharing loadouts. Unfortunately, Gammon\u2019s new friend accidentally uses a pit maneuver on his SUV- flipping them both around and causing Gammon to squish his new friend. Gone but never forgotten\u2026\n\nStopping the new train is impossible right? BoldWarrior14 and his friends attempt to find out. Using 4 of the biggest cargo trucks, the crew blocks the train\u2019s path in hopes to debunk this mystery. As expected, the train plows through all four trucks without even slowing down. Nice try anyway, boys! Last but not least is InFinZible from Reddit, who faces death by an RPG. In the middle of a sniper battle, an RPG comes careening towards him and his friend. Thank goodness he had a trophy system set up, because that would have been a direct hit!  \n\n- \"No Luv for the Jug\" clip by Reddit user CommanderKittyPwn\n\n- \"Careless Package\" clip by Reddit user RilesJenkins\n\n- \"4-Wheelin' Friends\" clip by Reddit user GammaRod\n\n- \"Stop That Train\" clip by Reddit user BoldWarrior14\n\n- OMGRPG clip by Reddit user InFinZible\n\n00:11 - Number 5 - No Luv For the Jug\n00:33 - Number 4 - The Care(less) Package\n00:58 - Number 3 - The 4-Wheelin' Friends\n01:34 - Number 2 - Stop That Train!\n02:21 - Number 1 - OMG RPG\n03:08 - Bonus Submission Clip", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=280QVdngAyw", "date_published": "2020-08-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends New Legend, Season 6 Details Revealed | Save State", "description": "Apex Legends' sixth season has been revealed, with the battle royale adding a brand new legend, Rampart, as well as a new weapon, cosmetic type, crafting system, and battlepass.\n\nCD Projekt Red has announced that its next Cyberpunk 2077 Night City Wire livestream will be on Monday August 10, where we'll learn more about the weapons in the game, as well as the lifepaths, and the band Refused's role in the game.\n\nFinally, Sony's State Of Play stream revealed that PSVR Support is coming to Hitman 3 when it launches early next year. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:14 - Apex Season 6 Adds A New Legend, Weapon, & More\n00:56 - More Cyberpunk 2077 News Is Coming Next Week\n01:39 - Hitman 3 Is Getting A PSVR Mode", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGx884kCDa4", "date_published": "2020-08-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends Season 6: New Character, Weapon, & Crafting Revealed", "description": "We break down the latest Apex Legends trailer, which reveals the new legend Rampart.

Whether or not we're right remains to be seen, though we'll find out pretty soon as Season 6 is scheduled to begin on August 18.\n\nSo far, Respawn has confirmed Season 6's new character is Rampart and its new weapon is the Volt SMG. The developer has also announced a new crafting system will be implemented in Season 6 and that the season's battle pass will include a brand-new collection of Holo-Spray items.\n\nThat's pretty much it, though. We don't know Rampart's abilities, how the Volt will behave in combat, how crafting will work, or what Holo-Sprays will look like. However, based on in-game clues and map changes, the Season 6 cinematic launch trailer, and Titanfall 2, we can make quite a few educated guesses.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=as1YClpQG68", "date_published": "2020-08-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "DOOM Eternal \u2013 Official DLC Teaser Part 1 | 'The Ancient Gods'", "description": "Watch the first glimpse of DOOM Eternal\u2019s first campaign expansion, then see the full trailer reveal at Opening Night Live, August 27th at 2pm ET.\n\nYour victory over Hell\u2019s armies pulled humanity back from the edge of extinction, but it came at a cost.
