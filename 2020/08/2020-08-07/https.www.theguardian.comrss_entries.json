More crucially, his eventful years in rugby administration have given him a clear insight into the sport\u2019s structural deficiencies. Hence the relevance of a document outlining exactly how the English game might be streamlined and recast by reinventing the Championship as a viable and attractive \u201cheartland\u201d competition with the country\u2019s best young players front and centre.<br /><br />The vision also incorporates pooled Championship television rights potentially worth \u00a312m a year, a player draft, university-based regional centres of excellence, more emphasis on education and skills in preparation for life after rugby, and a very different vibe, with the A League and existing Premiership academies disappearing and the landscape no longer scarred by self-interest. \u201cIf people can see past petty issues of ego and control, and focus on what it is fundamentally right for the game, this model will be welcomed on all sides,\u201d concludes Griffiths.<br /><br />Certain Premiership clubs have wasted no time dismissing that notion as wishful thinking; one prominent chairman has described it a \u201cfantasy\u201d despite the initial proposed moratorium on Championship promotion. It was always going to be a leap of the imagination to visualise every club embracing the idea of losing control of their beloved, often successful academies. Equally, though, club rugby union is a sport under financial siege. The longer Covid-19 hangs around, the greater the threat to its viability.<br /><br />Which is why, amid the natural anticipation generated by the Gallagher Premiership\u2019s impending resumption, it pays to keep an eye on the wider picture. Spare a thought, in particular, for those most vulnerable to the chill draught of Covid reality: lower league clubs with shuttered bars and silent clubhouses, experienced pros suddenly high and dry in a bleak job market and thousands of youngsters denied the life-enhancing gift of proper competitive rugby for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />The earliest possible date for rugby\u2019s return at level three and below seems likely to be November but it could be January or even later if a serious second wave of infections materialises. How do you rate a teenager who has not played in anger for a year and for whom all developmental avenues are blocked? Can you blame him or her if they start losing interest in a sport they cannot smell or touch? And if the game\u2019s roots start to wither and die, what happens then?<br /><br />At this point all eyes inevitably swivel to the Rugby Football Union, both for guidance and visionary leadership. Who would wish to swap places with Bill Sweeney, the chief executive, as he wrestles with multiple headaches and culls a third of the union\u2019s staff? Even so, the mood out in the shires is turning mutinous, with a growing perception the community game is being unduly penalised to protect the over-fattened cats at the top.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/07/how-can-rugby-prevent-a-lost-generation-amid-the-covid-crisis\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/07/how-can-rugby-prevent-a-lost-generation-amid-the-covid-crisis", "date_published": "2020-08-07 11:07:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Digested week: I had big plans for lockdown, but mostly I watch TV | John Crace", "description": "<p>A holiday in Norfolk is a chance to spend time away from politics, and for my wife to spend less time alone with me</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>When I was a teenager, the FA Cup final was always a red letter day in the football calendar. The TV coverage would start in the morning with loads of chat and clips of the teams leaving their London hotels by bus and I would be watching every minute of it. Even my Dad, who had no interest in football whatsoever, would come inside at 3pm to watch the entire match. Sometimes he even managed to stay awake for the entire 90 minutes. Yet for the past 25 years or so, I\u2019ve never bothered to watch the final on TV. Partly because Spurs have not featured since 1991, but mostly because I\u2019ve just lost interest in the competition. This year was no exception. The weather was nice and a game between Tottenham\u2019s two main rivals \u2013 Arsenal and Chelsea \u2013 seemed entirely missable. So it was only on the following day that I discovered there had been rather more riding on the match than I had thought. By winning and claiming automatic qualification, Arsenal had condemned Spurs to play at least three extra preliminary matches for the Europa League, a competition I had been rather hoping to avoid even before this new form of hell. Tottenham\u2019s possible opponents hardly read like a roll call of Europe\u2019s finest. In no particular order, they are Kesla FK from Azerbaijan, Torshavn from the Faroe Islands, Neftchi Baku also from Azerbaijan, Kaysar Kyzylorda and Ordabasy Shymkent both from Kazakhstan, Sutjeska Niksic of Montenegro, OFI Heraklion from Crete, and Lithuania\u2019s FK Riteriai. These are all games that both Spurs and I would pay money to avoid, as their only real function is to make sure the players are exhausted by November. I\u2019m just praying that further travel bans have been put in place by September and that Tottenham are forced out of the competition by the Foreign Office.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/07/digested-week-i-had-big-plans-for-lockdown-but-mostly-i-watch-tv\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/07/digested-week-i-had-big-plans-for-lockdown-but-mostly-i-watch-tv", "date_published": "2020-08-07 11:02:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Selling curries to India: Japan exports popular restaurant chain", "description": "<p>CoCo Ichibanya hopes locals will approve of its signature hot dishes as it opens near Delhi</p><p>It sounds like the culinary equivalent of coals to Newcastle.
