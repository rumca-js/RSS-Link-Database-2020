August 27 is the date the 2020 Minnesota State Fair was set to begin. That's not happening this year, but rather than mourning it, we're going to celebrate by looking back on great performances while hoping forward. To kick things off, we'll share performances at the MPR booth by three Minnesota artists: Jeremy Messersmith, Reina Del Cid and Haley. Consider watching these outdoors in the summer breeze, try conjuring the memory of pork-chop smoke, and enjoy these great performances.

3:06 Reina Del Cid, "Mice and Men" (2015)

On Friday, the Avett Brothers release their latest collection of songs, The Third Gleam.

"The interesting thing with the 'Gleam' series is that it's like songs that are made in somewhat of a quieter, more sacred space, if you will," Scott Avett told The Current's Jill Riley in a recent interview. "The record was made on its own time, before the pandemic and before the rolling out of these long-lasting social injustices that we're witnessing.

"Although," Avett continued, "in hindsight, we were — I don't know what the word is — it was somewhat surreal to realize how applicable the thing was."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Back Into The Light"
3:47 "Victory"
7:35 "Prison To Heaven"
All songs from the Avett Brothers' 2020 release, The Third Gleam, available on Loma Vista Recordings/Concord.
