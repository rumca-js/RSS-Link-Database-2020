the closest thing we'll ever come to a my strange addiction episode. Today we have Mark Nishiyama, he's been in the MLM game for 20+ years but wanted to come on the show to discuss Ponzi Schemes and warn people of HYIP investments. Things quickly unravel though when I realize Mark is still planning to invest in yet ANOTHER Ponzi Scheme.

The Spy who Loved me...

Reminiscing about Zhengdong Cheng, a professor at Texas A&M who was recently arrested for undisclosed ties to China.. I realized I had taken a course from him in college. 

Zheng faces up to a 30 year sentence for wire fraud, conspiracy and false statement

I try to unpack whether there were any clues that should've tipped me off.
