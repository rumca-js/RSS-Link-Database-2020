I invited Jaiden, Ellen and Hank to play a trivia quiz! The sort of quiz where you can get away with wrong answers... if nobody spots them. And since they couldn't be there in person, I've got a massive virtual set. Too many wrong answers, and our players will be Disconnected.

AD: White Light provided the SmartStage studio facilities and crew! You can find out more about their technology here: https://tinyurl.com/y7dxo2gz

And disguise connected up all the (virtual) moving parts! Learn more about the latest disguise xR solution: https://web.disguise.one/xrtech
