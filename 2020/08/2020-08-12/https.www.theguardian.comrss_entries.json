But rising star Finnegan Downie Dear still made it his year, blazing to victory in the Mahler Conducting Competition - and writing a groundbreaking opera</p><p>Finnegan Downie Dear is speaking with the faraway look of a man in love. Which he is: with an orchestra. At the end of June he travelled to Bavaria, climbed on to a podium, removed his face mask and conducted the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra. Several days and four rounds later, he was the <a href=\"https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/kultur-bamberg-brite-gewinnt-mahler-competition-der-bamberger-symphoniker-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-200705-99-682401\">winner</a> of the \u20ac30,000 <a href=\"https://www.bamberger-symphoniker.de/en/the-mahler-competition/the-conducting-competition-of-the-bamberg-symphony.html\">Mahler Conducting Competition</a>, which, in its first year, 2004, was awarded to Gustavo Dudamel, now the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</p><p>If the whole episode has the quality of a dream that is hardly surprising, particularly given how shattered professional music-making has been in the UK since March. In the semi-final of the contest, Downie Dear got to conduct a particular passage of Mahler\u2019s Fourth Symphony \u2013 the end of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kTXstgF20E\">third movement</a> as it slips into the fourth. It is some of the most transcendentally beautiful music ever written: the strings hover in such airy stillness that you almost forget to breathe. \u201cAs soon as I knew I\u2019d be able to do that bit with them once, I didn\u2019t give a fuck what else happened,\u201d he says, when we meet after the end of his fortnight\u2019s quarantine. \u201cBecause just to do it once is a joy. Especially in the quiet playing: to feel like you have some magical sense of what the sound means to you and you try to show that, and the musicians try to respond \u2013 that was enough. There are sounds they made at the end of the third movement I will never forget.\u201d It is indeed true love. And requited, it seems: the orchestra has already invited him back to conduct them. \u201cThat means more than any prize could,\u201d he says.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/12/finnegan-downie-dear-interview-mahler-conducting-competition\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/12/finnegan-downie-dear-interview-mahler-conducting-competition", "date_published": "2020-08-12 05:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Forecast is funny: the best comedy shows to stream this summer", "description": "<p>The Edinburgh fringe may have been cancelled but there are plenty of online gigs to enjoy featuring Dane Baptiste, Ivo Graham, Sarah Millican and more</p><p>The line between charity gigs and normal gigs has blurred under lockdown: most online comedy now is fundraising in one way or another.
