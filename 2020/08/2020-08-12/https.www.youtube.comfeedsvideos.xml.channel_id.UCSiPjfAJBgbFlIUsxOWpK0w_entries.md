LYRICS

The sun is coming up
I'm just a waterbug
On my own
The leaves are green and blue
I'm missing someone
It might be you

All I know is a little lie
All I see is a little patch of empty sky
I'll see you in the morning

The sun is coming up
I feel it warming up
My eyelids
Flickering red and white
When I open you might
Still be here

All I know is a little lie
All I see is a little patch of empty sky
I'll see you in the morning

All I know is a little lie
All I need is a little love I can't deny
I'll see you in the morning
