Norma, along with her children, could no longer afford their apartment after her husband, Jesus, was detained following an argument. They moved in with Norma’s mother-in-law — but when she came down with COVID-19, the family could no longer stay with her. So begins Norma’s intense struggle to keep her children safe, housed and fed — while also working to get Jesus released as coronavirus cases rise at the facility where he’s being held. 

Filmed across several months and directed by Emily Kassie and Ben C. Solomon, this documentary from FRONTLINE, The Marshall Project, and the Pulitzer Center is a powerful window into how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting immigrant families.
