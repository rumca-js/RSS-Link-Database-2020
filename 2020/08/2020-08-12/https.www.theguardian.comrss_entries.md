Because on Tuesday evening Tesla (one-fifth owned by Musk) announced a “stock split” that in pre-market speculation early on Wednesday drove up the already stratospheric valuation of the company by another 7%.</p><p>Yet a stock-split is merely a housekeeping arrangement. It’s when a company divides the existing shares of its stock into multiple new shares, usually because the share price has reached such high levels that even buying one share looks too pricey for small investors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/aug/12/teslas-stock-split-is-likely-to-send-the-share-price-even-higher">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 2017 the Texan became only the second player to win three majors before turning 24, but he has won nothing since<br /><br /></p><p>Last Thursday afternoon in San Francisco three men were out alone on the range at TPC Harding Park: Jordan Spieth, his caddie, Michael Greller, and his coach, Cameron McCormick. Spieth had finished his opening round of the US PGA Championship three-and-a-half hours earlier. He’d shot 73, three-over, and was eight-off the lead, tied 109th. Now he was sitting cross-legged, his arms draped over his knees, staring into the middle distance like the answers he was looking for were hiding somewhere down there at the far end of the range.</p><p>Earlier that day, the PGA Tour posted a short clip of Spieth talking about the one thing he’d like to be able to tell his younger self. “Let me think about this question for a second,” he says in the video, “the one thing about golf that I wish I knew then that I know now.” There’s a long pause, and then he comes up with his answer. “Honestly,” he said, laughing, “I wish I played with the mentality I had back then.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/aug/12/jordan-spieth-tries-and-fails-to-recover-the-brilliance-of-his-carefree-youth-golf">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Reclaim Her Name project, marking 25 years of the Women’s prize for fiction, will introduce titles including Middlemarch by Mary Ann Evans<br /></p><p>Middlemarch is to be published for the first time in almost 150 years under George Eliot’s real name, Mary Ann Evans, alongside 24 other historic works by women whose writing has only ever previously been in print under their male pseudonyms.</p><p>Evans adopted the pen name of George Eliot in the mid-19th century, in order to ensure her works were taken seriously. Middlemarch, originally published in eight parts in 1871-72, has never been released under her real name. Evans said she was “resolute in preserving my incognito, having observed that a nom de plume secures all the advantages without the disagreeables of reputation”, while her partner George Lewes said “the object of anonymity was to get the book judged on its own merits, and not prejudged as the work of a woman, or of a particular woman”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/12/george-eliot-joins-24-female-authors-making-debuts-under-their-real-names">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers eager to buy David Jewell’s gritty novel have been directed to bondage erotica by a US writer with the same name </p><p><strong>Name:</strong> David Jewell.</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 62.<br /><br /><strong>Appearance: </strong>Bald, gritty copper from the north-east of England.<br /><br /><strong>Occupation:</strong> First-time novelist and former policeman (bald, gritty etc) from the north-east of England. His book, Death Rattle, has just been released. <br /><br /><strong>Good for him. How’s it going? </strong>Pretty well. There is just one problem.<br /><br /><strong>What? </strong>Thanks to Goodreads briefly attaching a review to the site of an American author, also called David Jewell, the two have become confused in the public mind. People trying to buy the British writer’s book on Amazon were directed to works by the other David Jewell.<br /><br /><strong>Does that matter? </strong>The American Jewell produces a very particular type of book.<br /><br /><strong>Give me a clue</strong><strong>.</strong> It’s in the titles: Kiss of the Lash; My Wife, My Slave; Teach Me To Submit! ...<br /><br /><strong>OK, OK. I get it. </strong><strong>Raunchy stuff</strong><strong>. </strong>Bondage erotica is a term he might prefer.<br /><br /><strong>How does the British Jewell feel about the confusion? </strong>Heis trying to see the upside. “Maybe the other guy’s readers will order my book,” he told <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/northumberland-crime-author-suffers-embarrassing-18748186">Chronicle Live</a>. “I could build a large American readership. I’ve already had a new Twitter follower from a group called Domination Sites.”<br /><br /><strong>This sort of confusion must happen a lot</strong><strong>. </strong>Of course. Just ask <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37988515">John Lewis</a>, the bloke from Virginia who gets bombarded every Christmas by Twitter messages praising his seasonal advertising; or US oncologist <a href="https://www.washingtonian.com/2016/06/02/virginia-cancer-doctor-donald-l-trump/">Donald Trump</a>, who has been dogged by his famous name for decades. <br /><br /><strong>It could be annoying, I guess</strong><strong>. </strong>That has certainly been the case for the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4445950/Women-birthday-mixed-up.html">two Jessica Ishaks</a> who live close to each other in Sydney and, even worse, share the same birthday – 11 April, 1993. They have had each other’s bills sent to them and one was stopped from voting because of the mix up. One of them, though it is not entirely clear which one, is now considering changing her name by deed poll. <br /><br /><strong>There must </strong><strong>be a funny side, sometimes</strong><strong>. </strong>Winston Churchill managed to confuse the philosopher Isaiah Berlin with the songwriter Irving Berlin. In 1944, <a href="https://winstonchurchill.org/the-life-of-churchill/war-leader/1943-1945/winter-1944-age-69/">Irving</a> was invited to lunch at Downing Street, but Churchill thought it was Isaiah and was a little taken aback to learn that he believed his greatest contribution to the war effort had been to compose I’m Dreaming of a White Christmas. <br /><br /><strong>What’s the solution to name confusion? </strong>Discreet use of the middle initial can help. Educationist <a href="https://www.oakorchardhealth.org/staff-bios/2014/7/9/a">David L Jewell</a>, author of such page-turners as Common Terminology, Abbreviations and Symbols for Therapeutic Recreation, does not seem to get mixed up with the author of Prisoner of Lust.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/12/debut-crime-writer-steamy-new-audience-david-jewell-bondage-erotica">Continue reading...</a>

With next week’s mainly virtual Democratic convention in Milwaukee days away, the vice-presidential pick was always going to open a window of opportunity for Trump to get into the Biden henhouse and make trouble. That hasn’t happened yet – though doubtless he will try.

<p>Should it be a fruity, frothy milk, or an artificially flavoured, ice-cream-heavy concoction that’s so thick you can’t suck it through a straw? Our resident perfectionist puts the strawberry milkshake through its paces</p><p>Milkshakes have always seemed to me the height of decadence: a dessert cunningly masquerading as a refreshing drink, and that’s even without the ice-cream that most of the world seems to regard as an essential ingredient. Strawberries, with their famous affinity with all things creamy, are the perfect summery subject – sweet enough to please, sharp enough not to be cloying, and perhaps the ultimate treat when it’s too hot to cook.</p><p>For me, the word milkshake still suggests frothy flavoured milk, a bit like the <a href="https://www.pharmacytimes.com/contributor/karen-berger/2019/02/soda-fountains--their-pharmacist-inventors">early versions served in 19th-century soda fountains</a> across the pond; when I was growing up, the only ones that were so thick they made a mockery of the straw provided came from McDonald’s (an effect darkly, if <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/a-fair-shake/">inaccurately</a>, attributed to chicken fat, rather than soft-serve ice-cream). Yet it seems I’m in the minority: correspondents express puzzlement that you could even make a milkshake without it.

## Cup runneth over: 17 ways to cook mushrooms – from spiced rice to pasta with prosciutto

<p>Fungi recipes are incredibly varied and versatile. Keep it simple and serve them on toast, or push the boat out and craft a pithivier</p><p>Not everyone likes mushrooms. In fact, edible fungi come in such an extraordinary variety of tastes, textures and shapes that it is probably impossible to like all of them.</p><p>Personally, I am not tempted by mushrooms that lie at either the extremely small or extremely large end of the size scale. I accept that a very big portobello mushroom can readily replace the meat portion of a burger – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/how_to_cook_mushrooms_52022">a simple but effective recipe for that can be found here</a> – but it is not something I would do. Also, I am a little afraid of those enoki mushrooms with the long stems and tiny caps. They have the look of something that went wrong while the lights were off. What I am saying is: you can allow yourself a few irrational prejudices and still count yourself a mushroom enthusiast. I do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/12/cup-runneth-over-17-ways-to-cook-mushrooms-recipes-spiced-rice-pasta-prosciutto">Continue reading...</a>

## The new taboo: how ‘flattering’ became fashion’s ultimate F-word

<p>Every season comes with an ostensibly complimentary shorthand. But the one that has outlived them all is probably the most problematic</p><p>‘I’ve got loads of dresses that I bought because someone in the changing room told me they were flattering,” says Billie Bhatia, the fashion features editor at Stylist magazine. “In that moment, I feel lifted. My insecurities about my body are erased.” But Bhatia, 30, has been having second thoughts about the word. “Occasionally, it means a great colour that makes your skin glow, but most of the time ‘flattering’ is just a byword for ‘slimming’,” she says. “If someone delivered the same compliment, but substituted the word ‘slimming’ for ‘flattering’, would you think that was an OK way to talk to a woman? No, right? Everyone likes to hear a compliment. But ‘flattering’ is a dangerous word.”</p><p>In 2017, the perfect pair of jeans was “on-trend”. In 2018, it was “fierce”; last year it was “extra”. Right now, it is “dripping”. In fashion, every season comes with a new shorthand. But one compliment – “flattering” – has outlived them all, selling more jeans, more party dresses and more swimsuits than any other word. “Flattering” is fashion clickbait, an add-to-basket dog whistle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/aug/12/the-new-taboo-how-flattering-became-fashions-ultimate-f-word">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Like many other women, I started having to help my dad a little, then a lot, and before I knew it someone was calling me a carer</p><p>One night in early 2016, I found myself calling for an ambulance. My father had locked himself in the toilet for four hours and wasn’t responding to anyone. My brother and I listened at the door. Nothing. The person at the other end of the 999 call had a volley of questions: “Why did he choose the toilet? Does he have a weapon? Do you think he is suicidal?” I replied with don’t know, no and no. They wanted his rejection of life to be defined as an absolute, but it was far more shadowy and ambiguous.</p><p>Panicked, I called a mental health crisis helpline too, who advised me to connect with my father through the toilet door. “Speak louder, put some force into the words,” he told me, as though I was auditioning for a part. My dad did not reply. It had been hours since I had last heard his voice, fragile, fading to a whisper. My younger brother was trying his best to help. After rummaging through a toolbox, he found a screwdriver to force between door and lock. White flakes of paint flew; the door swung open; and there was my father. He was wearing his pyjamas, standing upright, his body locked into a strange, repetitive loop. His left arm would rise, jerk above his head, then his right foot would lift, and the mechanical process would begin all over again. His face was scarlet, screwed into a fist of agony.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/aug/12/caring-for-my-dad-felt-like-something-that-had-happened-to-me-not-a-choice-i-made">Continue reading...</a>

## Sisters by Daisy Johnson review – too close for comfort

<p>The darkly riveting relationship between teenage siblings is explored in a gothic tale from the Booker-shortlisted author</p><p>July and September are the teenage sisters of this eerie, absorbing novel; they are as near to twins as two girls born 10 months apart can be. As we enter their story they are heading north – or so it appears – with their mother Sheela, driving from Oxford to Yorkshire, to a broken down house “beached up on the side of the North York Moors, only just out of the sea”. This is the liminal, watery territory that Daisy Johnson has already laid claim to in her debut collection of stories, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/18/fen-by-daisy-johnson-review-impressive-first-collection-short-stories">Fen</a></em>, published in 2016; in the 2018 Booker-shortlisted <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/26/everything-under-daisy-johnson-review-man-booker-longlist">Everything Under</a></em>, she also concocted an unsettling blend of the mythical and the real, drawing on the tale of Oedipus to enact the magnetic torment of the mother-daughter bond.</p><p>The trio are fleeing some at first unspecified disaster or distress. Sheela has pulled the girls out of school and is able to find shelter thanks to the largesse of her sister-in-law Ursa, who maintains a connection with Sheela and the girls in part, it seems, out of guilt over her brother’s behaviour. Peter, the girls’ father, died when they were tiny, and abandoned the family before that: he was violent, unstable, “like a ship on fire in the night, sails alight and taking all the other boats with it”. The experience of reading <em>Sisters</em> is a kind of dance of the seven veils as the family’s past, and the tragedy that is the book’s true narrative engine, are revealed in fragmentary, frightening glimpses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/12/sisters-by-daisy-johnson-review-too-close-for-comfort">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He was conducting a ballet in Düsseldorf when lockdown struck. But rising star Finnegan Downie Dear still made it his year, blazing to victory in the Mahler Conducting Competition - and writing a groundbreaking opera</p><p>Finnegan Downie Dear is speaking with the faraway look of a man in love. Which he is: with an orchestra. At the end of June he travelled to Bavaria, climbed on to a podium, removed his face mask and conducted the Bamberg Symphony Orchestra. Several days and four rounds later, he was the <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/kultur-bamberg-brite-gewinnt-mahler-competition-der-bamberger-symphoniker-dpa.urn-newsml-dpa-com-20090101-200705-99-682401">winner</a> of the €30,000 <a href="https://www.bamberger-symphoniker.de/en/the-mahler-competition/the-conducting-competition-of-the-bamberg-symphony.html">Mahler Conducting Competition</a>, which, in its first year, 2004, was awarded to Gustavo Dudamel, now the music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.</p><p>If the whole episode has the quality of a dream that is hardly surprising, particularly given how shattered professional music-making has been in the UK since March. In the semi-final of the contest, Downie Dear got to conduct a particular passage of Mahler’s Fourth Symphony – the end of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kTXstgF20E">third movement</a> as it slips into the fourth. It is some of the most transcendentally beautiful music ever written: the strings hover in such airy stillness that you almost forget to breathe. “As soon as I knew I’d be able to do that bit with them once, I didn’t give a fuck what else happened,” he says, when we meet after the end of his fortnight’s quarantine. “Because just to do it once is a joy. Especially in the quiet playing: to feel like you have some magical sense of what the sound means to you and you try to show that, and the musicians try to respond – that was enough. There are sounds they made at the end of the third movement I will never forget.” It is indeed true love. And requited, it seems: the orchestra has already invited him back to conduct them. “That means more than any prize could,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/12/finnegan-downie-dear-interview-mahler-conducting-competition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor and comedian decided it was time to have the procedure after he and his wife had had four children. Here he writes candidly about the experience, and why it was the kindest cut<br /></p><p>I got a vasectomy a few months ago. A vasectomy is when they cut and tie off the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/ductus-deferens">vas deferens</a>, which are these little tubes in your ball sack (scrotum) so that there’s no sperm (sperm) in your jizz (semen) when you bust (ejaculate). I did this because my wife and I don’t want her to get pregnant again. It doesn’t mean we don’t want any more kids, it just means that if we did have any more, they’d have to be adopted or stolen or left to us because friends or family with young kids died in a plane crash or had their brain stems blown apart by less-lethal rounds fired at them at point-blank range while they were waiting in an 11-hour line <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-fight-to-vote">attempting to vote</a> in November.</p><p>I figured after all my wife, Leah, and her body had done for our family, the least I could do was let a doctor slice into my bag and sterilise me. Leah had taken birth control for decades, which is a giant pain in the ass and also decidedly sexist pharmacological slavery. IMAGINE a man having to remember to not only take a pill every day, but also having to deal with employer-provided private insurance prescription plans in the US which drop you or sell your plan to another company without telling you, among other crimes. And messing up once could land you with – for example – an ectopic pregnancy that isn’t diagnosed soon enough because you’re afraid to go to the doctor due to your high deductible, so you literally die and are dead, in a cemetery.
