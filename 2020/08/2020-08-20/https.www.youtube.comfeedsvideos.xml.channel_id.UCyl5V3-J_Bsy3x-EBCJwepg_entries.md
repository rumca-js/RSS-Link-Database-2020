In this episode of The Babylon Bee podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk about the week’s biggest stories like Twitter “accidentally” suspending the Babylon Bee for the web’s darkest 90 minutes, the humble Postal Service being the focus of all the nation’s fire and fury, and how students got arrested for the peaceful protest with sidewalk chalk outside a Planned Parenthood. Kristan Hawkins, President for Students For Life, talks to The Babylon Bee and silliness ensues.
