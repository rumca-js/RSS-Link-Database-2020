<p>From a car park near Heathrow to the water features of a Wirral biscuit factory, an astonishing variety of postwar living landscapes and buildings are being awarded protection. Is this a revolution?</p><p>Think of England’s listed gardens and your mind conjures up visions of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/23/capability-brown-300th-anniversary-garden-design-genius">rolling Capability Brown landscapes</a>, stately home lawns flanked by herbaceous borders and yew hedges clipped into crisp geometric formations. You probably don’t think of the ponds outside the old Jammie Dodgers factory in Moreton on the Wirral, or the car park of a 1980s business estate near Heathrow airport.</p><p>But Historic England and the Gardens Trust want you to think differently. These two unlikely sites are among a fascinating new list of 20 postwar parks, gardens and landscapes that have been added to the <a href="https://historicengland.org.uk/whats-new/news">protected national register this week</a>, in an eye-opening move that might make you look again at an innocuous bit of verge or a concrete bench.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/aug/21/jammie-dodgers-ponds-everyday-marvels-win-protection-historic-england-gardens-trust">Continue reading...</a>

The sign said simply: “The buck stops here.”</p><p>Where does the buck stop today in Britain’s government? As one of the most disastrous weeks in the life of Boris Johnson’s tragicomic government draws to a close, no one can answer with anything approaching Truman’s clarity. One thing, however, can be said. In Britain today, the buck never stops with ministers. Blame is always dumped on someone – anyone – else. As for the man at the very top, forget it.

## Joseph Gordon-Levitt: 'Playing a cop means something different now'

<p>After two years dedicated to childcare, the actor is squarely back in the zeitgeist with three films that explore race, corruption and the roots of today’s culture wars</p><p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt could be the model of a modern movie star, to the extent the description does not really fit him at all. Acting is just one of the skills in his career portfolio, alongside writing, directing, producing, running an online creative community, hosting a podcast and, occasionally, rocking out – as the guitars, keyboards and drum kit behind him attest (he plays all of them pretty well, and sings). He is in his soundproofed studio in his Los Angeles home. “This is the indulgence of my 18-year-old self,” he admits over Zoom. His hair has grown during lockdown and hangs over his face in curly strands, but the boyish, full-faced grin is the same as ever.</p><p>Coronavirus struck as Gordon-Levitt was getting back into his stride after a two-year career break. In another sign of his modernity, he took time off to spend with his two young sons, a move practically unheard of among male actors in Hollywood. To be fair, by that stage Gordon-Levitt had already notched up 30 years in show business and he has not yet turned 40. From teen stardom in the hit sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun, he graduated through choice indie roles and into mainstream fare such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/15/inception-review">Inception</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/09/lincoln-review-spielberg-day-lewis">Lincoln</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/03/500-days-of-summer-review">(500) Days </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/03/500-days-of-summer-review">of Summer</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/sep/27/looper-review#:~:text=4%20%2F%205%20stars%204%20out%20of%205%20stars.&amp;text=Rian%20Johnson%27s%20Looper%20is,and%20muscular%20sense%20of%20urgency.">Looper</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/dec/11/snowden-review-oddly-subdued-drama-oliver-stone-joseph-gordon-levitt">Snowden</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/19/the-dark-knight-rises-review">The Dark Knight Rises</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/20/joseph-gordon-levitt-playing-a-cop-means-something-different-now">Continue reading...</a>
