children\n\nIncreased testing\n\nIncreased movement among children\n\nRise in infection among the general population\n\nWhen you see a lot more infections in the general population, you're going to

years\n\nYoung children can potentially be important drivers of SARS-CoV-2 spread in the general population\n\nAs has been demonstrated with respiratory syncytial virus, children with high viral loads are more likely to transmit\n\nBehavioral habits of young children and close quarters in school and day care raise concern for SARS-CoV-2 amplification in this population\n\nThis population will be important for targeting immunization efforts as SARS-CoV-2 vaccines become available.\n\nWilliam Haseltine, (former professor at Harvard Medical School)\n\nChildren ages zero to five can be;\n\nhighly infectious to other people. It turns out they have a thousand times more virus in their nose than you need to infect, so they're very, very contagious\n\nThere's every reason to suspect that this virus, even though it can kill you, behaves pretty much like a cold virus, in terms of transmission\n\nWho drives colds? Children drive colds\n\nAnd that's true of almost all respiratory diseases, including the colds and including the colds that are caused by coronaviruses\n\nAnd this is one of those cousins\n\nIt even uses the same receptor in the nasal passages as one of the cold viruses\n\nCDC\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6932e3.htm?s_cid=mm6932e3_w\n\nHospitalization data from 14 states\n\nSince March 1, 2020\n\n576 pediatric COVID-19\u2013associated hospitalizations\n\nChildren, 8.0 per 100,000Adults, 164.5 per 100,000\n\nOne in 3 children hospitalised required ICU\n\nBrazil\n\nCases, 3, 057, 470\n\nDeaths, 101,752\n\nIndia\n\nCases, 2, 268, 675\n\nDeaths, 45, 257\n\nRussia\n\nCases, 890, 779\n\nDeaths, 15, 104\n\nSouth Africa\n\nCases, 563, 598\n\nDeaths, 10,621", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UJ2PL5ERVo", "date_published": "2020-08-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "DW Interview , Global cases and Russian vaccine", "description": "DW interviewers are always ver polite and helpful.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaO8TrDh1bQ", "date_published": "2020-08-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
