<p>Atalanta take on PSG in a Champions League quarter-final and hope to provide more succour for their Covid-19-ravaged city</p><p>For two months, the wailing of ambulances cut into Bergamo’s soul. It knew no difference between bleak days and dark, tortured nights that came to seem endless. “The constant noise, you had to kill it in some ways, it was getting in your mind,” Franz Barcella says. “The news on television looked nothing like as bad as what those noises will tell you. You had fear, but it was more than fear for yourself.”</p><p>The cruelty of what had hit Bergamo, which became the centre of Europe’s worst Covid-19 outbreak in March, was hard to reconcile. So was the spectrum of emotions when, on 10 March, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/10/valencia-atalanta-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report" title="">Atalanta beat Valencia</a> to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League. The last-16 second leg was being played behind closed doors in Spain, with the extent of the disaster now becoming clear. Boyhood supporter Alberto Savi watched at home as Josip Ilicic swept in the team’s, and his own, fourth goal of a night that should have been the stuff of unfettered fantasy. The television commentators balanced their own incredulity by reminding Bergamo’s citizens to resist any urge to convene on the streets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/11/atalanta-results-are-a-really-important-cure-covid19-bergamo-people-champions-league">Continue reading...</a>

One week after the enormous explosion that levelled much of Beirut, its rulers have rightly paid a price. The power of the street had exposed the fragility of Lebanese leaders. Impunity hadn’t won the day after all.</p><p>But what seemed like much needed relief is more likely to be the start of a familiar pattern; the same line up of ministers who quit in disgrace will now take on a caretaker role, while those who really control the country haggle over the next incarnation of a government that is likely to look very similar to the one that has just resigned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/11/if-ever-there-was-a-moment-for-change-in-lebanon-this-must-surely-be-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Meditation Rocks is a popular online wellness resource. Here, its founder discusses with a mentor how to make an income from the website</p><p>When Lucy Stone worked as a BBC radio journalist, she would often have panic attacks in the bathroom before she went on air. That was, until she started meditating. “I’d say, I’ll be right back, and I’d go and meditate for a few minutes,” she says. “After that I’d feel like I’d come back to who I was. No one knew at the time.”</p><p>It’s an approach that has served her well over the years – through a career change, a divorce and, most recently, her mum’s death – and one that she now teaches to others through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/meditationrocksofficial" rel="nofollow">Meditation Rocks</a>. “For me, meditation is about my health – if I don’t do it, I don’t feel as well,” she says. “Certainly with my mum’s death, it has helped me to put things into perspective, to get some comfort and some sleep.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/go-make-it/2020/aug/11/how-do-i-monetise-this-a-meditation-teacher-learns-how-to-build-an-online-business">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve slept with four men and have been unable to reach orgasm or get any pleasure. Now I feel as if I can’t do anything right</p><p><strong>I’m</strong><strong> 18 years old, and have been sexually active for the past two years, having slept with four men</strong><strong>. My issue is that I</strong><strong> have never felt truly pleasured in bed. It’s not that my partners have been bad </strong><strong>lovers – a couple have been truly good and doting and tried everything to help me – but I have never been able to finish or even feel any form of true pleasure out of </strong><strong>sex. </strong><strong>I don’t feel </strong><strong>numb down there, but </strong><strong>I might as well be</strong><strong>; all I feel is movement. </strong><strong>I have never even been able to </strong><strong>orgasm by myself</strong><strong>. It feels like a massive build up, but there</strong><strong> is a wall </strong><strong>where everything feels like too much and I can’t push myself over. I</strong><strong> wonder</strong><strong> if maybe it’s </strong><strong>because of my anxiety about being good? I have usually felt </strong><strong>as if I can’t do anything right or </strong><strong>well enough. But even when I am full of confidence and fully relaxed, it’s no</strong><strong> different. My self-esteem is absolutely destroyed and I don’t know what to do about being able to pleasure others and being able to feel pleasure myself. Am I broken?</strong></p><p>You are certainly not “broken”. You just haven’t yet been able to enjoy sex with a partner. This is extremely common – especially at your age. It seems to me that you are expecting a lot of yourself – that you should achieve some kind of acceptable sexual goal, a certain level of pleasure, a type of partner connection. But you don’t really seem ready to enjoy any of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/11/im-new-to-sex-dont-really-enjoy-it-am-i-broken">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At Campwell, a woodland site near Bath, lock your mobile away for an escape of lake swimming, woodworking and outdoor cooking</p><p>I was lying in bed staring up at the clouds scudding across the sky. It was morning, and probably time to get up, but watching the kaleidoscope of blue and white through a little window in the roof was strangely compelling. And, anyhow, I didn’t have anywhere to be or anything to do. Which was why I had come to Campwell, a woodland camp around six miles north-east of Bath, where the philosophy is to “discover your calm” in a wild setting.</p><p>The sense that Campwell is a special place was palpable even before we arrived – roads narrowed and trees encroached until we came to a wooden sign and turned onto an unpaved track, bumping along until it petered out altogether. We parked the car and carried our stuff along an uneven footpath deeper into the woods. I was with my 10-year-old son, who started hopping about with excitement as soon as he spotted the outdoor kitchen. Within seconds of clocking the wood-fired rocket stoves, he had the sausages out of the coolbox and was grabbing handfuls of kindling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/aug/11/off-grid-calm-camping-trip-campwell-woodland-bath-wiltshire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Something has gone badly wrong with the way we keep pets. Our casual cruelties are a symptom of our unhealthy relationship with other species. By Esther Woolfson</p><p>I must have been about four when we drove to buy a dog. The day is now only a haze of Sunday afternoon impressions of rain and green, of the muddy track somewhere in the Stirlingshire countryside, a room, a log fire, and the two chosen puppies who would be the confidants of my growing up. The black dog died when I was in my early teens, and the brown one, the last dog I knew well, shortly before I left school. Our buying them must have been part of the growing tendency for post-second world war pet-keeping, which had been increasing since Victorian times, and was about to expand into the vast pet trade of today.</p><p>But what makes us choose one creature over another? Many studies have evaluated the importance of a species’ appearance in determining its popularity, commercial potential or conservation status. The conclusions are dismaying: “An animal’s attractiveness substantially increases support for its protection,” one study says, while another concludes: “A few charismatic and cute species … tend to receive most of the conservation funds and policy attention.” Creatures are ranked – “the 20 most charismatic species” – or described as “powerful commercial icons” or “the world’s cutest animals”. Even the birds in our gardens are subject to our caprices. The results of <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0141505" title="">a study</a> on the “likeability” of garden birds show that we like songbirds (even though we may not be able to define correctly what a songbird is), preferring robins and blackbirds to corvids, gulls, pigeons and starlings. We consider the former attractive but the latter argumentative, competitive and noisy – all necessary, natural behaviours of wild birds. “Charismatic”, “iconic”, “cute” – in a time of devastating and irreversible <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/dec/14/a-different-dimension-of-loss-great-insect-die-off-sixth-extinction" title="">species loss</a>, can these really be the measures of our love?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/11/pets-how-we-hurt-the-animals-we-cherish">Continue reading...</a>

## Richie Mawson was a beloved dad and Liverpool fan. Did a late lockdown cost him his life?

<p>On the day the WHO declared a pandemic, 52,000 fans – including 3,000 from Spain – piled into Anfield to watch the Reds play Atlético. Weeks later, the city was a Covid-19 hotspot.
