Hello and Welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news.

This week I cover a range of topics from the Valve Index coming back in stock to HTC pulling the plug on it's cheapest headset in the lineup the HTC Vive Cosmos Play. This means nothing great for HTC in the short term for consumer VR. I also will cover Hitman VR and a high school in Poland using Half Life alyx for VR lessons. Strap in for another hot week of VR news.
