Fisher, aka Zero, is a new Operator joining the roster for the new season, Operation Shadow Legacy. Tony goes over the new Attacker's abilities and gadgets in the video above.\n\nThere's more than a new season to check out in Rainbow Six Siege.

Everything from bizarre player and gun textures, to the map barely loading in at all. Not to mention the rampant hackers with aimbots and clipping abilities. Still, the Warzone community carries on and trudges through another week before any hotfixes are released. In this video Richie goes over 5 glitchy moments of the week.\n\nIn our first clip from Krushed Muffins, we see what Verdansk looks like with about 50% of the map loaded in. Instead of getting booted, Muffinz is able to not only proceed, but land on the train with his squad- and even pick up a weapon. Unfortunately the gun he finds has a weird glitched scope that doesn\u2019t allow him to see who or what he\u2019s shooting at. Next up is a clip from Reddit user leggoMUHeggo36. He finds an enemy player and takes a shot using his RPG. While it looks like he made contact, the enemy in question suddenly disappears! Leggo doesn\u2019t get awarded a kill, and the enemy is never seen again.\n\nAt number 3, we have iComshot\u2019s clip of a strange new...operator? After being hunted down, iComshot sees his opponent face to face and discovers a graphical mess of a glitch. This is a common glitch for players and weapons, and normally makes the game unplayable, but somehow, this enemy still came out on top. Number 2 comes to us from Urbanpod on Reddit. After deploying from the Warzone plane, Urban lands without a weapon. Even stranger is when he suddenly gets sent to the gulag for seemingly no reason at all! Our final spot on the list goes to Heade from Youtube. After facing off against a hacking team, Heade\u2019s squad wins by the skin of their teeth with a hail Mary C4 explosive. The team takes the victory and the lobby afterwards is excited to say the least.\n\n\n-The Upside Down via Reddit: KrushedMuffinz  \n\n- The Ghostin' Ghost via Reddit: leggoMUHeggo36\n\n- New Operator via Reddit: iComshot\n\n- Born to Lose via Reddit: UrbanPod\n\n- The Hack Clap Back via YouTube: Heade", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MonoNYv9-Gc", "date_published": "2020-08-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Rise Of Arasaka, The Corporation That Wants To Rule The World | Cyberpunk 2077 Lore", "description": "Select images courtesy of R.

The Japanese corporation has played a pivotal part in some of the most important stories in the world of Cyberpunk, and CD Projekt Red's game is no exception. In fact the game is looking like it's going to tackle a few characters and plotlines the pen-and-paper game has been building for decades.\n\nIn this video you'll learn everything you need to know about Arasaka. What started as a simple manufacturing company became a far more nefarious entity under the leadership of Saburo Arasaka, who secretly plots for world domination. They've shaped the world of Cyberpunk in many ways, including their role in the devastating Fourth Corporate War and detonation of a nuclear device in Night City.\n\nWe have several more videos that deep dive into the locations and legends of the world of Cyberpunk, including a history of Night City and the rise and disappearance of Rockerboy Johnny Silverhand.
