CDC

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html

Laboratory tests positive for SARS-CoV-2 have continued to decrease nationally since mid-July

Decreased or remained the same

Weekly hospitalization rates and mortality attributed to COVID-19 declined during week 32 (ending 8th August)

Mortality attributed to COVID-19 remains above the epidemic threshold.

CDC, Infections in children
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/pediatric-hcp.html

Number and rate of cases, steadily increasing from March to July 2020

True incidence not known

As of 3rd August
0 – 17 years
22% of the US population
7.3% of all cases 
Hospitalization rates in children, significantly lower

It is unclear
If children are as susceptible to infection compared with adults
If they can transmit the virus as effectively as adults
Children likely have the same or higher viral loads
Children can spread the virus effectively in households and camp settings
Community mitigation measures and school closures, therefore low transmission so far

FDA
Yale School of Public Health cheaper saliva test
$2 reagents, $10
Trial on National Basketball Association players
Fifth saliva test approved by the FDA

South Africa
Cyril Ramaphosa, reached the peak of Covid-19 infections,
Sweeping removal of lockdown restrictions on the economy
