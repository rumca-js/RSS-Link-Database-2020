<p>British holidaymakers returning from France express a mix of anger, resignation and confusion at 14-day quarantine order </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Weary and bedraggled, the first set of quarantiners from France began arriving at Gatwick airport at 10.20am today, missing the UK deadline to get back by a handful of hours. A mix of fury, resignation and confusion descended on the north terminal as five flights from the south of France arrived within an hour.</p><p>“How does it make sense?” asked Reda, who had spent two weeks in Bordeaux with his wife Elodie and their five-year-old daughter, Sara. “Either you allow people proper time to stagger getting back or you say quarantine is effective immediately.

It is particularly sad for people who have bought tickets months in advance, perhaps for just one day, perhaps with an eleven year old at their first cricket match. There really is no justification for this – a half price refund if less than 25 overs are bowled is an insult. My solution is as follows: All test match tickets are now paid for electronically – at least I assume this to be tha case. There should be an automatic pro rata refund for overs not bowled in any given day. For example a ticket costing £90, would include an automatic electronic refund of £6 if only 84 overs are bowled. This solution would also address slow over rates.”</p><p>Creative! On rates, I always find it fascinating how easily First Class teams get their overs in. I was calling Middlesex v Hampshire at Radlett last week and it was genuinely hot on each of the four days. Yet, each afternoon, both teams met their allocation of overs inside the permitted period of time. Funny that. Speaking of county cricket, we do have some play around the country. Follow it with Tanya. </p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/aug/15/county-cricket-warwicks-v-somerset-lancs-v-notts-and-more-live">County cricket: Warwicks v Somerset, Lancs v Notts and more – live!</a> </p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-08-15T10:51:15.571Z">11.51am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p><strong>“Hi Adam.” David Wall, good morning.</strong> “Didn’t Stuart Broad discuss (and ruthlessly dismiss as though it was an out-of-form batter) your idea about switching to a (suitably aged) pink ball when it gets too dark to use the red one? His point was that it would be enormously unfair on the batting side at the point of the change because the two balls can behave so differently. I’m not sure I find that such a problem, after all, teams are always affected by changes in conditions (e.g. batting early or late in the day in the sub-continent when the dew forms on the pitch very quickly and heavily, changes in cloud cover, etc). But perhaps more of a worry is you might get days, and matches, where the light changes so often that you’ve forever having to switch between the red and pink ball, perhaps as often as every 5 overs. It would become farcical.”</p><p>He might’ve, I didn’t see that. And he’s right about it being much tougher. But then again, isn’t this the entire argument against day-night Test cricket in a nutshell, that it is tougher for batsmen under lights? Thankfully, I think anyway, we moved beyond that in the space of the first 12 months or so. Much the same way that there’s an acceptance that bowling in Australia can be hellish for seamers, right? And on point two, once the ball is changed to pink, that would need to be it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/aug/15/england-v-pakistan-second-test-day-three-live">Continue reading...</a>

## From 'alert' to 'zoom': Steven Poole's lexicon of lockdown

<p>From ‘Covid-secure’ offices to healthcare ‘heroes’ bracing for a new ‘wave’, the language around coronavirus is infected with political rhetoric</p><p>The word “alert” comes from the Italian “all’erta”, literally “at a high place”, describing a military watch or guard duty. The UK government’s advice to “stay alert” in order to “control the virus” therefore implied that it would be easier to spot an invisible microbe if one were standing on a hill. Perhaps the underlying motivation for this much-ridiculed slogan was that it set the rhetorical scene for future spikes in deaths to be blamed on the people themselves. Did you die of Covid-19? Too bad: you weren’t alert enough.

<p>Your pick of places to refuel and stretch legs near motorway junctions ranges from pubs and chippies to waffle delights and a llama cafe</p><p>We discovered <strong>Penllergare Valley Woods</strong> off junction 47 of the M4, en route to Tenby. What a delightful find – its on-site cafe has ample parking, delicious snacks, cheerful staff and sparkling clean toilets. As we sampled our treats on the terrace overlooking an amazing garden, the resident robin accompanied us and shared crumbs. Later, we took a leisurely walk around the woods, lake and to the waterfall, chatting to the volunteers and discovering the place’s history.

## Pull the other one: is it time for canned laughter to return to TV?

<p>An artificial laugh track hasn’t been used for decades, but with Covid making studio audiences impossible it could be a useful tool</p><p>During the disorientating early days of lockdown, a horrible realisation dawned. Despite the impossibility of either a studio audience being present or the panellists all being in the same room, the BBC was going to persevere with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/have-i-got-news-for-you">Have I Got News </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/have-i-got-news-for-you">for You?</a>. Ian Hislop, Paul Merton and co would ignore the deathly two seconds of silence during which perfectly presentable quips plunged into the vast, empty chasm of an unstable Zoom connection and press on with their jaunty, topical comedy. This turned out to be toe-curlingly awkward – a graphic illustration of how intrinsic audiences were to the success of certain shows.</p><p>And yet, as suboptimal as the situation was, really HIGNFY had no choice but to carry on. What else was there? Were the Friday schedules to be filled with yet more out-of-date repeats of Have I Got More News for You? Surely not. Also, weren’t we trying to get our heads round one of the most profound crises of our lifetimes? How were we supposed to process the situation without topical humour? As with many of the dilemmas posed by the Covid-19 pandemic, it was lose-lose. But was a solution staring us in the face all along?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/15/pull-the-other-one-is-it-time-for-canned-laughter-to-return-to-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic has shut down concert tours – and with them go thousands of jobs in sound, lighting, catering and more. As the industry lobbies the government, road crews tell their stories</p><p>Edd Sedgwick is a sound engineer and tour manager who normally works for the Vaccines, but with that group having long planned to take 2020 off, he was preparing to go on the road with Radiohead’s Ed O’Brien. Then, as the coronavirus crisis worsened, he got a call: “Put everything on hold for the rest of the year.” Sedgwick’s life emptied out. “The weirdest thing is knowing every day by its date or the day of the week – so you call a day ‘Monday’ instead of ‘Barcelona’ or ‘Milan’.”</p><p>You can apply Sedgwick’s experience across the live music industry: thousands of workers suddenly learned their working year had ended in March. Tre Stead, for example, is Frank Turner’s tour manager. She was in the last week of Turner’s European tour when the world began to fall apart. They plugged on until Donald Trump intervened, with three shows left. “We had three Americans on the crew, and then Trump did his travel ban.” Faced with the prospect of being stranded in Europe indefinitely, the Americans – with Turner’s blessing – flew home. “And that’s when Frank decided it was the end.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/15/the-terrible-plight-of-music-event-staff-coronavirus-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

With the sun glaring through my window and the outside calling my name, a hot kitchen is the last thing on my mind.

<p>We should be watching movies that have nothing to do with the current depressing situation</p><p>Exciting news, everyone: this winter will be terrible! This is palpably and collectively beginning to sink in, with conversations transitioning from, “It seems like we’ve flattened the curve now, right?” to “Oh, the apocalypse is coming. Well, something to put in the diary at last, I guess.” In case anyone was daring to nurture a flicker of optimism, a recent <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/if-you-think-this-is-bad-just-wait-for-winter-3nh9tbx96" title="">article</a> by the Spectator’s political editor, James Forsyth, dampened that spark: “This winter the government could be dealing with flu, Covid-19, flooding, mass unemployment and all the issues arising from the end of the Brexit transition period. The cabinet is assessing how ready the state is to handle multiple crises at once.” Haha – Brexit! Oh my God, remember that? Brexit feels like the annoying boyfriend you’d forgotten about because your house burned down. And as you clear the ashes from what was your life, you realise he’s still there, holding a boombox.</p><p>I’m going to take a casual punt here and say the state will probably be not that ready to deal with this incoming clusterpocalypse, judging by the past and current state of affairs. But we can be more prepared than we were for lockdown which, I would wager, took most of us by surprise. Not all of us, of course: my father was sending me emails about the coronavirus from late January, which I merrily ignored. For many of us who grew up in the 1990s – an era so comparatively drama-free it birthed a genre of films in which the protagonists had to <em>make up</em> fictional villains (Fight Club, The Game) because even Hollywood admitted there weren’t really any threats any more – it took a while to realise how bad things were. And now, they are going to get worse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/15/clusterpocalyse-heading-our-way-stock-up-on-good-times">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Famous for writing about isolation, the author of My Year of Rest and Relaxation talks about her new novel, chronic pain and growing up as the child of migrants in America</p><p>“It is just kind of a coincidence, obviously,” Ottessa Moshfegh says of the importance of isolation in her fiction, from her home in Pasadena, California. “But yeah, it has been a major theme in my life.” She was due to be in the UK this summer as part of a publicity tour for her third novel, <em>Death in </em><em>Her Hands</em>, but she had an odd sense “that something was going to get fucked up”. Clearly, she didn’t foresee a global pandemic, but her 2018 cult novel <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/11/my-year-rest-relaxation-ottessa-moshfegh-review">My Year of Rest and Relaxation</a></em>, in which her unnamed narrator holes up in her New York apartment, has made her the unofficial laureate of lockdown. “I guess it makes me glad that people are having a place to put their isolated misery,” she says of the novel’s resurgence in recent months.</p><p>Routinely hailed as one of the most <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/ottessa-moshfeghs-painful-funny-novel-of-a-young-womans-chemical-hibernation">exciting young American authors</a> working today, she has been compared to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/19/flannery-o-connor-wise-blood"> Flannery O’Connor</a>, Shirley Jackson and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/19/charles-bukowski-san-pedro-plans-to-honor-star-writer-after-tourist-demand">Charles Bukowski (</a>one of her heroes). Her characters are a miserable ensemble of drunks and dropouts, misfits and murderers, pervs and pill-heads – all loners. And she has created an inimitable band of angry, sometimes amoral, often unpleasant and always unreliable narrators, who challenge our assumptions about femininity in uncomfortable ways. Her work takes dirty realism and makes it filthier. But it is is also beautiful: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wd7b3m/eileen-author-ottessa-moshfegh-on-phoniness-power-and-aligning-yourself-with-rich-white-people-1120">“like seeing Kate Moss take a shit”</a>, as she memorably described her writing; the depravity of her material matched by the purity and precision of her prose (a sort of American Edward St Aubyn, minus the aristos). Just don’t call her a millennial writer, “even though I am millennial”, says the author, who turns 40 next year. “There’s nothing flattering at all about the description right now.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/15/ottessa-moshfegh-americans-are-really-good-storytellers-and-really-good-liars">Continue reading...</a>

Well, almost nothing. Whether Ronnie O’Sullivan or Kyren Wilson is crowned champion on Sunday evening, they will have won a tournament like no other in its 93-year history – especially after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/14/snooker-world-championship-semi-finals-osullivan-selby-mcgill-wilson">Friday’s remarkable pair of deciding-frame thrillers</a>.

<p>Forget the tea ceremonies and geishas. This is a vivid examination of the life of an ordinary if much-married woman</p><p>In 1839 a priest’s daughter called Tsuneno ran away from her village in Echigo, otherwise known as the Snow Country of north-central Japan. Her destination was Edo, the shogun’s city, which she had longed to see from the moment she first heard of its existence. The journey took two weeks and involved a treacherous mountain trek, but to Tsuneno it was worth it. Her village home was not only on ice from equinox to equinox, but its customs and expectations seemed frozen too. The shogunate, an ancient feudal system of governance, might be on its last legs but Edo still meant warmth and sizzle and the kind of social melt that allowed for fresh starts.</p><p>Tsuneno, though, was no one’s idea of a lovely young heroine, nor did she, as you might expect from the slackly orientalist cover design and title of Amy Stanley’s book, end up as a tip-top geisha with a sideline in erotic yet subversively feminist poetry. She was, in fact, a much-married middle-aged woman with such a bad temper that, on the occasion of her fourth marriage, her eldest brother Giyu felt obliged to warn the groom: “As you probably know, she’s a very selfish person, so please return her to us if things don’t go well.” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/15/stranger-in-the-shoguns-city-by-amy-stanley-review-a-womans-life-in-19th-century-japan">Continue reading...</a>
