It is particularly sad for people who have bought tickets months in advance, perhaps for just one day, perhaps with an eleven year old at their first cricket match. There really is no justification for this \u2013 a half price refund if less than 25 overs are bowled is an insult. My solution is as follows: All test match tickets are now paid for electronically \u2013 at least I assume this to be tha case. There should be an automatic pro rata refund for overs not bowled in any given day. For example a ticket costing \u00a390, would include an automatic electronic refund of \u00a36 if only 84 overs are bowled. This solution would also address slow over rates.\u201d</p><p>Creative! On rates, I always find it fascinating how easily First Class teams get their overs in. I was calling Middlesex v Hampshire at Radlett last week and it was genuinely hot on each of the four days. Yet, each afternoon, both teams met their allocation of overs inside the permitted period of time. Funny that. Speaking of county cricket, we do have some play around the country.

His point was that it would be enormously unfair on the batting side at the point of the change because the two balls can behave so differently. I\u2019m not sure I find that such a problem, after all, teams are always affected by changes in conditions (e.g. batting early or late in the day in the sub-continent when the dew forms on the pitch very quickly and heavily, changes in cloud cover, etc). But perhaps more of a worry is you might get days, and matches, where the light changes so often that you\u2019ve forever having to switch between the red and pink ball, perhaps as often as every 5 overs. It would become farcical.\u201d</p><p>He might\u2019ve, I didn\u2019t see that. And he\u2019s right about it being much tougher. But then again, isn\u2019t this the entire argument against day-night Test cricket in a nutshell, that it is tougher for batsmen under lights? Thankfully, I think anyway, we moved beyond that in the space of the first 12 months or so. Much the same way that there\u2019s an acceptance that bowling in Australia can be hellish for seamers, right? And on point two, once the ball is changed to pink, that would need to be it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/aug/15/england-v-pakistan-second-test-day-three-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/aug/15/england-v-pakistan-second-test-day-three-live", "date_published": "2020-08-15 11:01:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus live news: theatres, casinos and bowling alleys reopen in England as South Korea reports a spike in cases", "description": "<p>Australian death toll stands at 379; France removed from UK travel corridor; Greece and Croatia impose midnight curfew on bars and restaurants </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/14/france-uk-quarantine-measures-netherlands\">France could add British visitors to quarantine list after UK measures</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/13/netherlands-and-malta-set-added-england-quarantine-list-coronavirus\">UK adds France to Covid-19 14-day quarantine list</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/14/spain-coronavirus-new-cases\">\u2018Critical moment\u2019: Spain sees cases rise again</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/aug/14/us-coronavirus-covid-death-toll-cdc-forecast-schools-reopen\">US coronavirus death toll \u2018to hit 200,000 by Labor Day\u2019</a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-08-15T10:42:48.253Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>Public health experts, researchers and manufacturers say the coming flu season could bring a twin respiratory disease outbreak in the US, just as autumn and winter are expected to exacerbate the spread of Covid-19.</p><p>At the same time, researchers said the strategies currently used to prevent coronavirus transmission \u2013 namely, hand-washing, mask-wearing and physical distancing \u2013 could also help lessen flu outbreaks, if Americans are willing to practice them.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/15/covid-19-flu-season-us-influenza-vaccine\">Flu and Covid: winter could bring 'double-barrel' outbreak to US, experts say</a> </p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-08-15T10:41:38.261Z\">11.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/15/its-the-worst-ive-ever-seen-londons-west-end-struggles-to-bounce-back-covid-19\">'It's the worst I've ever seen': London\u2019s West End struggles to bounce back</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/aug/15/coronavirus-live-news-victoria-in-australia-adds-303-cases-as-restrictions-tighten-in-europe\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/aug/15/coronavirus-live-news-victoria-in-australia-adds-303-cases-as-restrictions-tighten-in-europe", "date_published": "2020-08-15 10:47:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Liam Charles' recipe for honey-cinnamon baked peaches with thyme mascarpone", "description": "<p>Not many recipes pack as much flavour punch for so few ingredients as this herby, creamy, grilled dessert</p><p>I don\u2019t eat peaches often, but when I do, oh my \u2026 Their sweet, fleshy fruit is so versatile, and pairs well with lots of ingredients \u2013 sweet, savoury, spicy and herbaceous.
