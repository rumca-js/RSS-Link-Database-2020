Deaths, 295, 011 by December 1

Meaning 134, 309 deaths to come

Assuming some lockdowns as death rates rise

Starting today, if 95% of the people in the US were to wear masks when leaving home

228,271 deaths by December 1

Saving 66, 740 lives

Dr. Christopher Murray

People’s inconsistent use of those measures is a serious problem

We’re seeing a rollercoaster in the United States

Fewer transmissions of the virus in Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas

But deaths will continue to rise for the next week or two

Reasons for recent drop in infections

Local mandates for mask use

Bar and restaurant closures

More responsible behaviour by the public

The public’s behaviour had a direct correlation to the transmission of the virus and, in turn, the numbers of deaths

Areas with increases in transmission

Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Virginia
  
These states may experience increasing cases for several weeks and then may see a response toward more responsible behaviour

Mask wearing

Mandates with no penalties, 8%

Mandates with penalties, 15%

Overall 5% increase since mid-July

Lockdowns when the daily death rate reaches 8 per million

August – Arizona, Florida, Mississippi, and South Carolina 

September – Georgia and Texas  

October – Colorado, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Nevada, North Carolina, and Oregon.   

November – Alabama, Arkansas, California, Iowa, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, 

Washington, and Wisconsin. 

If mask use is increased to 95%, the re-impositions could be delayed 6 to 8 weeks on average

Lot of current rural spread with poor health care, e. g. Bihar

Indian government spends $63 per person on healthcare

China spent $398 (WHO, 2016)

176 million people still live on less than $2 a day.

Ignored and struggling infrastructure could collapse

Daily wage earners and contract workers form almost 80% of the workforce.
