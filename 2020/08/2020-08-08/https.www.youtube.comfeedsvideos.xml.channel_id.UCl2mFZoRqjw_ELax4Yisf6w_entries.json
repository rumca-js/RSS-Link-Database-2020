Hero Senators just announced the bill titled, \"The Critical Medical Infrastructure Right-to-Repair Act of 2020\".(1) To date, no relief for Nebraska Farmers in their legislative quest via the Unicameral to obtain repair software for their farm tractors.  \n\nToday, ONLY approved Ag Dealerships get access to repair & diagnostic software for Tractors...\n\nThe Farmers & Ranchers spoke via their Nebraska Farm Bureau Delegates in 2016 (100%) & 2019 (176-1) \"In Favor\" of Right-to-Repair.(2)  The Nebraska Farmers Union is also 100% on board. They want help from their State Senators to fix their tractors...that's a fact.  \n\nHats off to the talented Lobbyists (AEM & EDA) who obviously do a great job winning vs this overwhelming majority of your constituent-Farmers & Ranchers who are left holding a worsening farm-lot filling up of ag equipment vulnerable to more expensive fixes each year.  \n\nThis Monopoly on Ag Repair has got to stop.  Please forward the bill, \"Farm Equipment Repair Act\" to the drafting Committee as an Ag Committee Priority Bill.(3)   \n\n(1)    https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Critical%20Medical%20Infrastructure%20Right%20to%20Repair%20Act%20of%202020%20Bill%20Text.pdf\n\n(2)    https://uspirg.org/blogs/blog/usp/nebraska-farmers-vote-overwhelmingly-right-repair\n\n(3)    ref attached pdf\n\n\nLastly, a 'Compromise Agreement'(MOU) between the NEFB/NFU & the Ag Equipment Industry is flat out worthless without access to 'Payload Files'...or software patches.  We need exactly the same Deal as the Dealers get.  Any compromise here will result in a continued 100% Monopoly on Repair & Independent Farm Mechanics will be left out.  \n\nAll we want is what the Automobile Industry already has....repair software....", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPgSG41Jk7M", "date_published": "2020-08-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
