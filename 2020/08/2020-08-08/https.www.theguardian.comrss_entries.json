Different types of mask offer different levels of protection. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against Covid-19 infection, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. So even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested such masks should be reserved for health workers or those at particularly high risk.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/08/what-kind-of-face-mask-best-protects-against-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/08/what-kind-of-face-mask-best-protects-against-coronavirus", "date_published": "2020-08-08 11:43:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Surrey fire service declares major incident after 100 homes evacuated", "description": "<p>Residents describe wildfire that began on Chobham Common and spread to golf course </p><p>Surrey fire and rescue service has declared a major incident as crews continue to battle a 40-hectare wildfire that has reportedly led to as many as 100 homes being evacuated as a precaution.</p><p>The blaze started in Chobham Common <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/07/fire-crews-battle-huge-wall-of-flames-blaze-in-surrey\">on Friday</a> as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/06/beachgoers-warned-to-stay-safe-as-uk-braces-for-potential-heatwave\">temperatures in the south-east soared</a> and spread to Wentworth golf course, halting play in the Rose Ladies Series Grand Final tournament. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/08/surrey-fire-service-major-incident-100-homes-evacuated-chobham-common\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/08/surrey-fire-service-major-incident-100-homes-evacuated-chobham-common", "date_published": "2020-08-08 11:42:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Poem of the month: How to Do Absolutely Nothing by Barbara Kingsolver", "description": "<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/08/the-best-recent-poetry-review-roundup\">The best recent poetry \u2013 review roundup </a></li></ul><p>Rent a house near the beach, or a cabin<br />but: Do not take your walking shoes.<br />Don\u2019t take any clothes you\u2019d wear<br />anyplace anyone would see you.<br />Don\u2019t take your rechargeables.<br />Take Scrabble if you have to,<br />but not a dictionary and no<br />pencils for keeping score.<br />Don\u2019t take a cookbook<br />or anything to cook.<br />A fishing pole, ok<br />but not the line,<br />hook, sinker,<br />leave it all.<br />Find out<br />what\u2019s<br />left.</p><p>\u2022 <em>How to Fly (In Ten Thousand Easy Lessons) by Barbara Kingsolver is published by Faber (\u00a314.99).
