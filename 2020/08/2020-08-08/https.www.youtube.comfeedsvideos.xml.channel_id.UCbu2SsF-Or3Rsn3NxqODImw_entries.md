Everyone in the world of Cyberpunk 2077 knows the name Johnny Silverhand. He's a veteran, a rockerboy and, above all, a revolutionary. In an inspired stroke of casting, he's also being portrayed by Keanu Reeves in CD Projekt Red's upcoming first person RPG. In preparation for its November release, we're going to look back at the origins and history of this key character so you'll fully understand his role when you begin your adventure in Night City.

So what even is a rockerboy? In this video, Jake explains the class, which is unique to Cyberpunk's fiction, and how Johnny embodies this role through his music and anti-corporate ideologies. These ideologies came straight from his experiences as an American soldier during the underhanded Central American Conflict. This also happens to be where he lost his arm. With a prosthetic replacement, Silverhand changed his name and started the band Samurai, which was his conduit for speaking out against the status quo. 

We also get the skinny on Johnny's tragic lost love, and a hatred for the mega corp Arasaka that now drives him in a post-Samurai world. We don't know much about the role Reeves's electronic ghost will be playing in V's story, other than that it will likely be significant. We'll have to wait for the game's release for more specifics and to see how Reeves's voice acting and motion capture for the character turned out. "Wake the f*ck up, Samurai, we have a city to burn."

Call of Duty season 5 is finally here! That means new operators, weapons and of course- awesome moments to behold! The CoD community is already testing the strength of the new train, flooding the newly opened stadium, and picking on the returning Juggernauts. Here’s a breakdown of our top 5 moments for the first week of August.

Our first clip is from Reddit user CommanderKittyPwn. Juggernauts have returned to Warzone (for now) and Commander and his crew aren’t welcoming them back with open arms. His entire squad is able to pin the jug in a doorway using their riot shields. Once he’s pinned, the squad unloads their weapons and melee away until he’s down. Next up is a clip from RilesJenkins on Reddit. After a loadout drop falls onto the blades of his helicopter, he tries to juggle it to get it to fall off. Unfortunately, this backfires and destroys his helicopter, downing him in the process.

Our next clip is from GammonRod on Reddit, who tries to make a friend on the battlefield. Surprisingly, it works! The pair drive around, honking their horns and sharing loadouts. Unfortunately, Gammon’s new friend accidentally uses a pit maneuver on his SUV- flipping them both around and causing Gammon to squish his new friend. Gone but never forgotten…

Stopping the new train is impossible right? BoldWarrior14 and his friends attempt to find out. Using 4 of the biggest cargo trucks, the crew blocks the train’s path in hopes to debunk this mystery. As expected, the train plows through all four trucks without even slowing down. Nice try anyway, boys! Last but not least is InFinZible from Reddit, who faces death by an RPG. In the middle of a sniper battle, an RPG comes careening towards him and his friend. Thank goodness he had a trophy system set up, because that would have been a direct hit!
