<p>(Cadillac)<br />The late trumpeter and friends simply dazzle in this immaculate, feel-good set</p><p>A welcome rediscovery from 1975, with a promisingly cheerful title. Barbados-born <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/26/harry-beckett-obituary">Harry Beckett</a> (1935-2010) had one of the most beautiful trumpet tones I’ve ever heard. It was firm, but soft at the edges, with a chuckle lurking somewhere inside. <em><a href="https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/harry-beckett/joy-unlimited">Joy Unlimited</a></em> isn’t typical of its time, or of anything except itself. All six tracks are Beckett compositions, tuneful, spirited and attractively arranged. His own solo playing is quite astonishing.</p><p>In the first piece he takes off at terrifying speed, hitting some high notes that may interest your dog. This is to make sure you’re paying attention. After this, the gorgeous sound, on both trumpet and flugelhorn, takes over, notably in Rings Within Rings. There’s one brief but enchanting slow piece – a duet with guitarist Ray Russell, Changes Are Still Happening – and a wonderfully rolling Caribbean-flavoured number, Glowing, featuring Brian Miller on keyboards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/08/harry-beckett-joy-unlimited-review-lost-classic-from-1975">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Headaches are telling you something about how your brain works with your body, influencing your behaviour and feelings</p><p>We need pain. It seems contradictory to say it, particularly now that we have so many ways of dealing with it and switching it off. Pain not only tells us something is wrong, it also protects us. If you slam the car door on your hand, it’s going to hurt. You will have damaged the soft tissue; all the muscles and ligaments that help you move your fingers. It will no doubt swell up to twice its size. This inflammation is part of the healing process. Your hand feels hot and looks red because of all the extra blood flow. All these inflammatory agents that are acting to heal you are stimulating the pain receptors in your hand, the ones in your skin and your muscles. Your head is not so different except, crucially, the underlying cause can be much more subtle and varied.</p><p>As a neuroscientist who writes about headaches, it is somewhat ironic to admit that I suffer from them still. Two recent headaches stand out. The first happened when I couldn’t find my glasses. I’m astigmatic so I see the world on a bit of a slant because my left eyeball is shaped like a rugby ball instead of a football. Just looking around can be effortful. Plus, the search made me late for everything that day which was unpleasant. By the time I got home, my head felt like it was in the grip of giant hands and they had begun to squeeze hard. All I wanted for dinner was a paracetamol sandwich.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/08/listen-to-your-migraine-to-help-you-feel-better-and-to-learn-about-yourself">Continue reading...</a>

## Papicha review – female friendship and resistance in 90s Algeria

<p>Fashion is a form of protest in this shimmering semi-autobiographical tale following a design student and friends during the country’s civil war</p><p>For Nedjma (Lyna Khoudri, magnetic), fashion is political. A design student in 1990s Algiers, she clings to what she considers to be her rights – the choice to dress as she wishes, to leave her hair uncovered, to dance and flirt in underground clubs – even as sections of Algerian society insist that young women like her should be neither seen nor heard. The building of a wall around her all-female university dormitory takes on a symbolic resonance: those who choose not to wear the traditional veil or “haik” will be covered up, one way or another. But when the slow-burning fuse of the Algerian civil war ignites, and blood is spilled, Nedjma is inspired to use the haik as the basis for a fashion show. Like the denim jacket in Marjane Satrapi’s <em>Persepolis</em>, Nedjma’s dresses are a form of protest.</p><p>Mounia Meddour’s feature debut is loosely based on her own experiences. Shot in the shimmering, saturated colour palette of a teenager’s eyeshadow cache, the film uses a jostling, intimate camera that places us in Nedjma’s feisty inner circle. While the final act frays a little, the sparking tensions of female friendship are vivid and persuasive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/08/papicha-review-mounia-meddour-debut-civil-war-algeria-design-student">Continue reading...</a>

However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods.

<p>Hoverfly larvae devour blackfly, so welcome them by planting the umbels they love</p><p>I’m not sure about your garden, but mine has been awash with blackfly (<em>Aphis fabae</em>) this year. They started on their namesake, the broad beans, hopped over the nasturtiums and are now having fun on the runner beans and numerous flowers, from chrysanthemums to dahlias. I’ve been patiently waiting for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/22/when-aphids-attack" title="">ladybird larvae to deal with them</a>, but they are late this year; I assume the wet winter decimated overwinter adults.</p><p>Thus my joy at finding hoverfly larvae hoovering up aphids is palpable. The larvae of the pretty, gossamer-winged hoverfly are a broad church of diners. Some like to eat plants and others are predatory, feeding on micromoth larvae, plant lice and scale insects. However, about 40% of the UK species (there are 165) like to eat a lot of aphids.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/aug/08/how-to-control-aphids-in-your-garden">Continue reading...</a>

It had no boundary: wildflowers drifted in like flotsam from the tide, arranged enticingly around a tarred timber cottage in the company of shimmering helichrysum and cotton lavender. “I made a beeline for that colour,” Lloyd later reflected, and the two wandered through, elated, scribbling notes and marvelling at plants thriving in the scorched shingle. “How surprised we were when the door opened and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/derek-jarman" title="">Derek Jarman</a> stepped out,” Lloyd wrote.

<p>The Nigerian pop star on Black Lives Matter, how British fans find it easier to tune into his wavelength – and why everyone’s got it wrong about Muammar Gaddafi<br /></p><p>Burna Boy might be Africa’s biggest music star, but when he speaks, it’s hard to place exactly where he’s from. Ask him about the US, and a mid-Atlantic lilt comes into play; quiz him on his time in the UK, and he sounds more like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/skepta" title="">Skepta</a> than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/may/25/artsfeatures" title="">King Sunny Ade</a>. But when he talks about his beloved Nigeria, the rich tones of the west African country are exposed, and it’s this that has made him arguably the continent’s most sought-after musical export. “I don’t really speak one language and I don’t only talk one way. That shows in the music,” he says, referring to the fact that he sings in a mix of Yoruba, Igbo and pidgin English. Is that to make a political point? “It’s not a statement – it’s just me being who I am.” And who is that exactly? The music site Pitchfork described him as an “<a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/burna-boy-african-giant/" title="">everyman, local griot, global ambassador, party-starter</a>”, but before we can find out, we have to get hold of him.</p><p>Getting in touch with Burna Boy isn’t easy. After a couple of false starts, his sister, who has been tasked with ensuring the interview takes place, answers the phone. As the handset is passed around, I get a tour of the living room in his Lagos home. It looks a bit like the <a href="https://a-clockwork-orange.fandom.com/wiki/Korova_Milkbar" title="">Korova Milkbar</a> from A Clockwork Orange, all geometric shapes and bursts of dazzling white. Then, after a few moments, the phone is put in front of Burna Boy, who says hello before picking up a PS4 joypad and carrying on a game of Grand Theft Auto. “I love the helicopter, you know,” he says, as I struggle to wrestle his attention from the on-screen destruction. It’s hardly an encouraging start. I’m told he hates it when journalists expect long, detailed answers if he feels a short, curt response is all that’s needed. “If you ask a question, he’s gonna answer it honestly, but it’s not gonna be a very long answer,” says a member of his team before we get started. In the end, however, it turns out he has quite a lot to say.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/08/burna-boy-brothers-in-the-us-have-been-stripped-of-their-knowledge-of-self">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s something about finger food that appeals to all of us – especially if it’s fruity, sweet and sticky</p><p>I was raised around an Indian kitchen table, which meant I ate with my hands. There was no designated “finger food”: it was<em> all </em>finger food, which is why I have a particular fondness for any dish that suggests, in name or form, that you don’t need cutlery to eat it. These American-style hand pies are a case in point: they are essentially neat little sugared parcels crammed with as much fruit as you can squeeze in. Peaches and strawberries are my favourites, though you can use any fruit that will go jammy and soft and boil out of the top of pastry, creating a chewy, pastille-like jelly that you can peel off with your teeth when the pies have cooled.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/aug/08/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-peach-and-strawberry-hand-pies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More 18- 24-year-olds are anxious about careers as coronavirus hits jobs and mental health</p><p>Raymond Christie is having sleepless nights. The 18-year-old is worrying about how difficult it will be to find work opportunities as he anticipates an upcoming recession. Christie left school at 16 with no qualifications and went into training on a construction scheme that went into administration during the pandemic. Since then, he has had to rely on his family for financial support.</p><p>“My mental health has never been as bad as it has been over the last few months since my mid-teens,” he says. “Losing my place in something that I really enjoyed doing and the overwhelming feeling of uncertainty has made me struggle with deep moods of depression and boredom. Most days, I don’t want to do anything or get up from my bed and I find it hard to motivate myself with nothing to do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/aug/08/covid-financial-stress-young-people-coronavirus-jobs">Continue reading...</a>

## After Wiley, I didn’t have a fight on my hands for once. Why did that feel so weird? | Hadley Freeman

<p>Suddenly I had all this time that I’d expected to fill with arguing the antisemitism any fool could see was, yes, antisemitic</p><p>I’ll say this for Wiley: at least he showed where the red line was. Because honestly, over the past five years, it hasn’t always been so clear to us Jews. But now we know: it takes a middle-aged grime artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/28/wileys-facebook-and-instagram-accounts-deactivated-after-antisemitic-remarks" title="">tweeting that Jews should be shot</a> for there to be general agreement that this seems pretty antisemitic. So thanks, Wiley!</p><p>I was away the weekend Wiley posted what the <a href="https://twitter.com/Baddiel/status/1286785089330872320" title="">NME described as “Israel tweets”</a>. But when I later caught up, I experienced a strange sensation: people seemed to be… taking this seriously. The NME aside, no one was insisting this was just about Israel. OK sure, <a href="https://www.voice-online.co.uk/entertainment/music/2020/07/29/systemic-oppression-and-wiley/" title="">a journalist in</a> <a href="https://www.voice-online.co.uk/entertainment/music/2020/07/29/systemic-oppression-and-wiley/" title="">The Voice</a> casually referred to “the hypothesis that you need to get a Jewish lawyer in order to progress in the music business… I’ve never seen anyone Jewish refute or confirm this” . But in the main, everyone agreed this was Not Good, and to show their displeasure they refrained from tweeting for 48 hours (if only someone had thought of that in 1939). It was bizarre: suddenly I had all this time on my hands I’d expected to fill with arguing that the antisemitism any fool could see was, yes, antisemitic. Perhaps I should take up knitting?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/commentisfree/2020/aug/08/after-wiley-didnt-have-a-fight-on-my-hands-for-once">Continue reading...</a>

But to me, the 2020 longlist has got everything; <em>The Mirror </em><em>&amp; the Light</em>, obviously, because the literary world would collapse in on itself if any prize ignored the trials and tribulations of Cromwell via Mantel. It’s got American debuts from Kiley Reid and Brandon Taylor, who said of his novel <em>Real Life:</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/05/brandon-taylor-author-real-life-interview">“I didn’t write this book for the white gaze”</a>, which is only a good thing. It’s got some “best of British” offerings from Sophie Ward, Douglas Stuart and Gabriel Krauze; <em>Who They Was</em>, Krauze’s autobiographical novel detailing his life in a gang, is one that I had to stop and start repeatedly because it’s a little bit too real. But it is exceptional – it deserves a place on this list.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/08/at-last-a-booker-prize-longlist-i-want-to-read">Continue reading...</a>

When I lifted a forkful, exposing a writhing knot of thin red worms, in a whirr of wings he darted down and with crammed beak retreated to his vantage point, dropping his dinner to foot level and pinioning it there with a long, elegant leg.

There followed a few days of brooding by the hen, with the cock flying daylong to and fro with a beak full of green caterpillars, which he’d give to his mate to feed the fledglings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/aug/08/country-diary-an-endearing-little-scrap-of-life-darts-round-the-garden">Continue reading...</a>
