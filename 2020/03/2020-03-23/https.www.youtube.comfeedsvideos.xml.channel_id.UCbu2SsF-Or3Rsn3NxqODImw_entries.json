We go over its many ups and down over the last 7 years.\n\nIn the video above we go over the history from its rocky release in 2013 to 2020. The Xbox One went over several iterations from the original Xbox One, to the slim Xbox One S, to the powerful Xbox One X. Figureheads such as Don Mattrick and Phil Spencer have influenced the Xbox One\u2019 history for better and for worse. Many games were created and canceled.\n\n#XboxOne #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-852aBzdHYQ", "date_published": "2020-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ghost Recon Breakpoint Immersive Mode Update: Everything You Need To Know In Under 2 Minutes", "description": "Ghost Recon Breakpoint is adding Immersive mode, challenging you to play with limited resources and no weapon leveling. Here's everything you need to know about the free update--and look for Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher too.\n\nGhost Recon Breakpoint is getting a new Immersive mode in its next update. Immersive mode limits your health regeneration, resources, and HUD, and eliminates the tiered loot system. You'll customize the same on or two primary firearms throughout your journey, unless you loot new weapons from fallen enemies.\n\nImmersive mode is one of three ways to play through the game via the Ghost Experience, Ubisoft's official title for the new update. Another way to play is Regular mode, which is the Breakpoint you're used to. Finally, Custom mode lets you tweak a series of rules including injury risk from enemy bullets, number of bandages you can carry, and availability of Maria's Shop. These are detailed in the video above.\n\nThe Ghost Experience update is planned for a March 24 release date on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. That's the same day Splinter Cell crosses over with the franchise again.\n\n#GhostReconBreakpoint #ImmersiveMode #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZOTwnC31LE", "date_published": "2020-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Half-Life: Alyx - Things I Wish I Knew Before Playing", "description": "Here's how to dodge Headcrabs, kill Combine with Gravity Gloves, solve puzzles, and survive in Half-Life: Alyx.\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx is a tremendous experience that amplifies the best qualities of the series by leveraging the potential of VR in many ways.
