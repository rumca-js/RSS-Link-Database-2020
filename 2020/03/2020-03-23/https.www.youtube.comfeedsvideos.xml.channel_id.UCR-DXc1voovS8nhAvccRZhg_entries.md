In this eight livestream, we manually migrated the Blog view (which included a Blog landing page, a blog.xml RSS feed, and a 'Recent Blog Posts' block) from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. Then we worked on styling and theming the Blog landing page, incorporating a theme hook suggestion to add a 'visually-hidden' class to the Blog landing page's title so it would not display but would still be present for those using screen readers.
