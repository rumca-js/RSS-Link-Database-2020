<p>Jobs seen as lowly are now recognised as key, and nationalising the railways is no longer controversial. Many things we thought were true a few weeks ago no longer are</p><p>All the things that were taken to be self-evident a couple of weeks ago are no longer so. That is how fast this epidemic is spreading. Having known liars in charge of telling us the truth – whether Boris Johnson or Donald Trump – does not help. “Truth is mighty and will prevail,” said Mark Twain, before adding: “There is nothing wrong with this, except it ain’t so.”</p><p>It certainly ain’t so and what we are seeing is mass cognitive dissonance. That is the stress produced when people seek some kind of consistency between how they think life is and what we may call reality. It is really discomforting to be given information that does not fit in with your beliefs. This results in denial or in justification for actions that do not fit the situation. Sometimes we may simply refuse to believe what we are told, attempting to resolve the contradiction between our inner and outer worlds by believing whatever we want to believe. This is precisely why behavioural changes are so hard to make and why messages have to be clear. Cognitive dissonance is coming from the top down, as well as from the bottom up. There is little difference between a government reluctance to announce a lockdown and people having barbecues together in the parks. It is way easier to blame all this on Johnson’s adviser, Dominic Cummings, than to see it as a collective political failure. If anyone needs to “take back control” it is each of us now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-nationalising-railways-distance-death">Continue reading...</a>

## The Jesus Rolls review – John Turturro's Big Lebowski spin-off misses the mark

<p>Turturro’s return to the role of the bowling champ he played in the Coen brothers’ cherished classic is an amiably indifferent caper</p><p>John Turturro’s planned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/20/the-second-coming-of-jesus-how-the-big-lebowski-bowler-was-resurrected">return</a> to the universe of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/sep/20/the-big-lebowski-review-the-dude-jeff-bridges-coen-brothers">The Big Lebowski</a> was announced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/aug/18/big-lebowski-john-turturro-jesus-going-places">four years ago</a> with a fanfare as a much-anticipated spin-off from one of cinema’s most cherished cult items. With its belated theatrical release nixed by the coronavirus, The Jesus Rolls has now snuck out on streaming platforms. It appears key creative personnel lost faith or patience along the way: these choppy 85 minutes comprise a sunnily indifferent caper, displaying next to none of the Coens’ visual invention, and little of their wit. At best, what you get is an amiable footnote.</p><p>Turturro follows the road taken by Bertrand Blier in 1974’s bad-taste classic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/102895/valseuses">Les Valseuses</a> (AKA Going Places), replaying pivotal couplings and conversations, albeit with a sensibility too goofy to push as far or as forcefully as Blier. Released from Sing Sing, bowling baller Jesus Quintana is met by old pal Pete (Bobby Cannavale), and the pair bounce around the fringes of New York state, picking up braless nympho (Audrey Tautou, helpless in the face of a 1974-era characterisation) and encountering endless cameoing celebs: Jon Hamm as an arsey coiffeur, Pete Davidson as somebody’s unclaimed son, Susan Sarandon smartly cast in the Jeanne Moreau role as a soured drifter seeking one final fling. Mostly, though, everyone is driving around looking for the one compelling reason for the film to exist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/23/the-jesus-rolls-review-the-big-lebowski-john-turturro">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Garry Marshall’s hit romantic comedy might have some questionable sexual politics but Julia Roberts remains a magnetic breakout</p><p>There are a lot of fantasies at play in Pretty Woman, the hit romantic comedy that transformed Julia Roberts into one of the biggest stars in Hollywood virtually overnight 30 years ago. It’s a fantasy about a humble Georgia girl getting her fairytale ending. It’s a fantasy about upward mobility on the streets and salons of Beverly Hills. It’s a fantasy about turning Roberts herself into a modern-day Audrey Hepburn, prim and elegant and absolutely certain to know which type of fork is appropriate for each course.

<p>The Sherlock star joined Robin Ince and Josie Long’s daily online broadcast to self-isolated comedy fans – and the results were rallying</p><p><strong>‘</strong>Stay apart – and keep connecting,” is the mantra of Robin Ince’s new <a href="https://cosmicshambles.com/stayathome/live">Stay at Home festival</a>, a daily online broadcast to self-isolated comedy fans everywhere. Produced by the <a href="https://cosmicshambles.com/">Cosmic Shambles Network</a>, the show brings comedians, entertainers and scientists together (at a safe social distance), and hopes to raise donations for artists denied an income by the coronavirus outbreak. Its first episode proper, streamed this morning, is distinguished – as you’d expect from Ince – by recondite but infectiously enthusiastic chat, now and then interrupted by cookery and song. It’s not must-see viewing, but its good humour and jaundiced optimism are oddly rallying.</p><p>Hosted by Ince and Josie Long, broadcasting from their houses, its star guest is Mark Gatiss, for whom Ince has canvassed audience questions. By accident or Ince’s design, they prompt nerdy discussions (which would work equally well as audio) about horror movies, Peter Cushing’s memoirs, or this week’s auction of the estate of Sixties TV icon Peter Wyngarde. Of 1970s dystopian drama, Gatiss observes that “we’ve been workshopping this [ie the coronavirus response] for donkey’s years … All TV was dystopian in the 70s, even Nationwide.” But that doesn’t mean Brits are well placed to weather a catastrophe. Talk of our blitz spirit is “clearly not true”, says the Sherlock man: “We are just a pack of savages.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/23/stay-at-home-festival-review-mark-gatiss-robin-ince-josie-long">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the series Comedy Against Living Miserably launches, two comedians explain how their jobs affect their emotional wellbeing – and how they hope to help their audiences</p><p>“Every time you get depressed, comedy will be there to drag your ass out of it,” said Robin Williams in 1996. It is a gut-punch of a quote, considering that depression was one of the factors that led to his death 18 years later (although his wife has said the main reason for his suicide was probably <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/robin-williams-disintegrating-before-suicide-widow-says">the debilitating brain disease diffuse Lewy body dementia</a>). It also speaks to a nagging sense that there is some truth to the “tears of a clown” cliche: that many of those who seek to make us laugh are masking private sadness.</p><p>The list of comedy greats who have had some form of mental illness is long: Richard Pryor, Spike Milligan, Caroline Aherne, Stephen Fry, Joan Rivers and Kenneth Williams to name a few. The doubters say that it is no more common among comics than anyone else – they are just more cognisant of the bad stuff in the world and have the outlet to talk about it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/23/comedy-is-my-way-of-making-sense-of-life-the-comics-standing-up-for-mental-health">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From charging options to battery life – we put your concerns about going electric to an expert</p><p>There’s a disconnect between the reality and the perception of electric vehicles (EV). Forecasts suggest a medium-term crossover point, probably towards the end of this decade, where the car industry is making more EVs than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. Against that, there still exists a great deal of scepticism in the minds of consumers.</p><p>“An EV wouldn’t work for me because …”<em> </em>is a familiar conversation starter. It’s true, there are some people for whom an electric car is simply a non-starter – but that number is a vanishingly small percentage of the population. For most, an EV is going to be a money saver that makes no obvious impact on lifestyle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2020/mar/23/the-ev-clinic-your-electric-car-questions-answered">Continue reading...</a>

That the Olympics could take place a week or two after. That a bumper summer of sport will give the nation the mother of all pick‑me‑ups. It is an epic delusion. And, frankly, we have had enough of them already.</p><p>Over the weekend I spoke to a leading expert, who is involved with the national response to the coronavirus pandemic, to ask him when sport as we know it – in front of packed crowds – might return.
