<p>Evidence obtained by the Guardian exposes a coordinated and unlawful EU assault on the rights of desperate people trying to cross the Mediterranean</p><p>As night fell on 26 March 2019, two small boats made their way north across the Mediterranean. The rubber crafts were flimsy; it would be nearly impossible for those onboard to make it to Europe without help. From the north, a twin-propeller aeroplane from the European Union naval force approached. From the south, the coastguard from the country they had just fled, Libya, was coming.</p><p>The aircraft arrived first but there would be no rescue from Europe. Instead the flight, callsign Seagull 75, radioed the Libyans telling them where to find the boats. But Libya’s would-be interceptors would need more than just the coordinates. “OK sir, my radar is not good, is not good, if you stay [over the boat] I will follow you,” said the coastguard, according to recordings of VHF marine radio picked up by a nearby ship.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/revealed-the-great-european-refugee-scandal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While Richard Alston’s company hang up their dance shoes, archivists and choreographers are grasping at ways to immortalise an inherently slippery art form</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/feb/27/richard-alston-dancers-choreographer">Richard Alston</a>’s dance company performed their final shows after more than 25 years. It was a celebratory occasion – and the end of an era. Alston will continue choreographing independently, but with his company he created a significant body of work, defining a lyrical, light-footed style of English contemporary dance. What happens to that work now? Since dance has no product to collect or put in galleries, how do you hold on to this ephemeral art form?</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/08/richard-alston-dance-company-review-a-thrilling-farewell">Richard Alston Dance Company review – a thrilling farewell</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/12/step-in-time-how-to-save-the-legacy-of-dance-from-being-lost-in-history">Continue reading...</a>

As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy.</p><p>As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time.</p><p>I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus.</p><p>I think that’s the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.</p><p>There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They’re having a leadership contest, so we can’ formally start that process until they have one.</p><p>For those that don’t [have access to statutory sick pay] we’ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people.</p><p>We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra £500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support. </p><p>This is a safety net. That is what it’s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It’s obviously not the same as your day to day life</p><p>Because what we’ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people’s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don’t go out of business during that period of time.</p><p>You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that’s a judgment I have to make as chancellor.</p><p>The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it’s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-03-12T09:29:35.590Z">9.29am <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Stock markets around the wall are down following President Trump’s travel ban announcement.

<p>Campuses have become ‘ghost towns’ as staffers depart – but many contractors still have to show up</p><p>When Josh Borden arrived for work at the Google offices in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday morning, it felt like arriving in a “ghost town”. The parking lot was deserted, there was no breakfast being served in the cafeteria, and the nap rooms were tagged with signs announcing their closure “as a precaution given the Covid-19 situation”. “The office is so empty,” he told me. “Even more so than when the Googlers have their ski trip.”</p><p>The day before, Google had asked all its North American employees to begin working from home due to the coronavirus – a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/10/tech/google-work-from-home-coronavirus/index.html">policy</a> that has since been expanded to the rest of its global workforce.

## Silver Sparrow by Tayari Jones review – a tale of two sisters

<p>From the winner of last year’s Women’s prize, a wise and moving story about two teenagers linked by their bigamist father</p><p>Following the success of Tayari Jones’s 2019 Women’s prize winner <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/02/an-american-marriage-tayari-jones-review" title="">An American Marriage</a></em>, her 2011 third novel <em>Silver Sparrow</em> is published for the first time in the UK. It’s a tale of two sisters: part Bildungsroman, part homage to 1980s Atlanta. “My father, James Witherspoon, is a bigamist,” Dana Yarboro tells us in the novel’s opening line, before she narrates what it was like to grow up as the secret daughter, given “second pick for everything”, consoled only by the slim satisfaction of knowing all about her father’s other family while her sister Chaurisse knows nothing about her.</p><p>A chance encounter between the two girls at a science fair, wearing identical rabbit-fur coats (gifts from their “double-duty daddy”), knocks Witherspoon’s two families into each other’s paths. Chaurisse is drawn to Dana, whom she sees as “silver” – one of those “girls with looks and hair” who “move in different circles than ones like me” – but little does she know that Dana is obsessed with her. Every interaction is undercut by Dana’s ulterior motives: Chaurisse tells Dana her father smokes two packs a day and she responds, “Mine too”; when Dana visits Chaurisse’s house, she quizzes her on where her father sits when they eat dinner. Her coming of age consists in large part of inserting herself further into her unwitting sister’s life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/12/silver-sparrow-tayari-jones-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Robbie Williams to Russell Brand and Jacob Rees-Mogg, dads who boast about not doing childcare sound more like 50s throwbacks than cheeky rebels</p><p>It’s the hot new dad-brag and all the best men are using it: I don’t change nappies. You want to know what I do? Diddly-squat, that’s what. “It is all right, I have lots of help – hot and cold running staff,” Robbie Williams told the US show Access Hollywood, speaking of the birth of his fourth child. So that’s all right then. His wife, Ayda Field, may not have a hands-on husband, but he knows how to raise a smile with a cheeky metaphor likening his economic inferiors to household plumbing. That’s a keeper.</p><p>This dad-as-50s-throwback routine last took a parade with Russell Brand, who admitted last year that nobody would really trust him to look after his own children for 24 hours. That isn’t really what a father is any more, we cried in dismay – like a babysitter, only grumpier and less competent. That’s not really what domestic intimacy and respect is about. But Jacob Rees-Mogg had already effortlessly scooped the title of Worst Dad, In Every Way, two years before, when he said that he had had six children and never changed a nappy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/12/a-bad-smell-why-do-some-dads-brag-about-not-changing-nappies">Continue reading...</a>

## Could sitting in a salt cave cure my nasal congestion? | Adrian Chiles

<p>I have never been able to breathe through my nose. I’ve tried sprays, inhalers, rinses – even an operation. Is salt therapy the answer?</p><p>I write this sitting in a salt cave in Brentford, of all places. It is not an actual cave – I don’t think there are such things in this part of west London. It is a room full of salt, all over the walls and soft beneath your feet, like sand. And into this room is pumped, essentially, salty air (there is more to it than that). I was brought here by a good friend of mine, who has not long turned 60, and is in otherwise rude health. But he has a lung condition, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which, in the unsettling language of these troubled times, I dare say would constitute an underlying health condition.</p><p>Salt therapy is believed by many to be good for respiratory issues, skin conditions and relaxation. My friend suggested I try it when I told him about my nose. It has been the bane of my life. I can’t breathe very well out of it, you see. I’ve got a theory, comprehensively untested, that this is because I’m from Birmingham. I think we might speak the way we do because we’re all as congested as the elevated section of the M6 as it passes over Spaghetti Junction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/salt-cave-nasal-congestion-adrian-chiles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Savills, who manage the building, charge us £3,000 a year, but seem indifferent to our plight</p><p><strong>I purchased a £500,000 flat in January 2018. The building, Millstream House, is managed by Savills and has a central boiler that supplies heating and hot water to all 59 apartments. A month after I moved in there was no hot water or heating. Savills managed to fix the issue after three weeks with no compensation or apologies. The same outage has since occurred again on six occasions. Recently it failed again and engineers were unable to restore it, leaving residents without heat or hot water for three days. We pay around £3,000 a year for management fees, but Savills seems indifferent. <em>TC, Oxford</em></strong></p><p>It sounds as though the development has a district heating system which uses a network of insulated pipes to distribute heat from a local generator. District heating causes lower emissions than conventional systems and has been encouraged by the government, but there are problems. Suppliers don’t have to be licensed so Ofgem has no powers to ensure standards and customers are locked into contracts of 25 years or more with limited access to redress if problems arise. Residents who’ve bought properties that rely on the system, often unwittingly, have also complained of extortionate, unclear bills. Many, like you, have to rely on the managing agent to sort any problems rather than summoning a technician to their home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/12/shared-hot-water-and-heating-in-my-block-keeps-breaking">Continue reading...</a>

Privilege means this former minister gets promoted despite having no clue about whether ships exist or how trains move<p>We’ve all made those meals. The hastily prepared tomato sauce that tasted of nothing, mixed into your pasta. And yet somehow through a combination of laziness and misplaced hope that maybe, just maybe, it will taste better once it rests, you just don’t seem to be able to throw it in the compost bin, and so instead you reheat it the next night, adding some beans, paprika and other guff to transform it into an equally unpalatable chilli. By the end of the week, you’ve still not managed to go shopping,, can’t afford to eat out and out comes the chilli, this time to ruin a previously innocent baked potato. That night you leap out of bed covered with a sweaty film of regret, a rush of tomato, bean, potato and bile rushing up your throat and decorating your toilet.The leftover tomato topping sits patiently in the freezer awaiting its next culinary promotion.</p><p>Chris Grayling is that tomato sauce. The man has the unerring ability to botch almost everything he touches, and yet somehow this brilliant government of ours seems unable to ditch him. We’ve all worked with this middle-aged man: he’s the grating greyscale colleague constantly falling upwards because senior management never seem quite able to tell him that he’s just not that good at his job. Heaven forbid they puncture a grown man’s pride. And so they just move him to another role, often one higher up. As long as he’s away from his old desk and wearing a new tie the hope is, presumably, that he’ll have magically transformed, like a home counties version of Knight Rider, into someone capable. The reality is, this never happens, and so the vicious cycle continues.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/chris-grayling-poisons-rises-privilege-promoted">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Take a city break in style – but still on a budget – at these hostels with great design (and decent grub) in Birmingham, Edinburgh, Newcastle, Liverpool and London</p><p><strong>What’s it like?</strong><br />Without endorsing Insta-tourists, I challenge anyone not to share photos of Selina. Snaps of a weekend spent at its newest UK branch, in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter, were met with heart-eye emojis and “that hotel looks beautiful!” comments. The fact it’s a hostel – with affordable pet-friendly suite rooms (plus dorms), a yoga studio and a South American-style restaurant due to open in the summer – was something I revelled in sharing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/12/five-best-new-uk-hostels-budget-travel-london-edinburgh-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>

## What can Britain learn about containing Covid-19 from countries that got it right? | Philip Ball

There are too many unknowns to make reliable predictions, but Hong Kong and Singapore should be Britain’s role models<p>Are we doing Covid-19 right? With the number of new reported cases of infection declining rapidly in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/xi-jinping-visits-wuhan-for-first-time-since-coronavirus-outbreak-began" title="">China</a>, but soaring in what is now a semi-locked-down <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/from-confidence-to-quarantine-how-coronavirus-swept-italy" title="">Italy</a>, it’s worth looking at the experiences and strategies of countries to see what can be learned. Governments are faced with stark choices, says Roy Anderson of Imperial College in London, one of the UK’s most eminent epidemiologists. There are essentially four options. You could try to minimise the number of fatalities or the economic impact. You could attempt to flatten the peaked curve in the incidence so that the cases are not all concentrated in a narrow time span, which could overwhelm healthcare resources (already severely stretched in the UK). Or you could try to delay the spread in order to buy time for development of a vaccine – although most experts don’t expect one to be available for at least a year.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/who-declares-coronavirus-pandemic">WHO declares coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/britain-containing-covid-19-countries-hong-kong-singapore">Continue reading...</a>

## Was the Millennium Dome really so bad? The inside story of a (not so) total disaster

<p>Even before it opened, the Dome had become a byword for failure. But two decades on, it could be time for a reassessment. By Imogen West-Knights</p><p>The first inhabited place on Earth to ring in the year 2000 was probably the Pacific island nation of Kiribati. As dancers on the beaches welcomed the dawn of the millennium, on the other side of the planet, in Greenwich, final preparations were underway for the opening ceremony of the Millennium Dome. This was the night when the first 10,000 specially invited people would finally see what was inside the big white tent in south-east London that had been the subject of intense speculation and scrutiny for the previous four years. It had to be perfect.</p><p>By 7pm in Greenwich, it was apparent that there was a problem. In the weeks before the event, because of a logistical cock-up, hundreds of guests had not received their tickets through the post. Ticketless guests had been instructed to pick them up on New Year’s Eve at Stratford station, before hopping on the newly completed Jubilee line to the Dome for the festivities. But on the night, body scanners installed by police at Stratford weren’t working, and before long, several hundred people were stuck in the station. When the prime minister, Tony Blair, arrived two hours later – while fireworks illuminated more than 1 million people gathered in Moscow’s Red Square – angry invitees, including many of the UK’s newspaper editors, were still no closer to boarding a train to Greenwich.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/12/millennium-dome-experience-disaster-inside-story-new-labour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More and more of us are giving up fast fashion. But could you go for 10 years without shopping? Guardian readers tell us how – and why – they have</p><p>When the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq told the hosts of Loose Women that she had not bought any clothes in a decade, she was met with consternation and shock from the show’s famously forthright panellists. “You’re not still wearing Blue Peter clothes!” exclaimed Janet Street-Porter. Huq acknowledged, sheepishly, that the lilac cardigan she was wearing did in fact date from her days on children’s TV.</p><p>Huq’s decision to step away from consumerism and wear the clothes she already has is to be commended, given that the UK <a href="https://www.wrap.org.uk/content/clothing-waste-prevention" title="">sends around £140m</a>-worth of clothing to landfill every year. And, as the public becomes increasingly aware of the social and environmental impact of the fashion industry, it is likely that more will do the same. Already consumers are turning away from fast fashion. New research from the <a href="https://dailybusinessgroup.co.uk/2020/03/gretas-green-plea-turns-shoppers-against-fast-fashion/" title="">Fashion Retail Academy</a> finds that 51% of Brits are opting to purchase expensive but longer-lasting clothes, rather than cheaper throwaway items, up from 33% a year ago. Many attribute this move towards more sustainable consumer behaviour to the so-called “Greta” effect. (Famously, the 17-year-old Swedish climate activist, Greta Thunberg, doesn’t buy new clothes, telling Democracy Now that <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2019/9/11/greta_thunberg_swedish_activist_climate_crisis" title="">she shops secondhand</a>, or wears other people’s hand-me-downs.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/12/i-wear-my-grandads-old-boxers-meet-the-people-who-havent-bought-clothes-for-a-decade">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Their drummer Lars Ulrich called me up and I kept avoiding him – I thought he looked like an idiot. But I shot them in 1984 and have worked with them ever since’</p><p>This was taken at the last show of Metallica’s Black Album tour, in Belgium on 1 July 1993. James Hetfield, the singer and guitarist, had walked to the very edge of what they called their “ego ramp” [the walkway into the audience]. Because they were touring The Black Album, I was shooting a lot in black and white. I noticed him, with the sunset behind him and the arms coming up, and it became one of my most famous Metallica pictures. It shows the connection between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/apr/19/metallica-the-band-who-reinvented-metal">Metallica</a> and their audience – it’s as if they are almost dragging him in. The time of day was important: most bands don’t like daylight, they want it dark. This was shot at twilight, which gives you the perfect balance and that sense of moment. Five minutes later, it would have been dark, and the shot would have looked nothing like that.</p><p>My aim when shooting a show is to give somebody something they would not normally have seen. And to create an image that is unusual or exciting, so when people who went to the show look at it, they see something that’s special. People who shoot shows tend to panic, but if you do that, you get nothing. Stand back and wait. Think about what you’re doing – I learned that from <a href="https://photos.com/collections/fin+costello">Fin Costello</a>. I don’t find it hard to get original images from live shows, because I know what I’m doing – I’ve done it for so long. Nowadays, a lot of bands want to control everything and they ban photographers from shows. Yet they’re quite happy, having thrown out the people doing it properly, to let anybody take bad pictures or film it on an iPhone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/12/metallica-james-hetfield-ross-halfin-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

## We should stop buying fish until the industry stops slaughtering dolphins | George Monbiot

Britain and the EU are complicit in hundreds of deaths a year in their refusal to impose effective rules on commercial fishing<p>How many people want dolphins killed? Apart from the psychopath <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/11/florida-dolphins-dead-gulf-coast" title="">shooting them in Florida</a>, and the Japanese hunters slaughtering them every year in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-49547400" title="">Taiji cove</a>, I would hazard a guess at none. They are perhaps the world’s most loved wild animals. Yet, every day, dolphin killers form an orderly queue, at supermarket checkouts in the UK and around the world. If you are buying fish, and there is no clear and watertight guarantee, you are likely to be complicit in something that would revolt you.</p><p>A horrifying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/03/more-than-80-of-indian-ocean-dolphins-may-have-been-killed-by-commercial-fishing-study-finds" title="">report</a> last week showed that dolphin numbers in the Indian Ocean have fallen by 87% since 1980, as they’ve been drowned in gill nets set for tuna. But the problem is not confined to distant seas, or to tuna fisheries. On average, two dolphins or porpoises are <a href="https://www.zsl.org/science/news/4896-marine-mammals-stranded-on-uk-coast-in-seven-years" title="">washed up on UK beaches</a> every day. Many of them show the scrapes and indentations caused by fishing nets. Discoveries of dead dolphins around the Bay of Biscay this year are likely to beat the grisly record set in 2019, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/31/mutilated-dolphins-wash-up-on-french-coast-in-record-numbers" title="">1,100 were found</a> on the French coast.

Pessimistic analysts said this might be the start of a global “bear market”. But what have hairy quadrupeds got to do with it?</p><p>This is one of those terms for which the internet offers various competing “folk etymologies”, which is the linguist’s polite term for nonsense. Bear markets are named because bears attack by swiping their paws downwards? No. The origin in fact lies in the old proverb warning that you shouldn’t sell a bear’s skin before you have caught the bear. In the 18th century, speculators who did sell borrowed commodities before they had paid for them – in anticipation of profiting from a fall in price – were therefore called “bearskin jobbers”, later shortened to “bears”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/12/bear-markets-word-of-the-week">Continue reading...</a>
