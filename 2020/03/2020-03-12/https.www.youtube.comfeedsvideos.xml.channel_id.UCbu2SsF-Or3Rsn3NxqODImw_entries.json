As the final character for the current Kombat Pack, he follows in the footsteps of other guest characters like The Terminator and The Joker, who incorporate their unique personalities and combat styles into the MK universe. Recently, we had the chance to go hands-on with Spawn, and we certainly got to see his abrasive and no-nonsense personality in full display.\n\nEver since his debut in 1992, Spawn has never been one to mince words. When he's confronted with a character that rubs him the wrong way, he'll be sure to let them know outright. In this video, we've mashed up some of the most vulgar and meanest fight intros from Spawn in Mortal Kombat 11. Voiced by Keith David, the same actor who portrayed the character in the HBO animated series from 1997, the undead fighter lets loose with insults and the hostilities when facing off against the likes of The Joker and Shao Kahn.\n\nIn addition to the new character, this next update for Mortal Kombat 11 will also introduce new Matinee-themed costumes for Jacqui Briggs, Kotal Kahn, and Erron Black inspired by pulp-adventure serials from the 1930s. Along with that, Jacqui Briggs will get another outfit inspired by Spawn, giving her the appearance of a hellspawn as well.\n\nSpawn is the final character of the current Kombat Pack for Mortal Kombat 11, and he'll be available to current owners on March 17, while non-Kombat Pack owners will be able to purchase him separately on March 24.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvIKoCbzWo", "date_published": "2020-03-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Super Mario Lego - It's Lego Mario Time Trailer", "description": "LEGO and Mario finally team up!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lin_rdw82HE", "date_published": "2020-03-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
