As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy.</p><p>As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time.</p><p>I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus.</p><p>I think that\u2019s the right thing to do for the economy, we need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.</p><p>There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They\u2019re having a leadership contest, so we can\u2019 formally start that process until they have one.</p><p>For those that don\u2019t [have access to statutory sick pay] we\u2019ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people.</p><p>We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra \u00a3500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support. </p><p>This is a safety net. That is what it\u2019s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It\u2019s obviously not the same as your day to day life</p><p>Because what we\u2019ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people\u2019s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don\u2019t go out of business during that period of time.</p><p>You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that\u2019s a judgment I have to make as chancellor.</p><p>The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it\u2019s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that.</p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T09:29:35.590Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Stock markets around the wall are down following President Trump\u2019s travel ban announcement.
