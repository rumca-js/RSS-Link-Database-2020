<p>Disabled 10-year-old cannot leave until Manchester council settles his homeless family</p><p>A 10-year-old boy has been living on an acute NHS medical ward for nearly a year despite being well enough to be discharged because the local council has failed to find appropriate accommodation for his homeless family, the Guardian has learned.</p><p>The boy, Ahmed, has developmental disabilities including cerebral palsy and scoliosis, is fed through a tube and is registered blind. He was admitted to the Royal Manchester children’s hospital on 1 March last year with breathing difficulties. Within six weeks, he had recovered enough to be discharged, but his doctors refused to let him leave as the family were homeless and “sofa surfing” in a friend’s living room.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/09/severely-disabled-boy-stuck-in-acute-nhs-bed-for-nearly-a-year">Continue reading...</a>

I am disgusted with my body. I loathe it. If I could migrate the whole of my personality and face on to another body, I’d be delighted.”</p><p>It is a better indication than anything that follows of the depths of the tyranny of thinness.

## Vardy and Barnes put Villa to sword as Leicester end winless run in style

<p>If Leicester end up qualifying for the Champions League next season then Brendan Rodgers may be tempted to send his regards to Pepe Reina. The Aston Villa goalkeeper fell out spectacularly with Rodgers when he took over at Liverpool before being shown the door, but on Monday night it was the veteran’s rush of blood to the head at the end of the first half that gifted his former manager a priceless first league victory since the end of January.</p><p>A second-half double from Jamie Vardy – his first goals since December – after he came off the bench and a second for the superb Harvey Barnes wrapped up the points to leave Villa’s Dean Smith cutting a disconsolate figure at full-time. “Disappointed is an understatement,” he said. “We’ve made a big mistake for their first goal and we are getting punished massively for that at the moment. It was a tough last 15 minutes.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/09/leicester-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Johnson's coronavirus press conference is anything but reassuring | John Crace

<p>Flanking himself with experts wasn’t enough to make an uneasy PM look on top of the crisis</p><p>There may come a time when an emergency press conference actually reassures someone, but we’re a long way off as yet. Quite the reverse, in fact. When Boris Johnson had lined up with the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/03/boris-fails-to-convince-with-sanitised-take-on-coronavirus">at Downing Street last Tuesday</a> the mood had been notably more relaxed. Though Boris had tried to look serious when doing his familiar front-of-house “business as usual” act, he’d still found time for a few light-hearted gaffes and gags. And Whitty and Vallance had appeared to be thoroughly enjoying their unexpected turn in the spotlight as the country’s favourite experts.</p><p>A week on, and the three amigos were back in the same state room at No 10. But this time there were no smiles and even fewer words of reassurance. Even the hitherto imperturbable Whitty looked flushed and sweaty as he tried to choose his words carefully, while Boris appeared to have aged years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/johnsons-coronavirus-press-conference-is-anything-but-reassuring">Continue reading...</a>

## Marcelo Bielsa: a method actor in football's theatre of the absurd | Jonathan Liew

<p>Leeds are homing in on a Premier League return, and it is hard to know just what the top flight will make of their unique and brilliant manager</p><p><em>It’s happening</em>. Mateusz Klich plays a delicious back-heel to Pablo Hernández.<em> It’s definitely happening.</em> Hernández plays a first-time pass into the space that will shortly be occupied by Jack Harrison. <em>This is not a drill.</em> Harrison takes a look, doesn’t like what he sees, takes a touch, takes another look, crosses. The cross is deep, sailing over a sea of bobbing heads to the far post where Luke Ayling, having sprinted 60 yards from right-back, calmly smashes a volley into the roof of the net. You know, as you do. <em>It’s happening.</em> At this exact moment, the only able-bodied person at Elland Road not on their feet is Marcelo Bielsa. While his substitutes and coaching staff storm the pitch, while grown men scream “WHAT A GOAL! WHAT A GOAL!”, Bielsa remains perched on his bucket, takes a slow, measured sip of his coffee, as blank and expressionless as if this were a film he’s seen before.</p><p>In a way, he has. A few hours after Leeds had beaten Huddersfield 2-0 on Saturday, the club’s social media people put out a video of a recent training session at Thorp Arch, in which Ayling scores a near-perfect replica of that volleyed goal. Perhaps this is the curse of the obsessive: once you’ve seen all the tapes, logged every data point, mapped out every possible occurrence, reality itself must seem like a replay of something that everyone else is watching for the first time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/09/marcelo-bielsa-a-method-actor-in-footballs-theatre-of-the-absurd">Continue reading...</a>

Our businesses and our communities cannot cope with any more uncertainty during this outbreak<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak" title="">Coronavirus</a> is a threat to the global economy as well as to public health. Every family will be affected and those who have less will feel it the most. In a globally connected world, we are only as strong as the most vulnerable. The government must take a long-term approach to this crisis and run the country like the future matters. In a crisis, uncertainty must be minimised. That is the lesson from the financial crisis in 2008 and every global crisis before it.</p><p>So first, we must agree with the EU to extend the Brexit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/14/eu-brexit-transition-period-boris-johnson" title="">transition period</a>. Our businesses and our communities cannot cope with more uncertainty during this outbreak. British companies who trade with the EU do not know what terms they’ll be trading on in 10 months’ time. Add to this the falling demand and disruption created by coronavirus and it is reasonable to expect many businesses will not survive. The government has boxed itself into a corner by legislating to end the transition period in December come what may. It now faces a direct choice between narrow partisan ideology and the interests of the nation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-government-extend-brexit-transition-period">Continue reading...</a>

Since the coronavirus crisis gripped the markets, the FTSE 100 has fallen from around 7,400 to 6,000, a drop of 19%. So you can expect that the total value of your pension pot is down by about 9% to 11% so far.</p><p><strong>I’m in the government’s auto-enrolment pension scheme. How’s that coping?<br /></strong>There are now 8.5 million British workers automatically enrolled into the Nest workplace pension scheme. The good news is that its main fund is only 52% invested in shares, with much of the rest of the money in government and corporate bonds, some of which have been going up in value during the crisis. Nest, in common with other pension providers, does not give daily updates on pricing, but said that for the period from the start of 2020 to 6 March, the fund was down by 4%. After today’s market fall, that figure will be looking worse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/09/how-will-the-stock-market-fall-affect-my-personal-finances">Continue reading...</a>

## Max von Sydow: an aristocrat of cinema who made me weep | Peter Bradshaw

<p>From his fateful game of chess to a moving turn in The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, Von Sydow was the last standard bearer of Bergman’s high-minded movie idiom</p><p>•<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/max-von-sydow-star-of-the-exorcist-and-the-seventh-seal-dies-aged-90">Max von Sydow dies aged 90</a><br />•<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/mar/09/the-seventh-seal-to-the-exorcist-max-von-sydow-a-life-in-pictures">A life in pictures</a></p><p>The opening of the seventh seal in the Book of Revelation, disclosing the truth of God’s existence and the second coming, will result in a mysterious silence in the kingdom of heaven – then the sound of trumpets and the thunderous uproar of Earth’s apocalyptic ending. In the movies, no actor has ever represented these ideas more seriously, nor shown humanity’s anguish in the face of God’s implacable silence or unassuageable anger more clearly, than Max von Sydow. He was virtually a book of revelation in himself.</p><p>The passionate severity of Von Sydow – and his ability to impersonate the ascetic nobility of some impossibly remote priestly or knightly order but with very human flaws – formed the bedrock of Ingmar Bergman’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/1958/mar/08/world.mainsection">The Seventh Seal</a> and the staggering series of films he was to make with Bergman in the 1950s and 1960s. Beyond that, he virtually epitomised an entire, distinctively high-minded attitude to cinematic art in Europe. His films for Bergman were composed in a movie idiom that drew on Ibsen and Strindberg, Sjöström and Dreyer – and of which, since Bergman’s death in 2007, Von Sydow could be said to be the final standard bearer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/max-von-sydow-an-aristocrat-of-cinema-who-made-me-weep">Continue reading...</a>

Apparently, breeds that produce brown eggs are typically more aggressive to one another, so they are debeaked via an infrared amputation process that is thought to be very painful. White hens, by contrast, are quite civil, so there is less cruelty involved in the intensive harvesting of their issue.</p><p>It feels a tiny bit as though farmers are repackaging their cruel beak-ectomies as the consumer’s responsibility. It also, at the risk of being overemotional, sounds as though aggressiveness may not be innate to the brown-egg layers. It could just be the conditions they have to live in, on a busy production line, that may make them aggressive to the point of homicide and (apparently) cannibalism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2020/mar/09/beak-trimming-and-brutality-is-it-time-to-stop-buying-brown-eggs">Continue reading...</a>

I however already have a hefty equity of around £210,000. The property is worth around £330,000.</p><p>When he moves in I am going to put him on to the mortgage and then we will immediately re-mortgage to pay for home improvements of around £70,000.

## Recollections of My Non-Existence by Rebecca Solnit review – figuring out what stories to tell
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/09/recollections-of-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/09/recollections-of-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review)

The influential American writer’s memoir is less about soul-baring than the story of men’s attempts to silence women<p>There was a time when Rebecca Solnit was a kind of underground secret, like a cult band you had to seek out in obscure venues and only the cognoscenti knew about; hearing her writing mentioned by a new acquaintance meant you knew you’d found a soulmate. I first encountered her through her 2000 book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/wanderlust-9781783780396.html" title=""><em>Wanderlust: A History of Walking</em></a>, and her work reminded me of essayists of the 1960s and 70s such as Susan Sontag and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/joan-didion" title="">Joan Didion</a>, who wove together personal experience, academic research, cultural history and pop culture into a new kind of nonfiction that seemed energetic and flexible enough to encompass any subject and offer new ways of seeing it. Solnit reached greater prominence with the essays <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2005/jul/03/politics" title=""><em>Hope </em><em>in </em><em>the Dark</em></a>, written in 2003 at the start of the Iraq war, which became a manifesto against political despair, but it was her 2008 piece Men Explain Things to Me that catapulted her into the mainstream, gave rise to the term “mansplaining” (which entered the Oxford English Dictionary in 2014, though the neologism was not hers), made her an idol to a generation of young women and turned her into one of the US’s leading cultural and political commentators.</p><p><em>Recollections </em><em>of My Non-Existence</em> is Solnit’s account of her formation as a writer, from her arrival in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/30/public-matters-photography-janet-delaney-san-francisco-interview" title="">San Francisco</a> in 1981 as a student, through the various shifts in her career as she discovers the themes that move her. Anyone hoping that this book, which is billed as a memoir, will offer a more intimate glimpse of the writer, might be disappointed in that regard; Solnit does not go in for soul-baring, and even in this personal history she keeps her gaze focused outward, on what her particular encounters can tell us about the prevailing culture of publishing, or the art world, or the environmental movement, or the city at the time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/09/recollections-of-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review">Continue reading...</a>

Friends loved hearing about my inability to find a partner but I realised that spilling all perpetuated this narrative. Not talking about my love life has been empowering<p>Some people see being single as an active, positive choice, but for several years that wasn’t my experience. I railed against it, resenting the fact that I was alone. I had dated a lot, but why couldn’t I find the right man? Why had someone I really liked rejected me? Why did all my friends have husbands or boyfriends and kids, while I spent ages lurching from lust to loneliness and back again? It didn’t seem fair.</p><p>Each time I had a bad experience, or a good one, I had a tendency to tell all my female friends, providing endless information about the man who said I was awesome but kept cancelling, the date whose dog was more interested in me than he was, or the bloke I knew as a teenager with whom my mother set me up as an adult (predictably, a disaster).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/09/i-shared-stories-of-my-disastrous-dates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As she hits the stage in a powerful solo show, the frenetic star talks about sexist miners, over-friendly horses – and what really happened at that No 10 drinks party</p><p>Speaking breathlessly between sips of tea, Su Pollard is talking about her stage debut, which took place at the age of six. She was playing one of the Angel Gabriel’s sidekicks in a nativity play and, for some reason, had been made to stand on a cardboard box. “I was telling Mary, ‘Fear not! Angel Gabriel will –’ And then I disappeared into the box. The teacher hadn’t made it strong enough.”</p><p>Little Su, demonstrating the professionalism that would come to define her career, climbed out and finished her line: “– be coming to give you a sign.” As the audience howled in delight, she realised that it was her destiny to make people laugh. Or at least so she says, with the advantage of hindsight. There is something very <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/apr/05/how-we-made-chumbawumba-tubthumping">Chumbawamba</a> about Pollard: the woman best known for playing Peggy, the chalet cleaner in the BBC sitcom <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6j3nnn">Hi-de-Hi!</a>, keeps getting knocked down, but she gets up again.

<p>From ill health to alcoholism to suicides, the links between deprivation and reduced life expectancy are becoming clear</p><p>On the face of it, it is a familiar enough story. “By its end, much of the optimism of the 20th century had faded. Towns and cities … that used to produce steel, glass, furniture or shoes, and that are fondly remembered by people in their 70s as having been great places to grow up, had been gutted, their factories closed and shops boarded up.”</p><p>The words are taken from a remarkable new book by the academics Anne Case and Angus Deaton. On the face of it, this passage perhaps suggests one of those cliched accounts of what sits behind the growth of populism. But rather than framing the condition we now know as “left behind” as a matter of political preferences, the cheerily titled Deaths of Despair and the Future of Capitalism sees it in terms of stark matters such as illness, addiction and <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/112/49/15078.long" title="">rising mortality rates among white Americans</a> aged between 45 and 54, which the book links to “suicides, drug overdoses and alcoholic liver disease”. Between 2014 and 2017, these factors contributed to the first decline in average American life expectancy since records began in 1933.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/09/social-crisis-inequality-life-and-death">Continue reading...</a>
