Since the coronavirus crisis gripped the markets, the FTSE 100 has fallen from around 7,400 to 6,000, a drop of 19%. So you can expect that the total value of your pension pot is down by about 9% to 11% so far.</p><p><strong>I\u2019m in the government\u2019s auto-enrolment pension scheme. How\u2019s that coping?<br /></strong>There are now 8.5 million British workers automatically enrolled into the Nest workplace pension scheme. The good news is that its main fund is only 52% invested in shares, with much of the rest of the money in government and corporate bonds, some of which have been going up in value during the crisis. Nest, in common with other pension providers, does not give daily updates on pricing, but said that for the period from the start of 2020 to 6 March, the fund was down by 4%.

I first encountered her through her 2000 book <a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wanderlust-9781783780396.html\" title=\"\"><em>Wanderlust: A History of Walking</em></a>, and her work reminded me of essayists of the 1960s and 70s such as Susan Sontag and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/joan-didion\" title=\"\">Joan Didion</a>, who wove together personal experience, academic research, cultural history and pop culture into a new kind of nonfiction that seemed energetic and flexible enough to encompass any subject and offer new ways of seeing it.

Anyone hoping that this book, which is billed as a memoir, will offer a more intimate glimpse of the writer, might be disappointed in that regard; Solnit does not go in for soul-baring, and even in this personal history she keeps her gaze focused outward, on what her particular encounters can tell us about the prevailing culture of publishing, or the art world, or the environmental movement, or the city at the time.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/09/recollections-of-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/09/recollections-of-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review", "date_published": "2020-03-09 07:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Rose and Rosie: how video games play a role in our marriage", "description": "<p>YouTubers Rose and Rosie had very different experiences of games growing up \u2013 then they fell in love.
