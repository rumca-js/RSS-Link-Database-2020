Warzone's release date is March 10 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Here's what's different about the free-to-play standalone Call of Duty game, including contracts, respawns, and 1v1 battles.

Call of Duty: Warzone is a standalone, upgraded version of Black Ops 4's Blackout mode. Its Battle Royale mode is very similar, where players compete to be the last person standing, but this version supports 150 players in squads or solos. Warzone also features Plunder, where the goal is to earn the most money via looting, eliminating other players, and completing new objectives called Contracts.

Warzone is free-to-play, and you can download it even if you don't already own Modern Warfare. However, if you do own the most recent Call of Duty game, your Battle Pass items, Operators, and progression will transfer over to Warzone. The inverse is also possible: if you download Warzone and decide to pick up Modern Warfare later, your progress will transfer too.

Call of Duty: Warzone's release date is March 10 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Activision will be setting the game live at 12 PM PDT. Modern Warfare owners can jump in earlier by downloading the Warzone update; that will go live at 8 AM PDT.

In 1987 a secret move was uncovered at the arcades, and its impact is still being felt today. Join Kurt Indovina on his journey to discover its origins through fireball legend John Choi, commentator Stephen "Sajam" Lyon, and many more special guests in the first episode of Remember When.

The history of video games is replete with fascinating cultural events, captivating stories, and landmark moments. More often than not, each of these creates a ripple effect that redefines how we play, or reshapes what we play. Those with a keen interest in video games are no doubt familiar with the whos, whats, and whens of it all, given their historic significance, but the personal perspectives tied to them can be lost to time, if heard at all.

Remember When is a new GameSpot show about rediscovering those landmark moments in video games and exploring their histories, but also delving into the impact they had on the people that were there and experienced them. 

The first episode is focused on the Hadouken, a secret move that has become fundamental to the design of games within the genre. Equally important, however, is how it galvanized a passionate gaming community that lives on today, stronger and more connected than ever. 

The Hadouken became a cultural touchstone, and for the guests featured in the episode, had a hand in defining their real-lives in meaningful ways. Joining host Kurt Indovina are special guests John Choi, a legendary Street Fighter player known for his mastery of the fireball; commentator Sajam, who has witnessed the Hadouken's  evolution over the generations; and various members of the GameSpot and Giant Bomb team, who have in one way or another been profoundly impacted by Street Fighter and its most iconic special move. 

Watch the premiere episode of Remember When above, and look out for new episodes on GameSpot's YouTube channel.
