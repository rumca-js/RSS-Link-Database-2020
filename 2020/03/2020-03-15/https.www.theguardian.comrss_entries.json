The launch was attended by Lulu Xingwana, minister for arts and culture at the time, who had been invited to officially open the show. But instead of giving a speech, Xingwana stormed out of the gallery after seeing images by the photographer <a href=\"https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/zanele-muholi\" title=\"\">Zanele Muholi </a>that depicted naked women in close embrace. Muholi\u2019s work, said the minister, was immoral, offensive and ran contrary to \u201csocial cohesion and nation-building\u201d. South Africa has one of the most progressive constitutions in the world, with discrimination on the basis of sexuality barred by law. Yet censorious attitudes such as Xingwana\u2019s towards homosexuality are widespread. Almost three-quarters of the population believe same-sex sexual activity is morally wrong, according to a 2016 survey. Similarly intolerant views are commonplace across Africa.

It is punishable by life imprisonment in Uganda, Tanzania and Sierra Leone. In Sudan, southern Somalia, Somaliland, Mauritania and northern Nigeria, the penalty is death. Against that backdrop the work of a photographer such as Muholi takes on a dual role, both representing individual artistic expression and operating as a form of political activism; a means to positively assert LGBTQ+ identity in straitened circumstances.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/15/africa-state-of-mind-extract-ekow-eshun\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/15/africa-state-of-mind-extract-ekow-eshun", "date_published": "2020-03-15 14:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Genesis P-Orridge: troubling catalyst who loathed rock yet changed it for ever", "description": "<p>With Throbbing Gristle, P-Orridge inadvertently helped invent an entire genre \u2013 industrial music</p><p>For someone who occasionally purported to hate rock music \u2013 it was, a homemade T-shirt s/he was fond of wearing in the 1970s proclaimed, \u201cfor arselickers\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/genesis-p-orridge\">Genesis Breyer P-Orridge</a> ended up having a vast influence on it.
