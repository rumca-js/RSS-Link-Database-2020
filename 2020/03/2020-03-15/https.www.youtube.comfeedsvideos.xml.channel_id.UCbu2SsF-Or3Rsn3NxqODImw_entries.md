E3 2020 is officially canceled due to coronavirus concerns. In lieu of a traditional convention, many publishers are exploring other ways to deliver their news and provide a look at the games on the way.

Microsoft, which owns the Microsoft Theater next to the convention center where E3 is held each year, will host an "Xbox digital event." Details about the event and what we can expect to see will be announced in the coming weeks.

Nintendo has responded with support for the ESA's decision to cancel the show. While Nintendo has occupied floor space at E3 in years past, it has forgone the traditional press conference for a Nintendo Direct. Another livestream will likely air this year.

Other publishers have reacted to the cancelation, including Ubisoft and THQ Nordic. Stay tuned to GameSpot as more companies reveal their plans.
