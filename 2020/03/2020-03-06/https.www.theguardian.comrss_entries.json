Traditionally you\u2019d look to the country for oak, applied with varying degrees of finesse, or, more recently, for wines that were big, powerful and not shy with the alcohol. But, as a recent event in London aimed to show, Spanish wine has become so much more varied and, yes, elegant in the past decade or so. As the name of the event, Vi\u00f1ateros (which is the Spanish for vigneron or winegrower), meant to suggest, this is a development led by small producers, often working in out-of-the-way places and with long-neglected vineyards, such as those found in the Gredos mountains near Madrid. This part of Spain has become known for its fascinatingly pale, herby pinot noir-like garnacha red wines, but such richly satisfying, yet nervy and textured whites as Fernando Garcia\u2019s Picarana are pretty special too.</p><p><strong>Ver\u00f3nica Ortega Cobrana, Bierzo, Spain 2017 (\u00a324.28, <a href=\"https://www.vinetrail.co.uk/\">Vine Trail</a>)</strong> For a taste of that wild, pale and interesting Gredos garnacha, names to look out for include Daniel Landi and his Commando G project and 4 Monos. But Gredos most certainly doesn\u2019t have the monopoly on haunting reds. In the northwest of the country, the menc\u00eda variety is responsible for some wonderfully evocative wines. Among the most captivating wines at the Vi\u00f1ateros event was Veronica Ortega\u2019s blend of mostly menc\u00eda with a handful of local white grape varieties from a very old (90-year-old) vineyard in the cool high up (750m) in Bierzo: so pretty in its violet-petal and red berry aromas, and so graceful with its feathery tannins and fresh Atlantic breeziness. There was elegance, too, from the margins of Spain\u2019s most famous region, Rioja, not least in the fabulously silky, pure-fruited, quietly powerful Bodega Lanzaga 2014 (\u00a319.35, <a href=\"https://www.winebuyers.com/\">Wine Buyers</a>) from one of the original leading lights of modern Spanish wine, Telmo Rodr\u00edguez.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/06/spains-elegant-new-wave-the-varied-haunting-fascinating-new-spanish-wines\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/06/spains-elegant-new-wave-the-varied-haunting-fascinating-new-spanish-wines", "date_published": "2020-03-06 06:00:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Why we need worst-case thinking to prevent pandemics", "description": "<p>Threats to humanity, and how we address them, define our time. Why are we still so complacent about facing up to existential risk? By Toby Ord</p><p>The world is in the early stages of what may be the most deadly pandemic of the past 100 years. In China, thousands of people have already died; large outbreaks have begun in South Korea, Iran and Italy; and the rest of the world is bracing for impact. We do not yet know whether the final toll will be measured in thousands or hundreds of thousands. For all our advances in medicine, humanity remains much more vulnerable to pandemics than we would like to believe.</p><p>To understand our vulnerability, and to determine what steps must be taken to end it, it is useful to ask about the very worst-case scenarios. Just how bad could a pandemic be? In science fiction, we sometimes encounter the idea of a pandemic so severe that it could cause the end of civilisation, or even of humanity itself. Such a risk to humanity\u2019s entire future is known as an existential risk. We can say with certainty that the novel coronavirus, named Covid-19, does not pose such a risk. But could the next pandemic?
