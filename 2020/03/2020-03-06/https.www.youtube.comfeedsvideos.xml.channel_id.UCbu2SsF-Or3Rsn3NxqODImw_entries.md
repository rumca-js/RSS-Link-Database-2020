Let the hype commence! Bungie revealed more information on Destiny 2's upcoming season alongside an electric gameplay trailer. Here's everything you need to know about the story so far, and what you can look forward to.

Destiny 2 continues its rollout of new content with the Season of the Worthy on March 10, with new story elements, new activities, and new loot. Bungie has finally laid out some of the details about what we can expect from the new season, including the return of Destiny's greatest PvP challenge, the Trials of Osiris. Check out the video above for a full rundown--there's a lot of ground to cover.

Trials is the biggest element of the new season. The weekend event offers some of Destiny 2's greatest, toughest-to-earn rewards, but only if you manage to go through several rounds of competitive play undefeated. Trials has been out of the game since way back in 2018, so its return is a big deal to some of the most dedicated in the Destiny 2 fanbase.

If you're more of a PvE player, though, there's plenty for you as well. The Season of the Worthy is all about working with Rasputin, the giant AI that was central to the Warmind expansion, and the new Seraph Tower activity is all about working with other players to power up the computer so it can defend the solar system. Those are covered on the season's content roadmap. We also know you'll be chasing The 4th Horseman, an Exotic shotgun from the first Destiny, which appeared in the season's trailer.

There are a whole lot more details for the Season of the Worthy in the video above--but don't be surprised if Bungie slips in a few secrets it hasn't placed on the roadmap, as well.

We explore the Kwolok's Hollow, solve some puzzles, and take on a boss in Ori And The Will Of The Wisps for Xbox One and PC. 

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the follow-up to one of the most acclaimed Xbox One titles of this generation, Ori and the Blind Forest. Once again developed by Moon Studios, the sequel aims to take the challenging Metroidvania-style gameplay of the first game and expand on it. The sequel features new movement abilities and, thanks to a variety of new weapons, expanded combat.

Of course, what people really responded to in the first game is the beautiful art style and world. It also had a surprisingly emotional story thanks to its wonderfully animated characters and heartfelt soundtrack. Naturally, expectations for the second game are very high and although we'll have to wait for the game's launch to see whether it lives up to them. However, we do have a sample of gameplay from Ori and the Will of the Wisps to give you an early indication of how it's shaping up. 

In the video above we head to Kwolok's Hollow and do some exploration, battling enemies and solving puzzles along the way. The video culminates in a boss battle and, as a whole, should give you a good taster of the gameplay experience.  

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is set for release on Xbox One and PC on March 11.

For the final episode of our competitive Pokemon Sword and Shield mini-series, Kallie dives into Pokemon breeding and EV training.

Even if you've played every Pokemon game, there's a good chance you've never played it competitively. That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding, making it a worthwhile pursuit, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.

For the final episode of our guide to Competitive Pokemon, Kallie dives into Pokemon breeding and EV training. This video will teach you how to efficiently breed the perfect Pokemon, teach it the right moves, and EV train it. 

In GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, "In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place. You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch."

The Ghost of Tsushima release date is June 26. Here's everything we know so far about Sucker Punch's next PS4 exclusive.

Sucker Punch has announced the Ghost of Tsushima release date, alongside a new story trailer. The samurai game is set on the real-world Tsushima Island, which was invaded by the Mongol Empire in 1274. Samurai Jin Sakai leads a rebellion against the occupying Mongol horde after its successful invasion of the island.

Ghost of Tsushima isn't entirely violent though. Sucker Punch studio head Chris Zimmerman explained to us that Tsushima's natural beauty will be a big part of the game. Of course, as you ride your horse over rolling hills and dense forests, you will have to stop to duel Mongol soldiers.

In addition to the launch date and story trailer, Sucker Punch announced several editions of the game, detailed in our pre-order guide. These include a variety of digital and physical bonuses.
