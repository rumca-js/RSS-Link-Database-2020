While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!\nWatch Sarah Siskind\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2009: https://www.npr.org/2009/07/27/106990375/sarah-siskind-tiny-desk-concert\n\nFollow NPR Music:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\nStephen Thompson | July 27, 2009 \n\nLike many of Sarah Siskind's fans, I'd never heard of her until Bon Iver started covering her song \"Lovin's for Fools\" at its shows \u2014 sometimes with the band Bowerbirds, sometimes on its own and sometimes with Siskind herself singing along. Like a few other Siskind devotees, Bob Boilen had never heard of the Nashville singer-songwriter until her album Say It Louder showed up on his desk a few months ago; when he put it on, he was instantly smitten with the song \"Falling Stars,\" which he played on All Songs Considered.\n\nIf you've never heard of Sarah Siskind, click the video link on this page, and you're likely to praise her as effusively as Bob and I do at every opportunity. It's no faint praise to suggest that Bon Iver's version of \"Lovin's for Fools\" can't quite live up to Siskind's original: Hers is so wrenching, so infused with wounded grace, that it's essentially untouchable. Her strong but vulnerable voice, her impeccable phrasing and her gently masterful guitar work make her an underexposed treasure.\n\nIn this charming Tiny Desk concert, Siskind performs two of the highlights from Say It Louder \u2014 \"Falling Stars\" and the title track \u2014 before closing with a requested \"Lovin's for Fools.\" Each song finds her concocting a heady cocktail of tender beauty and winsome regret, while employing a voice that's at once honeyed and raw.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6X1uocXxyQo", "date_published": "2020-03-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Cimafunk: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Watch Cimafunk play \"Alabao\", \"Cocinarte\" and \"Me Voy\" at the Tiny Desk.\n\nDid you know you can watch new Tiny Desk concerts on npr.org ONE WEEK before they go up on YouTube?

I couldn't wait to get them behind the Tiny Desk so the band could strut its intoxicating mix of Afro-Cuban dance music and 1970s funk-and-soul from the US.\n\nFrom the moment Cimafunk and his band start their feathery intro to \"Alabao,\" it's clear that something different is about to go down. Lead vocalist Cimafunk (Erik Rodr\u00edguez) has mastered the mash-up of Cuban soneos (vocal improvisations) and deep, soul-singing over music that I swear could have been played by any of the funk bands I saw back in the '70s.\n\nWith a sound that would feel right at home in either the famed Apollo Theater or the hottest dance clubs of Havana, this young Afro-Cuban and crew take it to a whole different level. For example, the very traditional guajira piano riff on \"Cocinarte\" transitions to a James Brown-styled funk groove so easily, it sounds like they were made from the same root. (They are, but that is another story.)\n\nThe band breaks things down into the funkiest of bolero-swing only to have it explode into another funk romp, powered by lead singer Cimafunk's reimagining of 1960s soul singer Otis Redding and Cuban icon Benny Mor\u00e9.\n\nI've seen the band in Austin, Washington, D.C. and even on their home base in Havana, Cuba and every time, their tune \"Me Voy\" raises the roof and wakes the dead, with a deep Afro-Cuban, funk-party groove. This time, they turned the Tiny Desk into the hippest Cuban dance spot on the East Coast.\n\nThe band is making converts every time they play for new fans and you'll see why in this video. It catches them doing what they do best: combining two propulsive dance and musical traditions into one, singular musical vision.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Alabao\"\n\"Cocinarte\"\n\"Me Voy\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nCimafunk: vocals; Diego Barrera Hernandez \" Bejuko\": guitar; Miguel Piquero Villavicencio \"Miguelo\": vocals, percussion; Juan Marcos Rodr\u00edguez Faedo \" Firulais \" keys; Raul Zapata Sur\u00ed \"Dr. Zapa\" : drums; Mario Gabriel Mesa Meri\u00f1o \"Machete\": percussion; Ibanez Hermida Marrero \"Caramelo\": bass; Ilarivis Garcia Despaigne \"Hilaria Cacao\": vocals, trombone\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Felix Contreras, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, Patrick Boyd; Editor: Melany Rochester; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Bronson Arcuri, Kara Frame, Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Laura Beltran Villamizar/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auy9DFC2eOE", "date_published": "2020-03-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
