## Coronavirus could turn Joe Biden’s defining weakness into a strength | Jonathan Freedland

<p>Suddenly being the experienced Washington insider who was number two to Obama could be more of an asset than a liability</p><p>Joe Biden is a candidate whose performance on the stump ranges from badly flawed to awful. He is a meandering, unfocused speaker, often unable to complete a sentence, let alone a thought, with a record in office that is decidedly patchy, marred by several past positions he struggles to defend. And yet Biden is now the frontrunner for his party’s nomination to take on Donald Trump. What’s more, the current mood, and specifically the threat of coronavirus, might just turn his defining weakness into a strength – and give him a serious shot at the White House.</p><p>I saw his limitations for myself last month in Hudson, New Hampshire, as he paced around a high school gymnasium delivering a rambling monologue that suggested a politician well past his prime. Stronger on autobiography than policy, he strung together childhood memories, mottos taught him by his father and a kind of perplexed outrage that Trump’s America was not a country he recognised any more: “What’s this all about?” he asked, as if befuddled. “What do we stand for?” In New Hampshire, he finished fifth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-joe-biden-epidemic-washington-obama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The upsetting case of Errol Graham, who starved to death after his benefits were stopped, has highlighted grave errors</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/27/errol-graham-man-starved-death-benefits-cut-letter-welfare-officials" title="">handwritten letter</a> to welfare officials found in the flat of Errol Graham, the Nottingham man who starved to death after his benefits were stopped in 2018, is completely free of the rancour one might expect from a person in his position. Instead, the message, published in the Guardian last week, was a dignified attempt to explain why he needed support. “Sometimes I can’t stand to even hear the washing machine, and I wish I knew why,” Mr Graham wrote. “I think I feel more secure on my own in my own company, but I wish it wasn’t like that.”</p><p>Mr Graham was known by the Department for Work and Pensions to have severe mental health problems. But in October 2017 his social security payments <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/28/disabled-man-starved-to-death-after-dwp-stopped-his-benefits" title="">were cut off</a> after he failed to attend a fit-for-work test. When his body was found by bailiffs, he weighed four and a half stone. The decision to cut off Mr Graham’s payments, and the way this decision was taken – without notifying his GP, family members, landlord, or social services – are the subject of legal action against the DWP by his relatives. But while the details of the case are shocking, and shaming, what is even more disturbing is that these events were not the result of human error, or DWP malfunction. On the contrary, an official told last year’s inquest into Mr Graham’s death that the department’s guidelines were correctly followed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/06/the-guardian-view-on-the-dwp-failing-the-vulnerable">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor plays a justice-seeking ex-cop in a clumsy, unfunny adaptation of a much-loved literary crime series</p><p>Mark Wahlberg’s first film for Netflix, a charmless little shrug of a caper called Spenser Confidential, is the kind of film that evaporates as it’s being watched, destined never to be thought of again. It’s regrettable given those involved, from director Peter Berg, who has worked with Wahlberg four times before, including on 2016’s criminally underseen Deepwater Horizon, to writer Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar for his LA Confidential script before getting nominated for Mystic River. It’s also a story based around a much-loved private eye created by Robert B Parker, one who provided inspiration to crime authors such as Dennis Lehane and Harlan Coben. But it would take a master sleuth to detect any of that pedigree in the finished product.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/28/all-the-bright-places-review-netflix">All the Bright Places review – teen charm can't lift maudlin Netflix drama</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/06/spenser-confidential-review-mark-wahlberg-netflix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sympathy for Spurs player’s action reflects an age where anonymised abuse isn’t just aimed at sporting celebrities</p><p>‘Where can there be a place in the game for a man of such extravagant talent, a man of such wicked temperament? A man who has now … OH MY GOODNESS ME!!! He has KICKED … He has PUNCHED A FAN!!! Eric Cantona has jumped in and SCISSOR KUNG FU KICKED a fan. I have never seen such a disgraceful incident in all my years in football. Cantona must be thrown out of the game. I care not one jot about his supreme talent!!”</p><p>The words of the young firebrand Jonathan Pearce there. Pearce was commentating on the radio as Cantona <em>scissor kung</em><em> fu kicked</em> – excellent football-style technique descriptor there – an abusive supporter at Selhurst Park in January 1995. In the process he captured perfectly the mind-boggling weirdness of a moment where modern football became, ahead of time, a truly interactive entertainment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/mar/06/eric-dier-trip-through-fourth-wall-oddly-moving-act-defiance-spurs">Continue reading...</a>

After a huge project that involved picking over tens of thousands of example sentences, Oxford University Press (OUP) has been quietly replacing hundreds of those that “unnecessarily perpetuate sexist stereotypes” in Oxford Dictionaries, the dictionary source licensed by Apple and Google.

Rotterdam is big, alive, city-ish, but the big skies of the vast harbour and copious parks make it breathable. And for those still in mourning, Rotterdam is gloriously EUropean. It’s even hosting the <a href="https://eurovision.tv/event/rotterdam-2020" title="">Eurovision Song Contest</a> in May.

<p>That’s all people talk about now and I’ve never seen such frantic hand washing in Westminster</p><p>Fiona Bruce has told the Radio Times she has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/fiona-bruce-surprised-at-question-times-level-of-toxicity">surprised by the toxicity</a> of the Question Time debates. So I can only assume she had never watched the programme when she agreed to take over the presenter’s role from David Dimbleby. For some years now – not helped by Brexit which still continues to divide the country no matter how much we are told that now is the time for everyone to come together – Question Time has been a bit of a bear-pit with panels, composed of politicians and professional gobshites, and audiences selected for their capacity to kick lumps out of one another. All of which I am sure is entirely deliberate as it’s the rows that pull in the ratings. QT’s prime aim is to attract viewers and get people mouthing off on Twitter, not stimulate intelligent debate. If anyone ends the hour any better informed, then it’s just an added bonus. A politician not abjectly defending a party line, or a business person or pundit making a nuanced argument are the exception. I’ve never been invited to take part in the programme, but even if I were to be I would turn it down. Partly because I wouldn’t want the stress of being in such a pressured situation – my anxiety levels are bad enough on the occasions I punish myself by watching it on TV – but mainly because there are many topics on which I either don’t have a particularly strong opinion or don’t feel sufficiently well-informed to start sounding off. Somehow, I suspect, the producers would be tearing their hair out at a guest whose main contribution was to say, “It’s complicated” or “I don’t really know”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/06/despite-the-experts-back-in-charge-im-having-coronavirus-anxiety-dreams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the four-hour series Hillary, hours of interviews are coupled with behind-the-scenes footage for a look at the woman behind the divisive persona</p><p>It’s difficult, maybe impossible, to get a clear assessment on the life of Hillary Clinton. Her status as one of America’s most visible political figures has been so polarizing, her controversies so tirelessly hashed out, her “likability” so exhaustingly assessed, that there doesn’t seem to be much room for another reframing. But Hillary, the four-hour docu-series on Hulu, seeks to take a cool-headed look at her life and career, to revisit past scandals with candor and unpack her divisive persona with unprecedented access to Clinton and those close to her. As first lady, senator from New York, secretary of state and the first female presidential candidate for a major party, Clinton has been revered and reviled, decried as too radical and not radical enough, heralded as a feminist trailblazer and loathed as an emblem of the Democratic establishment.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/06/zodiac-killer-the-most-dangerous-man-of-all">The Zodiac Killer has been a mystery for 50 years –&nbsp;but one man thinks he's solved it</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/06/hillary-clinton-revealing-docuseries-hulu">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From parenting to a broken dishwasher, it’s often enough just to stop, and look, and wait</p><p>The other day, I fixed a problem with the way our dishwasher connects to the water supply. I’m sharing this story partly because the news headlines are often extremely alarming at the moment, and I thought my stupefyingly boring anecdote might numb you into a few moments of calm. (You’re welcome!) But it also demonstrates the wisdom of an insight I first learned from the psychiatrist M Scott Peck’s classic self-help book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-road-less-travelled-9780712661157.html" title="">The Road Less Travelled</a>: sometimes, all you need to do in order to fix things – in your kitchen, in your life – is to stop, and look, and wait.</p><p>Peck recalls chatting with a neighbour who was in the process of repairing his lawnmower, and mentioned his own ineptitude at such practical tasks. “That’s because you don’t take the time,” the neighbour shot back – a comment that gnawed at Peck and resurfaced a few weeks later when the parking brake on a patient’s car got stuck. Normally, he writes, “I would have awkwardly stuck my head under the dashboard; immediately yanked at a few wires without having the foggiest idea of what I was doing, and when nothing constructive resulted, would have thrown up my hands and proclaimed, ‘It’s beyond me!’” Instead, he lay down, got comfortable and looked for several minutes until he could trace the course of the brake apparatus. Finally he noticed a tiny latch that was jammed, and needed only a fingertip’s pressure to release it. Voilà! It wasn’t that the problem had been especially difficult; it was just that it couldn’t be rushed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/06/some-life-problems-arent-especially-hard-to-fix-as-long-as-theyre-not-rushed">Continue reading...</a>

The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu.

<p>I am still being lazy and ignorant, but this time it’s for a reason</p><p>This summer I will be visiting Portugal for the fifth year in a row, which is either a huge compliment to the country’s hospitality or a true illustration of the rut into which the Ranganathans have descended. We even go so far as to stay in exactly the same place every time, considering it adventurous to pop to a beach we haven’t been to before.</p><p>The reasons for this are mainly to do with how great Portugal is: it has sunshine and beautiful beaches and lovely food and welcoming locals, like many holiday destinations, but without wanting to sound like one of those wankers who’s just been travelling, we just like the vibe. I also love familiarity. I like turning up to the house and knowing whose room is whose. I know that we unpack quickly and head to the local supermarket to stock up. I know that I text my mum to let her know we’ve arrived safely, and she replies telling me to remember that children go missing there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/06/not-learning-portuguese-romesh-ranganathan-this-is-europe">Continue reading...</a>

## Spain’s elegant new wave

<p>Small independent growers are now producing varied, haunting, even fascinating wines</p><p><strong>Bodega Marañones Picarana, Vinos de Madrid, Spain 2018 (£21, <a href="https://www.woodwinters.com/">Woodwinters</a>) </strong>Spain hasn’t always been the first port of call for lovers of elegance in wine. Traditionally you’d look to the country for oak, applied with varying degrees of finesse, or, more recently, for wines that were big, powerful and not shy with the alcohol. But, as a recent event in London aimed to show, Spanish wine has become so much more varied and, yes, elegant in the past decade or so. As the name of the event, Viñateros (which is the Spanish for vigneron or winegrower), meant to suggest, this is a development led by small producers, often working in out-of-the-way places and with long-neglected vineyards, such as those found in the Gredos mountains near Madrid. This part of Spain has become known for its fascinatingly pale, herby pinot noir-like garnacha red wines, but such richly satisfying, yet nervy and textured whites as Fernando Garcia’s Picarana are pretty special too.</p><p><strong>Verónica Ortega Cobrana, Bierzo, Spain 2017 (£24.28, <a href="https://www.vinetrail.co.uk/">Vine Trail</a>)</strong> For a taste of that wild, pale and interesting Gredos garnacha, names to look out for include Daniel Landi and his Commando G project and 4 Monos. But Gredos most certainly doesn’t have the monopoly on haunting reds. In the northwest of the country, the mencía variety is responsible for some wonderfully evocative wines. Among the most captivating wines at the Viñateros event was Veronica Ortega’s blend of mostly mencía with a handful of local white grape varieties from a very old (90-year-old) vineyard in the cool high up (750m) in Bierzo: so pretty in its violet-petal and red berry aromas, and so graceful with its feathery tannins and fresh Atlantic breeziness. There was elegance, too, from the margins of Spain’s most famous region, Rioja, not least in the fabulously silky, pure-fruited, quietly powerful Bodega Lanzaga 2014 (£19.35, <a href="https://www.winebuyers.com/">Wine Buyers</a>) from one of the original leading lights of modern Spanish wine, Telmo Rodríguez.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/06/spains-elegant-new-wave-the-varied-haunting-fascinating-new-spanish-wines">Continue reading...</a>

## Why we need worst-case thinking to prevent pandemics

<p>Threats to humanity, and how we address them, define our time. Why are we still so complacent about facing up to existential risk? By Toby Ord</p><p>The world is in the early stages of what may be the most deadly pandemic of the past 100 years. In China, thousands of people have already died; large outbreaks have begun in South Korea, Iran and Italy; and the rest of the world is bracing for impact. We do not yet know whether the final toll will be measured in thousands or hundreds of thousands. For all our advances in medicine, humanity remains much more vulnerable to pandemics than we would like to believe.</p><p>To understand our vulnerability, and to determine what steps must be taken to end it, it is useful to ask about the very worst-case scenarios. Just how bad could a pandemic be? In science fiction, we sometimes encounter the idea of a pandemic so severe that it could cause the end of civilisation, or even of humanity itself. Such a risk to humanity’s entire future is known as an existential risk. We can say with certainty that the novel coronavirus, named Covid-19, does not pose such a risk. But could the next pandemic? To find out, and to put the current outbreak into greater context, let us turn to the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk">Continue reading...</a>

Don’t expect Wednesday’s budget to contain the sort of populist redistribution that he promised during the election<p>Among the biggest things the prime minister wants you to know about him is that he is a revolutionary. A radical. An insurgent. Yes, on paper Boris Johnson may be a Bullingdon, Telegraph, establishment insider but in the flesh, dear voter, he is as much an outsider as you. He shares your desire to shake up this country like a drying Polaroid, to demolish the corroded old political-economic order and erect instead something shiny and new.</p><p>Such is the message repeated over and again by his team. And it works a treat. Accounting for last December’s electoral devastation, Jeremy Corbyn’s team pin part of the blame on how the Conservative leader outflanked their man as the rebel of SW1. As for pundits and politicians, they take seriously all the talk of a pinstriped insurrection. Even while broadsheet commentators this week deplore <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/04/priti-patel-metoo-civil-service-brexit-philip-rutnam" title="">Priti Patel’s alleged bullying</a> of senior Whitehall officials (denied by the home secretary), in the very next paragraph they chalk it up as the inevitable price of all that reforming zeal.

<p>Last week the Court of Appeal ruled the decision to allow the Heathrow expansion was unlawful because it did not take climate commitments into account. Is this the end of the third runway? And: how our quest for a good night’s sleep is leading to a landfill crisis</p><p>Over the last 20 years, climate campaigners opposing aviation expansion have seen the proposed third runway at Heathrow killed off, rise again on the back of reneged promises and government U-turns, and be given political propulsion when MPs voted in 2018 for it to go ahead.</p><p>But last week, the appeal court declared the government’s plans illegal and in breach of the UK’s climate change commitments. Guardian environment correspondent <strong>Sandra Laville </strong>tells<strong> Anushka Asthana</strong> about the history of the proposed expansion, and why changing attitudes towards the climate crisis might mean the third runway will never be built. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/06/grounded-why-heathrows-third-runway-may-never-happen">Continue reading...</a>

Of course, while a win against Bournemouth would help steady the ship and halt the onset of anything approaching mild jitters, Eddie Howe’s men will head to Anfield to face hosts recently derobed of what had previously resembled a cloak of invincibility. With Fabinho in poor form and Jordan Henderson still sidelined with injury, Liverpool look uncharacteristically vulnerable in midfield and are crying out for on-field leadership.
