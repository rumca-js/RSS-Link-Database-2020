For about $1000(not including the drives) you can build up this system and add up to 20 drives, like Segate's Iron Wolf Pro line. Using Unraid or ProxMox you'll be able to manage your data effectively.\n\nBuy Define 7XL\nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/ZW6CMlG\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/OlDwOs\n\nBuy Ryzen 2600 \nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/u0va6y1\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/K9Q2zfV\n\nBuy Corsair Vengeance LPX 16GB\nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/c4TbFdq\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/GjeD\n\nBuy Asus ROG STRIX B450-F\nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/cNGeUBX\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/8ptR\n\nBuy Corsair HX750 \nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/vXmUAO\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/BY6404\n\nBuy Adata SU655\nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/nBJHqE\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/qtXBCMa\n\nBuy Intel X540-T1 10G NIC \nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/n9AG\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/Gd03\n\nBuy Lsi Logic 9201-16i 16port 6gb/S \nOn Ebay: https://lmg.gg/KlY3B\nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/VnBQ\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/B0VTIE\n\nBuy SFF-8087 to 4x SATA\nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/dzQC\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/SDKW\n\nBuy Seagate IronWolf Pro 16TB\nOn Amazon (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/9fQM\nOn Newegg (PAID LINK): https://geni.us/QdRuZk\n\nPurchases made through some store links may provide some compensation to Linus Media Group.\n\nDiscuss on the forum: https://lmg.gg/qkG5g\n\nOur Affiliates, Referral Programs, and Sponsors: https://lmg.gg/sponsors\nGet Private Internet Access VPN at https://lmg.gg/pialinus2\nGet a Displate Metal Print at https://lmg.gg/displateltt\nGet a 30-day free trial of Amazon Prime at https://lmg.gg/8KV1v\n\nLinus Tech Tips merchandise at http://www.LTTStore.com/ \nOur Test Benches on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/shop/linustechtips \nOur production gear: http://geni.us/cvOS\nGet your ticket to LTX 2020: https://www.ltxexpo.com/\n\nTwitter - https://twitter.com/linustech\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/LinusTech\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/linustech\nTwitch - https://www.twitch.tv/linustech \n\nIntro Screen Music Credit:\nTitle: Laszlo - Supernova\nVideo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKfxmFU3lWY\niTunes Download Link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/supernova/id936805712\nArtist Link: https://soundcloud.com/laszlomusic\n\nOutro Screen Music Credit: Approaching Nirvana - Sugar High http://www.youtube.com/approachingnirvana", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAy9N1vX76o", "date_published": "2020-03-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCXuqSBlHAE6Xw-yeJA0Tunw", "title": "UNFIXABLE Intel CPU Flaw - WAN Show Mar 6, 2020", "description": "Visit https://www.squarespace.com/WAN to try it free for 14 days free and use offer code WAN for 10% off\n\nSave 15% today with offer code LTT on Displate at https://lmg.gg/displatewan\n\nSign up for Private Internet Access VPN at https://lmg.gg/piawan\n\nBuy LTX 2020 Presented by Intel Tickets: https://lmg.gg/ltx20tickets\nLearn more about LTX 2020: https://www.ltxexpo.com/\nLTX 2020 Activities: https://www.ltxexpo.com/attractions\nLTX 2020 Special Guests: https://www.ltxexpo.com/guests\n\nBuy an LTT shirt, hoodie, hat, and even our own water bottle at https://lmg.gg/wanlttstore\n\nCheck out Carpool Critics, our new movie podcast: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt-oJR5teQIjOAxCmIQvcgA\n\nTimestamps: http://traffic.libsyn.com/linustechtips/UNFIXABLE_Intel_CPU_Flaw_-_WAN_Show_Mar_6_2020.mp3\n\nPodcast Download: (Courtesy of Lloyd Dunamis)\n\n01:14 INTRO\n01:56 Intel Chip - \"Completely Unpatchable\" Security Flaw\n05:07     \"Requires physical interaction;
