It is now 10 years since Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan began their culinary road trips, and, having taken in the Lake District, Italy and Spain, this fourth instalment looks to be the last. During promotion for the fourth series of the show, Coogan pointed out that even the jokes about The Trip becoming repetitive are in danger of becoming repetitive.</p><p>If it is the last series, then it is bowing out with dignity and sticking to what it knows best, rather than setting fire to its legacy and sending Brydon and Coogan off on an 18-30 all-inclusive at the Ibiza Rocks hotel, though honestly, I would watch that, too. This time, the pair have been \u201ccommissioned by the Observer\u201d to retrace the steps of Odysseus, so The Trip to Greece begins in Turkey, with Coogan doing a Partridge \u201cA-ha!\u201d in a Trojan horse. Fans of the series will know that is pretty much the extent of it. They eat delicious-looking food, spar with one another, and there\u2019s some serious location envy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/03/the-trip-to-greece-review-coogan-and-brydon-have-the-midas-touch\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/03/the-trip-to-greece-review-coogan-and-brydon-have-the-midas-touch", "date_published": "2020-03-03 23:00:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Kane and Rashford could play at Euro 2020, says Gareth Southgate", "description": "<ul><li>Both England strikers currently out injured</li><li>Manager backs Jordan Pickford after Everton error</li></ul><p>Gareth Southgate is optimistic about the possibility of Harry Kane and Marcus Rashford being fit for Euro 2020 and has left the door open for Phil Foden as he anticipated another competitive year of international football.</p><p>Southgate was in Amsterdam for the Nations League draw, the Uefa competition that gives England the chance to lay the ghosts of 2016 after they were drawn against Iceland, as well as Denmark and Belgium, in group A2.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/03/kane-and-rashford-could-play-at-euro-2020-says-gareth-southgate\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/03/kane-and-rashford-could-play-at-euro-2020-says-gareth-southgate", "date_published": "2020-03-03 22:30:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US prosecutors accuse Honduran president of taking drug money", "description": "<p>Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez allegedly took $25,000 in 2013 in exchange for protecting trafficker from law enforcement</p><p>US prosecutors have said that the president of Honduras met a drug trafficker in around 2013 and took $25,000 in exchange for protecting the trafficker from law enforcement.</p><p>The US attorney\u2019s office for the southern district of New York issued a statement referring to President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez only as a \u201chigh-ranking Honduran official\u201d or as \u201cCC-4\u201d, a co-conspirator.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/honduran-president-juan-orlando-hernandez-drug-money\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/honduran-president-juan-orlando-hernandez-drug-money", "date_published": "2020-03-03 22:26:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Miguel Almir\u00f3n's first-half double eases Newcastle through at West Brom", "description": "<p>Newcastle are on their way to Wembley as far as their admirable away support is concerned.

I didn\u2019t discover the joys of Greek food until I lived there as an English teacher after university. At the time supermarkets, such as they were, only sold canned and frozen food. I had to develop a new way of shopping: in markets, grocers and butchers, buying what was fresh, local and in season. This seems unremarkable now but for a South London boy at the time it was a revelation. It took me a few days to develop the courage to even buy tomatoes. Unlike the perfect spheres I was used to, these were large, knobbly affairs of mottled red and green, often covered with flies. But they tasted divine.</p><p>Times have changed, though the Greek attitude to food has not \u2013 and the Peloponnese (the southern peninsula of the mainland) exemplifies this. Not as tourist-heavy as the islands, and fertile: much of what you eat here will still come from local small-holdings and suppliers of meat and fish. It is also the heartland of the revival in Greek wine, and there is even craft beer to be had.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/03/food-lovers-guide-to-peloponnese-trip-to-greece-coogan\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/03/food-lovers-guide-to-peloponnese-trip-to-greece-coogan", "date_published": "2020-03-03 06:30:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "A look back at some of AAP's best photographs \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>Australian Associated Press <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/03/aap-to-close-after-wire-service-tells-staff-it-is-no-longer-viable\">is to close</a> after 85 years of supplying images and news articles to national and global newspapers, broadcasters and \u2013 in recent years \u2013 websites.
