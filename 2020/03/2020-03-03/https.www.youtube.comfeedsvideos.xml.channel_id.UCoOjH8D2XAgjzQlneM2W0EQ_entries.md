Drug cartels are a lot like Walmart
The biggest complaint about Walmart is that they’re kinda like a monopoly. They’re able dictate how much they’re willing to pay suppliers for their products because they’re the biggest buyer. Instead of Walmart being a monopoly, it’s a monopsony. 

Drug cartels have the same advantage
Most of them don’t grow their own drugs, they buy drugs from ordinary poor farmers, that are just trying to make a living
Then they package it up and handle all the distribution to consumers. They’re able to keep their costs down even when the farmer’s costs go up

Most retail businesses sell their products with around a 10 to 100% markup from the wholesale price
Markups in the drug business are a little bit more steep than that
Instead of a 10-100% markup, going from $385 to $122,000 is more like a 30,000% markup

But it’s still pretty profitable because drugs are kinda like the marketeer’s dream
Since man started selling products, they’ve devised better and better ways to make their products more addictive. But drugs are as addictive as it gets!

The drug trade is the ultimate form of entrepreneurship
Instead of a traditional market where anyone can easily set up shop, the drug trade is a network market, where a big part of your success is from the connections you have. How good are you at managing relationships? 

With all this money on the line, drug traffickers have tried nearly every idea, so what innovation can you bring to the table

“an organization’s people are its most valuable asset” If you want to build a drug cartel empire, then you’re gonna need people. You have to recruit these people in secrecy, without job postings, whiling making sure they’re not undercover cops, informants. If you’re in policed countries like the US or UK, another great option is to use independent contractors
