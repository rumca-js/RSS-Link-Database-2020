<p>The comics’ semi-fictionalised food tour ends in the Med, as they deepen the moving pathos behind their celebrity impressions and endless bickering</p><p>Scheduling <a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/channel/sky-one/the-trip-to">The Trip to Greece</a> (Sky One) to appear during the last dregs of a miserable, wet British winter is either an act of wanton cruelty or an escapist dream, depending on whether you’re feeling unreasonably upbeat or not. It is now 10 years since Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan began their culinary road trips, and, having taken in the Lake District, Italy and Spain, this fourth instalment looks to be the last. During promotion for the fourth series of the show, Coogan pointed out that even the jokes about The Trip becoming repetitive are in danger of becoming repetitive.</p><p>If it is the last series, then it is bowing out with dignity and sticking to what it knows best, rather than setting fire to its legacy and sending Brydon and Coogan off on an 18-30 all-inclusive at the Ibiza Rocks hotel, though honestly, I would watch that, too. This time, the pair have been “commissioned by the Observer” to retrace the steps of Odysseus, so The Trip to Greece begins in Turkey, with Coogan doing a Partridge “A-ha!” in a Trojan horse. Fans of the series will know that is pretty much the extent of it. They eat delicious-looking food, spar with one another, and there’s some serious location envy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/03/the-trip-to-greece-review-coogan-and-brydon-have-the-midas-touch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A measured response is appropriate. But important questions remain about our ability to tackle Covid-19</p><p>As Covid-19 has spread, to more than 70 countries already, people are learning not only about the new coronavirus, but about their governments’ ability to respond to it. In many countries, from China to South Korea and Iran, anger at the shortcomings is widely held and deeply felt. With a low but fast-growing tally of <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/coronavirus-uk-twelve-more-cases-51-a4377231.html" title="">51 cases</a> in the UK, the British government, none too soon, has published its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/explained-uk-coronavirus-action-plan" title="">action plan</a>.</p><p>This is a government that believes in providing opportunities rather than a safety net; it seems reluctant to employ the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/21/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnson-neglecting-the-nation" title="">powers of the state</a> to shield or protect. Nor does it want to take the blame for problems. One might have been forgiven for thinking that Boris Johnson had self-isolated, given how little we have seen of him recently. The public has already taken matters into its own hands, with consumers stockpiling canned goods and hand sanitiser. But this is not the kind of situation that can be managed without the state, and Mr Johnson, too, can see the political perils of simply disappearing from the scene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/the-guardian-view-on-the-uks-coronavirus-plan-sensible-but-belated">Continue reading...</a>

The mournful, three-minute speech was delivered in the rain, a disembodied arm holding an umbrella above his head. “I have been the target of a vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign,” he announced, looking as visibly distressed as it is possible for a career civil servant to be. “My experience has been extreme.” Colleagues had complained that the home secretary, Priti Patel, was shouting and swearing at them, “behaviour that created fear, and needed some bravery to call out”. She has denied allegations of bullying.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/02/cabinet-office-to-investigate-priti-patel-bullying-claims" title="">Further details have emerged</a>, and it is easy to view Rutnam’s resignation as an honourable gesture.

Set against his department’s recent dismal record, the sacrifice of his 33-year career in response to a minister’s bullying behaviour feels problematic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/windrush-bullying-home-office-philip-rutnam">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An empathy-signalling movement has taken off on social media. But the internet has ways of making us into wicked creatures</p><p>In a brief but doomed attempt to dance around a looming deadline earlier this week I found myself playing an online game called Town of Idiots. The idea of the game itself is very neat – you and 16 other players have to all figure out which roles have been assigned to you before either the devil or the mafia murder you in the night, and some people are lying and some are not – but it is near instantly ruined because the only way you can communicate with other players is through a completely uncensored, unmoderated chat room, like the ones of the internet of yore, and that means what should be a wholesome whodunnit swiftly devolves into a load of 15-year-old American children competing with each other to see who can send the most shocking slurs.

<p><strong>Hayward gallery, London</strong><br />Animated, trembling, majestic, fake, doomed, plastic, printed, dying and dead trees. They’re all there in this pleasurable but frustrating exhibition that would benefit from focusing on humans and our stupidity too</p><p>Running the entire width of one floor at London’s Hayward gallery is a six-screen video which depicts, at about life size, a spruce tree swaying in the breeze in Finland.

The six projected sections of the tree tremble and sway out of sync with one another, adding to a growing sense of majestic befuddlement. You can’t take it in all at once, any more than you could if you stood before the real thing. Distantly, I hear the branches soughing and faint birdsong.

Pascale Marthine Tayou’s tree bears a blossom of colourful plastic bags which rustle in the draft from the gallery’s air conditioning, while Simryn Gill’s photographs of mangroves in the Straits of Malacca focus on the plastic detritus, lost fishing gear and clothing that festoon the branches in a horrible bunting on the edge of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/03/among-the-trees-review-hayward-gallery-london-adrian-searle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister sold the UK a dream with a casual disregard for reality. The EU trade talks will test his bombast</p><p>Bad ideas blunt the sharpest minds, and Boris Johnson’s intellect was hardly an instrument of surgical precision before it rubbed up against a hard Brexit. The prime minister is no fool, but his talents are ill-suited to crafting a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/01/brexit-what-are-the-key-flashpoints-as-eu-uk-trade-talks-begin" title="">new relationship with the EU</a>. Johnson’s cleverness is rhetorical; his unique talent is for lifting spirits while lowering expectations. His upbeat bombast is laced with self-deprecation conveyed in his artfully tousled appearance and the elongated ums and ahs that signal improvisation, although the lines are scripted.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2020/mar/02/fishing-farming-johnson-brussels">On fishing and farming, Johnson may again be forced to back down | Simon Jenkins</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/03/boris-johnson-brexit-eu-trade-talks">Continue reading...</a>

Between 2010 and 2020, Conservative cuts destroyed the fabric of society as we know it. Speaking to people on the frontline reveals the ways our lives have been changed for ever<p>What happened in the UK between 2010 and 2020 will scar us for the rest of our lives. David Cameron’s Conservatives, only just victorious in the 2010 election, sold austerity as a necessary response to the 2008 financial crash. The exact social consequences of these cuts were spelled out last week in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century" title="">Michael Marmot’s report</a> for the Institute of Health Equity: for the first time in a century, life expectancy has stopped growing and for women in poor areas actually fallen. </p><p>We should never stop reminding ourselves just what an astonishing decade we have lived through. In the aftermath of the crash, employment climbed and stayed remarkably high. But these new jobs paid badly and it took until two months ago for earnings to reach where they were before 2008. It is no surprise that debt is mountainous: each household owes on average £15,385, not counting their mortgages. The gap between rich and poor has widened; the young are now worse off than their parents at their age; home ownership has declined steeply – families are stuck in life-long and precarious private renting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/03/lost-decade-hidden-story-how-austerity-broke-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the new Trip to Greece series Coogan and Brydon (plus Jagger, Caine and friends) are on an odyssey that takes in this peninsula’s superb food. Here are our highlights …</p><p>When I first went to Greece, some 30 years ago, I was a teenage backpacker and survived on biscuits and scrumped (delicious) lemons. I didn’t discover the joys of Greek food until I lived there as an English teacher after university. At the time supermarkets, such as they were, only sold canned and frozen food. I had to develop a new way of shopping: in markets, grocers and butchers, buying what was fresh, local and in season. This seems unremarkable now but for a South London boy at the time it was a revelation. It took me a few days to develop the courage to even buy tomatoes. Unlike the perfect spheres I was used to, these were large, knobbly affairs of mottled red and green, often covered with flies. But they tasted divine.</p><p>Times have changed, though the Greek attitude to food has not – and the Peloponnese (the southern peninsula of the mainland) exemplifies this. Not as tourist-heavy as the islands, and fertile: much of what you eat here will still come from local small-holdings and suppliers of meat and fish. It is also the heartland of the revival in Greek wine, and there is even craft beer to be had.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/03/food-lovers-guide-to-peloponnese-trip-to-greece-coogan">Continue reading...</a>
