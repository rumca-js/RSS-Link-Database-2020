We drop into Apex Legends to see if we can become champions of the arena when everything looks like it’s coated in a thick layer of Vaseline. 

There are people who are always pushing for better graphics and smoother textures. And then there are idiots like us. Welcome back to Potato Mode, the series where we play some of the most visually-appealing video games with their visual settings knocked down to as low as we can.

This episode's victim is Apex Legends. Max Blumenthal and Jean-Luc Seipke drop into Respawn's battle royale to see how World's Edge looks without all the technical settings that make it one of the prettiest locations in the Outlands. Spoiler alert: it looks terrible, almost nightmarishly bad. We do not recommend playing the game this way.

Instead, play Apex Legends the way it was meant to be played--and while you're at it, take the time to enjoy the gameplay changes implemented into the battle royale during System Override. The addition of Octane's heirloom brings the current count of Apex Legends' rarest items to five, and it's now much easier to claim the one you want. The in-game inventory system has also been revamped, largely to make Wattson less of a must-have in Ranked. Respawn continues to alter Bloodhound and Gibraltar too, with the former undergoing numerous transformations that are (finally) making them more of a recon character.

In GameSpot's Apex Legends review, Phil Hornshaw wrote, "Apex Legends is a mix of smart shooter ideas that makes for a competitive, team-based game that gets at all the best parts of battle royale while addressing a lot of the weaknesses. Respawn's intense focus on team play makes Apex more than just a worthy addition to the genre; it's an indicator of where battle royale should go in the future."

Let the hype commence! Bungie revealed more information on Destiny 2's upcoming season alongside an electric gameplay trailer. Here's everything you need to know about the story so far, and what you can look forward to.

Destiny 2 continues its rollout of new content with the Season of the Worthy on March 10, with new story elements, new activities, and new loot. Bungie has finally laid out some of the details about what we can expect from the new season, including the return of Destiny's greatest PvP challenge, the Trials of Osiris. Check out the video above for a full rundown--there's a lot of ground to cover.

Trials is the biggest element of the new season. The weekend event offers some of Destiny 2's greatest, toughest-to-earn rewards, but only if you manage to go through several rounds of competitive play undefeated. Trials has been out of the game since way back in 2018, so its return is a big deal to some of the most dedicated in the Destiny 2 fanbase.

If you're more of a PvE player, though, there's plenty for you as well. The Season of the Worthy is all about working with Rasputin, the giant AI that was central to the Warmind expansion, and the new Seraph Tower activity is all about working with other players to power up the computer so it can defend the solar system. Those are covered on the season's content roadmap. We also know you'll be chasing The 4th Horseman, an Exotic shotgun from the first Destiny, which appeared in the season's trailer.

There are a whole lot more details for the Season of the Worthy in the video above--but don't be surprised if Bungie slips in a few secrets it hasn't placed on the roadmap, as well.

We explore the Kwolok's Hollow, solve some puzzles, and take on a boss in Ori And The Will Of The Wisps for Xbox One and PC. 

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the follow-up to one of the most acclaimed Xbox One titles of this generation, Ori and the Blind Forest. Once again developed by Moon Studios, the sequel aims to take the challenging Metroidvania-style gameplay of the first game and expand on it. The sequel features new movement abilities and, thanks to a variety of new weapons, expanded combat.

Of course, what people really responded to in the first game is the beautiful art style and world. It also had a surprisingly emotional story thanks to its wonderfully animated characters and heartfelt soundtrack. Naturally, expectations for the second game are very high and although we'll have to wait for the game's launch to see whether it lives up to them. However, we do have a sample of gameplay from Ori and the Will of the Wisps to give you an early indication of how it's shaping up. 

In the video above we head to Kwolok's Hollow and do some exploration, battling enemies and solving puzzles along the way. The video culminates in a boss battle and, as a whole, should give you a good taster of the gameplay experience.  

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is set for release on Xbox One and PC on March 11.
