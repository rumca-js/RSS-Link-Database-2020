<p>Town historically tied to the sport of kings fears for future after court ruling against racing magnate from Dubai</p><p>On a March afternoon with just the faintest hint of spring in the air Newmarket should have much to look forward to. Flat racing on turf returns within a month, the breeze-ups and the Craven meeting will be along soon afterwards and the posters are up on the lamp posts advertising Guineas weekend in early May.</p><p>In the pubs and betting shops along the High Street, though, there is apprehension in the air, as the town’s biggest employer endures another day of brutally damaging headlines. “Queen to shun Dubai ruler,” is the latest, over a report that the monarch – the patron of the Jockey Club – will no longer be photographed with Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, horse racing’s biggest owner, following a court ruling on Thursday that the Sheikh had organised the abduction and detention of two of his daughters and intimidated his former wife, Princess Haya.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/07/newmarket-sheikh-mohammed-fears-pull-out-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This is still not Tottenham as we know them, but at least the slump has been stopped. José Mourinho has never lost four games in a row before, let alone five, so he will have been pleased to see his side come back from a goal down and a shocking first-half performance to draw a line under the losing sequence, even if Burnley and their captain, Ben Mee, will be kicking themselves for letting their visitors back into the game.</p><p>Mee was guilty of an uncontrolled tackle at the start of the second half that gifted Spurs a penalty and gave them a route back into a game that they never seemed likely to find for themselves. Burnley were so much on top in the first half they were probably not too worried about the number of chances they wasted, but the game changed when Spurs equalised and in the end a point apiece was a fair result. The home side missed their chance to overtake Spurs in the table and will have to console themselves with extending their unbeaten league run to seven matches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/burnley-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arsenal could not afford to squander this opportunity so they will not care too much that, in giving their prospects of Champions League qualification genuine life, they committed something akin to daylight robbery. This was, from start to finish, a slog for Mikel Arteta’s side as they struggled to make their monopoly on possession pay and wobbled repeatedly when probed by an intelligent West Ham. Had Bernd Leno not burnished his status as one of the most underrated keepers around, or the visiting forwards not squandered a slew of clear openings, their claim to a top-four spot would now appear fantastical.

<p>After switching career from music to acting, Cosmo Jarvis looks set to have a big year in 2020 with four new films, including the acclaimed Calm With Horses</p><p>Cosmo Jarvis has deflated slightly since he finished work on Calm With Horses. Director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/20/meet-the-new-directors-who-lit-up-the-film-festivals" title="">Nick Rowland</a> adapted the film from a short story by County Mayo writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/mar/07/young-skins-review-debut-colin-barrett" title="">Colin Barrett</a>, and when it toured the festival circuit, many critics labelled it an extraordinary debut for the film-maker and a breakout performance for Jarvis, who plays Arm, a former boxer turned gangland enforcer, with heartbreaking complexity.</p><p>Arm works at the behest of nasty small‑town crooks on the west coast of Ireland. In private, they refer to him as “the halfwit”, and on screen, he is a hulking presence, looming tall and wide over the men unfortunate enough to cross his path. Jarvis had to bulk up to play him. “Luckily they just wanted it to look like he was once in shape,” he says. He ate a lot, drank milkshakes and lifted weights to get the presence he needed. Arm is as naive as he is vicious, and a slow-moving, lumbering menace, while Jarvis is febrile and fidgety, vibrating with a quicker energy.

## The Reach, Thamesmead review – from sink estate to Thames des res

<p>Peabody’s plans to transform the brutalist 60s site into a greener, more congenial space are full of hope. But the required levels of creativity may be hard to sustain</p><p>You might have heard this story before. Back in the 1960s some town planners and local politicians decide to build a vast and ambitious new settlement that will later be described as “utopian”. Architects give these plans the bold concrete forms of the period. Working-class residents move in, many of them pleased to have central heating and indoor bathrooms for the first time. They may or may not like the architecture. Their tolerance of deficiencies in the planning – too few shops or pubs, poor public transport – decreases over the years.</p><p>Then the factories close that gave the residents jobs. Local authorities fail to take care of buildings which, in truth, were designed with insufficient thought to future maintenance. The original plans are left incomplete, omitting some vital element that might have helped it work. Problem tenants are moved in. The place gets called a “sink estate”, or similar. Theorists scatter blame, especially on the architects. Successive decades are spent with different attempts to remediate what is by then seen as a catastrophe. It only becomes more fragmented in the process.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/07/thamesmead-regeneration-london-the-reach-peabody-housing-association">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tom Holland and Chris Pratt give voice to brothers searching to bring their father back to life in a magical fantasy world</p><p>The latest Pixar animation, <em>Onward</em> is heartfelt, slickly executed and potently effective as both a rousing adventure and a tear-jerker. But compared to the very best of Pixar’s output, this can’t help but feel like second tier stuff. Set in a world in which magic has atrophied from lack of use, where unicorns are trash-scavenging vermin, where chubby centaurs rely on four wheels rather than galloping forth on four legs, <em>Onward</em> is, like so many Pixar movies before it, a deft blend of fanciful and relatable.</p><p>The backdrop, rendered in a purple-heavy palette that looks like a visual representation of acute sinus pain, is a stridently realised fantasy world; the story is down to earth and domestic, exploring the frayed bond between two brothers, Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) and Barley (Chris Pratt, exuberant), who lost their father before they got to know him. It’s the emotional rather than the visual element that does the heavy lifting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/07/onward-pixar-review-tom-holland-chris-pratt-julia-louis-dreyfus">Continue reading...</a>

## Mané fires Liverpool past Bournemouth after VAR decision enrages Klopp

<p>Anger shaped Jürgen Klopp’s reaction to Sadio Mané’s winning goal against Bournemouth. Joy, laced with relief, fuelled the return of his trademark celebration after Liverpool put the one bad week in their phenomenal season behind them. Three punches in front of the Kop: one for each victory Liverpool require to guarantee their first league championship for 30 years.</p><p>Mohamed Salah marked his 100th Premier League appearance for the Anfield club with his 70th league goal before Mané brought Liverpool a new English top-flight record of 22 consecutive home league wins. Those are just the headline figures. This was a dogged fight back to winning ways after three defeats in four matches, one that began with conceding a controversial early goal to Callum Wilson, involved a spectacular goal-line clearance from James Milner and ended with a let-off from Nathan Aké in the 90th minute. Liverpool needed cool heads to get over the line rather than polished feet and Milner and Virgil van Dijk delivered with outstanding second-half displays. They were also indebted to cheap Bournemouth errors for the goals that restored invaluable confidence before Atlético Madrid’s visit in the Champions League on Wednesday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/07/liverpool-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Zonal by Don Paterson; The Martian’s Regress by JO Morgan; Come Down by Fiona Sampson; and Loss by David Harsent</p><p>Fans of Don Paterson’s lyric poetry will find his latest volume, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/zonal-9780571338245.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" title=""><strong>Zonal </strong>(Faber, £14.99)</a>, something of a surprise. Often given to self-reinvention, Paterson has always kept musical panache at the forefront of his multi-award-winning verse, be it in the laddish smarts of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/18/selected-poems-don-paterson-review" title=""><em>Nil Nil</em>,</a> the paternal meditations of <em>Landing Light</em>, or the metaphysical reach of <em>Rain</em>. This new book is not only his most seemingly confessional, but also a stylistic departure. Taking its cues from the first season of the TV classic <em>The Twilight Zone</em>, its often surreal, long-lined narratives jump from funny to sad to profound with a suppleness somewhere between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/09/selected-poems-frank-ohara-review" title="">Frank O’Hara</a> and CK Williams. “I am trying hard not to be that guy,” sighs the speaker in one poem, “and while I can fall prey to bitterness, I refuse to sound like some middle-aged incel addicted to Jordan Peterson videos.” The poet’s cutting wit and acute awareness aside, the best poems here are the reimagined character portraits that bookend the collection: “Lazarus”, in which self-improvement meets the Orphic contemplation of the void; and “Death”, in which a self-deceiving salesman tries to buy off the grim reaper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/best-recent-poetry-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Get to the point, accept that our queen is better – and don’t get me started on hygge</p><p>I’m from Denmark, but have lived in the UK for almost eight years. I’d love to stay. Fingers crossed. I call both countries home, but still find myself caught between the two because while there are Briticisms I have embraced, there are other things I can’t. For as long as there is an ocean between us, or two hours on a low-budget aeroplane, there will always be some fundamental differences between our two kingdoms. Here are my five biggest.</p><p><strong>You </strong><strong>don’t get to the point</strong><br />The Danes are direct. If you want to send a professional email to someone, asking for some files, regardless of how little you know them, your email will read: “Hey, send the files.” That’s it. It took me a while to learn the British way of making every request sound as if you are asking a person for their first-born’s hand in marriage. “Dearest Cliff, I hope you are well. I do apologise for getting in touch on this godless Tuesday, but I hope you might consider even the slightest possibility of perhaps finding the time…” And so on. My emails now take 20 times longer to write. Often, I forget the pleasantries and simply send a Danish-style four-word message. Then I am filled with British shame. For this reason, I have considered adding an email signature that reads: “I’m not rude, I’m Danish.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/07/sofie-hagen-sex-food-monarchy-hygge-britain-and-denmark-are-worlds-apart">Continue reading...</a>

## Recollections of My Non-Existence by Rebecca Solnit review – memoir and male violence

<p>The acclaimed feminist writer on her formative years, feeling silenced and the first room of her own – a light-filled flat in San Francisco </p><p>One Sunday in 1980, the 19-year-old <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/15/rebecca-solnit-hope-in-the-dark-new-essay-embrace-unknown" title="">Rebecca Solnit</a> went to see the studio flat in San Francisco that would be her home for the next 26 years. She’d been living in hostels since she moved away from her parents a few years earlier, so this was the first room of her own. She found in the corner studio in Lyon Street, with its light-filled bay windows and golden oak floors, the beginnings of an adult identity. She filled the space with things collected on walks – lichen-covered twigs, birds’ nests, bones – and with old furniture and books. She didn’t yet know that she was a feminist or a writer but she knew that she was a reader and that she was outraged by the expectations of the men around her, whether it was the male poets seeking a muse or the men who followed her in the street, making her panic that she could end up as one of the women she read about in news reports: “beatnik girl slain by sailor looking for love”.</p><p><em>Recollections of My Non-Existence</em> announces itself as a memoir that will reveal how this skinny, friendless girl found her voice and her place in the world. There’s a lot of first person writing across Solnit’s books. She has always used her own experience, describing herself walking across cities and deserts, or evading the violence or speechifying of men. And her take on culture is original enough that it wouldn’t be surprising if her take on memoir was original too. But this book feels a little thin, because she’s not an introspective writer. She’s not curious about the relationship between thoughts and feelings or about her own ambivalence or contradictions. There is not here the plunge inwards, the giddying rush of embodied thinking, that we get in, say, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review" title="">Maggie Nelson’s </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review" title="">The Argonauts</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review" title="">.</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/recollections-my-non-existence-rebecca-solnit-review">Continue reading...</a>

They are catastrophic. They appear, I’m sorry to say, like pimples on an 18-year-old kid. You don’t know where they will pop up, or when.” The 42-year-old speaks in his native Russian, his expressive face switching from boyish amusement to tortured concern in a flash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/volodymyr-zelenskiy-tv-comic-who-became-ukraine-president-trump-putin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a Dutch bestseller about childhood loss to a passionate lesbian romance in France, a refugee’s journey from Iraq and the dark side of Sweden ... six novelists telling fresh stories about Europe</p><p><br />When Marieke Lucas Rijneveld was three years old, Rijneveld’s 12-year-old brother was knocked over and killed by a bus as he walked to school from the family farm. Rijneveld’s response to this early confrontation with the unthinkable was not to draw a veil over it, but to build two books around it. “I think it’s unfortunate for a family to have a writer born into it,” says the 28-year-old author, serenely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/07/shock-of-new-novelists-stories-europe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To celebrate Europe, writers in all 27 EU countries share a favourite place that evokes the spirit of their nation</p><p>I often dream of the journey over the Taygetos mountains from the western coast of the <strong>Peloponnese</strong> peninsula to the town of Sparta. It’s a trip I’ve done many times, most recently with my family. You start by the beaches of Kalamata, where my daughter was born, and a mere 10-minute drive up a small winding road takes you into the mountains, with the white houses and sea below. This is the route Telemachus (Odysseus’ son) took to visit Menelaus and Helen, newly returned from Troy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/07/my-europe-27-things-we-love-european-union">Continue reading...</a>
