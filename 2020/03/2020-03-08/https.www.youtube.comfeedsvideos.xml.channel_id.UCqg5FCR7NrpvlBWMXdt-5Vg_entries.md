Gravewood High is a stealth/horror game with mild rogue-like elements… very mild, so mild in fact that I didn’t notice any rogue-like elements.

Several local students have gone missing so you explore the creepy high school looking for clues, but there’s a sinister teacher roaming the halls… sinister-ly.

As you delve deeper into the school you’ll find tools to help your exploration, but none more powerful than your ability to hide in a locker and wait for the teacher to walk away.
