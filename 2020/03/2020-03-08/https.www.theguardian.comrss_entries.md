<ul><li>Englishman wins by one from Marc Leishman</li><li>Rory McIlroy fades away with 40 on front nine</li></ul><p>“That” European Tour has delivered once again. A week after Paul Azinger caused an international incident with snippy comments about the ability or otherwise of Europe’s best players to prevail in the United States, Tyrrell Hatton offered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/06/tiger-woods-masters-defence-doubt-players-championship-withdrawal" title="">the perfect response</a>. On yet another gruelling afternoon at Bay Hill, Hatton claimed the Arnold Palmer Invitational and the biggest cheque – just short of $1.7m (£1.3m) – of his career. This marked the fifth win in succession of this tournament by a non-American; three of whom are European. A penny for Azinger’s thoughts.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/05/ian-poulter-europe-zinger-paul-azinger-european-tour-golf">Ian Poulter and Europe speak as one after zinger from Paul Azinger | Ewan Murray</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/08/tyrrell-hatton-holds-on-for-arnold-palmer-invitational-victory">Continue reading...</a>

## Eddie Jones's antagonistic personality should be of concern to the RFU

<p>The England coach has improved the national side but calamitous PR, the perverse selections and occasional verbal excesses overshadow his role</p><p>At some stage in the next fortnight Eddie Jones will sit down for dinner with the Rugby Football Union’s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, to discuss the future. There will be no shortage of agenda items, not least the fall-out from a tempestuous Anglo-Welsh contest which at times was more like rollerball than rugby. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/07/england-wales-six-nations-match-report" title="">England may have collected a triple crown</a> but, not for the first time, the hosts won few awards for grace or diplomacy.</p><p>Does it matter how a national team behaves as long as it wins? Jones has never been over-burdened by such considerations but over the coming months the RFU has a fundamental decision to make. Does it stick with the devil it knows and renew its vows with a man increasingly threatening José Mourinho’s position as the country’s prickliest coach? Or does it take a more holistic view, decide a less Marmite personality will improve the squad’s 2023 World Cup prospects and tell Jones his contract will not be renewed when it expires next year?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/08/eddie-joness-antagonistic-personality-should-be-of-concern-to-the-rfu">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson made it all sound so easy during the election. But the pressure of the coronavirus outbreak means the dream of a big strategic budget is for the birds</p><p>Slogans can win elections. But slogans won’t cut it in government. Three months ago, Boris Johnson powered to a general election victory endlessly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/04/boris-johnson-sets-out-plans-for-first-100-days-if-he-wins-election" title="">promising</a> to “get Brexit done” and deliver on “the people’s priorities”. But this prime minister does not merely campaign in slogans. He tries to govern in them too. After last month’s reshuffle, the first cabinet meeting began with a demeaning to-and-fro exchange about the hospitals, police officers and nurses the new ministers were pledged to deliver. Every week, Mr Johnson breezes through prime minister’s questions with a similarly vacuous recitation. Having taken Britain out of the European Union (although this is emphatically not the same as getting Brexit done), Mr Johnson now tries to give the impression that restoring Britain’s public services also requires nothing more than a quick collective chant by him and his ministerial courtiers.</p><p>Democratic politics deserves better than this. Fortunately, events are starting to force Mr Johnson’s hand. The onward spread of the Covid-19 coronavirus clearly demands a different level of national leadership from the facetious version that the prime ministers has offered so far. The continuing impact of the winter floods, which found Mr Johnson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/08/boris-johnson-heckled-as-a-traitor-while-visiting-flood-hit-worcestershire" title="">wanting</a>, presents a similarly long-term challenge for the government across the stricken regions of Britain. Next month, he may also face a more effective <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/08/lisa-nandy-demands-answers-missing-labour-leadership-ballots" title="">opposition leader</a> than Jeremy Corbyn can ever manage to be in his lame duck phase.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-budget-the-priorities-have-changed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How do our clothes affect our mood? Sharon Walker delves into her wardrobe with fashion psychologist Dawnn Karen and finds a poignant explanation for her love of party dresses</p><p>Friday night, 11pm. I am snapping a selfie in the bedroom mirror. Not for Instagram I hasten to add – no one over 40 should do that – but for my “Best Dressed” folder of outfits. Next to me on a chair is a mountain of clothes that have been lying fallow in my wardrobe for more than a year. Some haven’t seen the light of day for as much as a decade. I must wear them all within a week or drag them kicking and screaming to the charity shop. This is all part of a Radical Wardrobe Edit that I’m racing to complete, as decreed by <a href="https://www.fashionpsychologysuccess.com/" title="">Dawnn Karen</a>, a fashion psychologist, whose new book <em>Dress Your Best Life</em> promises to “harness the power of clothes to transform your life”.</p><p>The “new” outfits I’ve unearthed from this growing pile are pinging me pleasing little hits of dopamine, delivering the kind of euphoric high I might ordinarily experience on the <a href="https://www.ganni.com/en-gb/home" title="">Ganni</a> website, but the thought of jettisoning a silver vintage dress brings me out in a cold sweat, even though I know there’s no chance I’ll ever again fit into it and would, in any case, rarely have an occasion to wear it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/08/my-wardrobe-is-bursting-with-sequins-what-does-that-say-about-me">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Louise Snyder: ‘Domestic abuse is as common as rain'

<p>Rachel Louise Snyder talks about the personal history behind her award-winning book, No Visible Bruises, which charts the shocking rise of familial violence against women in the US</p><p>In 2002, Dorothy Giunta-Cotter was shot and killed in her own home in Massachusetts by her husband and relentless abuser of 20 years, William Cotter. He then turned the gun on himself. Dorothy, 35, had fled from him with their two daughters a few days earlier because Cotter had begun to hurt their 11-year-old, but she had refused the offer of a refuge. She told the police that if her daughters were with her, Cotter would find them, and kill all three. “She attempted to avert the worst of two terrible outcomes,” wrote the American journalist Rachel Louise Snyder in an article published in the <em>New Yorker </em>in 2013, “the loss of her daughters’ lives along with her own.”</p><p>That article, A Raised Hand, became part of eight years of research from one of the frontlines of what the World Health Organization (WHO) has deemed “a global epidemic”. Snyder’s work is now an award-winning book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/no-visible-bruises-9781912854851.html" title="">No Visible Bruises: What We Don’t Know About Domestic Violence Can Kill Us</a></em>. In the UK, the issue of domestic abuse is not “taboo”, which Snyder says the subject still is in the US. Here, while it may be a family secret, it is recognised and discussed nationally; the impact of austerity on closing refuges, slashing legal aid and axing specialist domestic abuse services, has kept the issue <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/sep/13/domestic-violence-killings-in-uk-at-five-year-high" title="">high on the UK agenda</a>. It’s a crime that impacts on men too but women make up the overwhelming majority of victims. Eighty women were killed by a partner or ex in the year to March 2019, an increase of 27% on the previous year, while an incident of domestic abuse is reported every minute in England and Wales. The government estimates that the social and economic cost of domestic abuse is a staggering £66bn a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/08/rachel-louise-snyder-no-visible-bruises-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve always had loads of friends but recently decided that many of them had to go. It has simplified and enriched my life</p><p>One night about six months ago, as I was tidying up for the babysitter at the same time as battling to put the kids to bed, all while trying to answer a multitude of suddenly-urgent questions they’d had all day to ask, and put lipstick on, I caught sight of my frantic-looking face in the mirror. What, I wondered, was I doing all this for? Was it worth it simply to spend the evening with a couple we didn’t really like, drink insipid wine and make shallow small-talk about other people we don’t really know or want to spend time with?</p><p>I’ve always been a more-the-merrier type person and someone who prided herself on being a good friend. I have friends from all areas of my life – school, university, work – but as I got older and the demands of raising three young children and work have grown, I’ve realised that something had to give. And that something has ended up being my friendships. Not all of them, but I’ve certainly had something of a reassessment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/08/i-have-culled-my-friends-to-just-the-ones-i-value">Continue reading...</a>

Meanwhile men’s rights activists, living in a parallel universe they deem “gynocentric”, <a href="https://avoiceformen.com/a-voice-for-men/mission-statement/" title="">believe</a> “the efforts to enhance the rights of women have become toxic efforts to undermine the rights of men”.</p><p>This kind of narrative has been around for more than 30 years. Starting with fathers angry about custody rights, it mutated into a rabid men’s rights movement with distinctive male supremacist characteristics.

## The myths of both left and right stop us seeing the true story of inequality | Torsten Bell

<p>New data reveals that the recent history of wealth is more complex than we think</p><p>We live in a country shaped by our past but we are not very good at understanding it – not least when it comes to the debates about living standards and inequality that are central to our politics and economics. If we want to make sense of how Brexit Britain got to this point and where to go from here, the task is not just to recognise the legacy of decades past but also that times change, asking new questions of us as they do so.</p><p>Too often, the stories told on both sides of our politics drive towards the wrong questions and offer the wrong policy answers. For the left, that means asserting that inequality is always rising. This is not only wrong, but dangerous in spreading the idea it is normal, when it’s anything but.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/inequality-myths-left-right-stop-us-seeing-true-story">Continue reading...</a>

## Is it ever acceptable for a feminist to hire a cleaner?

<p>The author of a new book on domestic work struggled with the idea of someone doing her hoovering – so she tried giving her cleaner a mop and a fair wage</p><p>The day my cleaner used to visit, I would return home in the evening to the smell of Dettol mixed with Tania’s sweat, to a clean kitchen and bathroom and a drenching sense of guilt. It was the same unease that greeted me when I collected my son Leo from his nursery – a national chain disproportionately staffed by women of colour – or bought clothes from a mainstream clothing outlet that relies, as many do, on female garment workers in the global south. My book, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-home-stretch-9781786497574.html" title=""><em>The Home Stretch</em></a>, is a result of the question that bubbled up from this sense of discomfort: can I hire a cleaner with a (clean) feminist conscience?</p><p>Bought-in domestic labour is an increasingly significant feature of middle-class home life. There are now <a href="https://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---migrant/documents/briefingnote/wcms_490162.pdf" title="">67 million domestic workers worldwide</a>: they are cleaners and cooks, but also carers for children, the elderly and disabled. Their number is growing rapidly, as longer life expectancies combine with a climate in which fewer women forgo paid employment, to create a yawning global care gap. One in three Britons now pays a domestic cleaner, in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/18/half-millenials-hiring-cleaners-busy-clean-one-bed-flats/" title="">a trend led by the urban under-35</a>s, many of whom report contracting a cleaner, in 93% of cases a female cleaner, as a means of avoiding household disputes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/08/acceptable-for-feminist-to-hire-cleaner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris John’s administration is to be praised for making an about-turn</p><p>‘People with knowledge should talk about it, not football managers.” Such was the refreshingly honest response of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/jurgen-klopp" title="">Jürgen Klopp</a> when pressed for his views about coronavirus by journalists last week. “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkIZZCbxngQ" title="">My opinion about corona is not important</a>.” The Liverpool manager’s comments embody an important sentiment that seems to have emerged in this outbreak: a reappraisal of the importance of experts in the wake of their denigration by populist leaders around the world.</p><p>This government is not a fan of experts. For months, it has repeatedly ignored warnings from scientists, trade experts and economists about the impact of a hard Brexit on the country’s economic wellbeing and security. It has implicitly declared war on the civil service: aides and advisers liberally brief against “the blob” and its perceived resistance to ripping up a supposedly pointless rulebook. But thankfully – perhaps with as much a view to protecting its own political fortunes as well as public health – ministers have temporarily put their hostility towards experts and civil servants aside. Last week, we criticised the government’s slow response to the crisis: holding back ministers from news programmes that had caused it offence; taking days to call a meeting of Cobra chaired by the PM. But as the government has moved from the “contain” to the “delay” phase of its response, there has been a marked improvement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/08/observer-view-on-government-improved-response-to-coronavirus-outbreak">Continue reading...</a>
