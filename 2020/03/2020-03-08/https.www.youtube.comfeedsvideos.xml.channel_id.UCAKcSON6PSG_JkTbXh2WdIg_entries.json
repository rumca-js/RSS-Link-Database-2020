And despite the dryness of his singing, Bejar communicates a great understanding of our collective sadness and alienation. It's what makes his music so relatable.\n\nPERSONNEL\nDan Bejar, vocals\nDavid Carswell, guitar\nNicholas Bragg, guitar\nJoshua Wells, drums\nColin Cowan, bass\nTed Bois, keyboards\n\nCREDITS\nHelen Teague, Video\nEric Romani, Audio\nJesse Wiza, Production\n\nMORE FROM THIS SESSION\nThe Raven: https://youtu.be/bJnsD9uK5ag\nThe Man in Black's Blues: https://youtu.be/R9GEMpHjwy8\n\n#Indie #SingerSongwriter #Destroyer", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1RmNv-nnYc", "date_published": "2020-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Destroyer - The Man in Black's Blues (Live at The Current)", "description": "Watch Destroyer - Dan Bejar and his band - play \"The Man in Black's Blues\" from the album 'Have We Met,' released January 31, 2020 on Merge Records and Dead Oceans.\n\n\"When you're looking for nothing, and you find nothing is more beautiful than anything you ever knew,\" sings Dan Bejar on \"The Man in Black's Blues.\" It's an apt line from Bejar, who performs under the moniker Destroyer. His music often characterized as a distant people watcher, a detached narrator surveying apartment tenements and sparsely populated bars for lost souls.\n\nPERSONNEL\nDan Bejar, vocals\nDavid Carswell, guitar\nNicholas Bragg, guitar\nJoshua Wells, drums\nColin Cowan, bass\nTed Bois, keyboards\n\nCREDITS\nHelen Teague, Video\nEric Romani, Audio\nJesse Wiza, Production\n\nMORE FROM THIS SESSION\nThe Raven: https://youtu.be/bJnsD9uK5ag\nIt Just Doesn't Happen: https://youtu.be/n1RmNv-nnYc\n\n#Indie #SingerSongwriter #Destroyer", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9GEMpHjwy8", "date_published": "2020-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Destroyer - The Raven (Live at The Current)", "description": "Watch Destroyer - Dan Bejar and his band - play \"The Raven\" from the album 'Have We Met,' released January 31, 2020 on Merge Records and Dead Oceans.\n\n'Have We Met,'' despite Bejar's insistence on it maybe not being the best place to start in his discography, is a brilliant example of solidarity with the estrangement. It's cerebral, but accessible. Bejar has created a space for us to both laugh and cry about the state of the world.\n\nPERSONNEL\nDan Bejar, vocals\nDavid Carswell, guitar\nNicholas Bragg, guitar\nJoshua Wells, drums\nColin Cowan, bass\nTed Bois, keyboards\n\nCREDITS\nHelen Teague, Video\nEric Romani, Audio\nJesse Wiza, Production\n\nMORE FROM THIS SESSION\nThe Man in Black's Blues: https://youtu.be/R9GEMpHjwy8\nIt Just Doesn't Happen: https://youtu.be/n1RmNv-nnYc\n\n\n#Indie #singersongwriter #Destroyer", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJnsD9uK5ag", "date_published": "2020-03-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
