Every day, the "Boomer Rants in Woods" series and the scripting tutorials get closer to merging. In this video I talk about some Linux system basics, like where battery information is stored/revealed and how to easily access it. I show the script I use to display battery information in my statusbar.

Tick, tock, wagies! Having a hard time during lockdown in your cities? Can't pay yout $3,000 a month rent and $2,000 a month student loan debt? That's too bad. You should start living the /innawoods/ NEET way and making your own path away from the bugman city. I talk about ONE SIMPLE TRICK I remember whenever I make a life decision that always points you in the right direction.
