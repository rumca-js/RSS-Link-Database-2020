Players can use Immersive settings to do things such as limit their primary weapon to a single gun, reduce the number of bandages carried, drain stamina more quickly, and risk greater injury. The Ghost Experience also makes some big structural changes to the game, such as removing tiered loot, allowing players to scavenge guns off of enemies, and removing other random players from the social spaces. In this video we\u2019re going to go over what custom settings you can use to take the immersive experience even further.\n\nAlso included in this expansion is the Episode 2 Deep State DLC that sees players teaming back up with Sam Fisher who previously appeared in Ghost Recon Wildlands DLC. Breakpoint came out in 2019 and scored a 4/10 on GameSpot because in part loot and gear score didn\u2019t make sense, the survival mechanics were underdeveloped, enemy AI wasn't great, and the social hub seemed geared towards microtransactions. The Ghost Experience is the game's biggest initiative to date to tackle some of those initial problems\n\nGhost Recon Breakpoint is out for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. It\u2019s a cooperative open-world shooter where players take on Cole Walker, played by Jon Bernthal, as he uses an army of ex-military operators and drones to take over a remote island.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jcP5Tycw14", "date_published": "2020-03-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "How Animal Crossing Came From One Of Nintendo's Biggest Failures", "description": "Animal Crossing is an unconventional kind of game that is loved by many, but did you know that its origins lie in a failed piece of Nintendo hardware.\n\nYou may not remember it, but at one time the Nintendo 64 had an add-on peripheral called the 64DD. Before the end of its short lifespan, Nintendo designed a game about hanging out with cute animals in a single field and completing small tasks. That game was Animal Forest, better known today as Animal Crossing.\n\nThe beloved series has gone on to sell millions and is one of the most recognizable video game franchises around, but its inception lies in an ambitious and, ultimately, failed hardware project. In this video we take a look back at the origins of Animal Crossing, and tell the story of its unlikely beginnings, its almost demise, and its ultimate success.\n\n#AnimalCrossing #NewHorizons #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUJWSZGNqgI", "date_published": "2020-03-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "We Test Half-Life Alyx On Every Major VR Headset", "description": "What's the best VR headset to play Half-Life Alyx on?
