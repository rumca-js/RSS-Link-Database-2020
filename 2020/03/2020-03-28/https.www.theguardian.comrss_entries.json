But again, I was wrong. A few days later, Beard <a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\">devoted the blog she writes for the </a><em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\">Times Literary Supplement</a></em><a href=\"https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/how-do-we-review-television-intelligently/\" title=\"\"> to TV criticism</a>, having taken exception not only to my review, but to several others too. In it, she ticked each of us off individually. (Had I, she wanted to know, ever considered how few TV minutes in the past had been devoted to Zoffany\u2019s <em>Tribuna</em>?) She then called for a total rethink of TV criticism. It seems that Beard wants new, better TV critics, who will take a new, better approach to television. The inference is that what she really wants are TV critics who will universally praise everything that she does.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/28/rachel-cooke-on-criticism-what-is-the-point-of-a-critic-if-not-to-tell-the-truth\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/28/rachel-cooke-on-criticism-what-is-the-point-of-a-critic-if-not-to-tell-the-truth", "date_published": "2020-03-28 18:30:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "We must take drastic action but let\u2019s not turn into a nation of little tyrants", "description": "<p>Crisis measures often become permanent \u2013 it\u2019s up to us to ensure our democracy stays safe</p><p>Fear is pushing us into a dictatorial future.

The helicopters were out; what if they\u2019d seen it with their cameras, my mother said, and thought it was real? The scenario seemed unlikely to me: that a helicopter, thousands of feet up in the air, would spot a kid playing with a toy and send a patrol to our house.
