Tick, tock, wagies! Having a hard time during lockdown in your cities? Can't pay yout $3,000 a month rent and $2,000 a month student loan debt? That's too bad. You should start living the /innawoods/ NEET way and making your own path away from the bugman city. I talk about ONE SIMPLE TRICK I remember whenever I make a life decision that always points you in the right direction.

How do you set wallpapers in Linux? I show not just how I set them, but easy features to add that pick random wallpapers, change wallpapers persistently, generate color schemes from wall papers and even view wallpapers in a gallery for picking. It's way easier than you think if you just use command line tools instead of a silly gui walled garden! 😉 You can do a lot with xwallpaper!
