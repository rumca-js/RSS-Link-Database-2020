<p>The coronavirus pandemic is beginning to expose the fragility of our food system. But will we choose long-term solutions or short-term fixes?</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-live-news-update-us-infections-outnumber-china-uk-deaths-europe-global-cases-number-500000-latest-updates">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Until a couple of weeks ago, the idea of waiting in an Ocado queue of 73,735 shoppers, or of supermarkets rationing milk and baked beans, would have sounded like satire. For too many people in the UK, food scarcity is the norm, with mothers and fathers going hungry to ensure their children are fed. But others have grown used to an absurd abundance: strawberries and peaches in midwinter, or 20 types of mustard alongside three score of pasta. When such bounty overflows, it seems self-evident that supplies are both plentiful and reliable – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/millions-to-need-food-aid-in-days-as-virus-exposes-uk-supply" title="">until suddenly they aren’t</a>.</p><p>In fact, warns Tim Lang in his new book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis" title="">Feeding Britain</a>, our food system is “stretched, open to disruption and far from resilient”. It is easy to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/coronavirus-uk-panic-buyers-urged-to-think-of-frontline-workers" title="">castigate panic buyers</a> for empty shelves. But while shopping responsibly will help others to get the food they need, only a few people are squirrelling away vast stocks. Research firm Kantar says the average spend per supermarket trip has risen by 16% to £22.13 month on month – not surprising when households realised they were likely to need lunches at home, including for children no longer in school, and could have to self-isolate for a fortnight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/the-guardian-view-on-empty-supermarket-shelves-panic-is-not-the-problem">Continue reading...</a>

Since then, the UK government’s measures to give <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-uk-offers-self-employed-80-of-earnings">financial aid to the self-employed</a> will help the sector – but many are still deeply concerned about the lack of work available in the coming months. Here are some of the nearly 150 stories we received. Thanks to everyone who got in touch.</p><p><strong>Stephen Laughton, 38, playwright and TV writer<br /></strong>My play, One Jewish Boy, opened in the West End on 10 March – a huge step up for me. I had TV deals lined up, a movie deal on the cards, another play about to start in New York. The play managed to stay open for one week. It got us to press night, and much like its original fringe run, was a critical success – four and five stars, and that first week was packed out. It was the moment I’d been waiting for. But I knew what was coming – a moment I hoped I would cherish for ever was tinged with crushing defeat. It felt as if everything we had worked for – all the abuse (my play is about antisemitism and I was on the receiving end of a lot of it), all the hard work, the blood, joy, sweat and tears – just faded away. The next day it got worse: I didn’t quite take in the monumental loss of having every gig I had lined up, cancelled. In the short term, I’m pretty screwed, the financial loss from the cancellation of two plays, a TV and a film gig has hit the tens of thousands. That makes it sound as if I always earn at this level – I don’t and I haven’t. I’ve been working hand to mouth and now, when it looked as if I might finally be able to breathe, I don’t know when I’ll get paid again. I just need to find a way to keep my head above water.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-lockdown-affects-arts-workers">Continue reading...</a>

## 'We are all Edward Hopper paintings now': is he the artist of the coronavirus age?

But the pandemic has given his work a terrifying new significance</p><p>Who can fail to have been moved by all the images of people on their doorsteps clapping for the NHS last night? They filled TV screens and news websites, presenting a warming picture of solidarity in enforced solitude – all alone yet all together. But there are some far less reassuring images circulating on social media. Some people are saying we now all exist inside an Edward Hopper painting. It doesn’t seem to matter which one.</p><p>I assume this is because we are coldly distanced from each other, sitting at our lonely windows overlooking an eerily empty city, like the woman perched on her bed in Morning Sun, or the other looking out of a bay window in Cape Cod Morning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/27/we-are-all-edward-hopper-paintings-now-artist-coronavirus-age">Continue reading...</a>

## Living bridges and supper from sewage: can ancient fixes save our crisis-torn world?

<p>From underground aqueducts to tree-bridges and fish that love sewage, indigenous customs could save the planet – but are under threat. Landscape architect Julia Watson shares her ‘lo-TEK’ vision</p><p>On the eastern edge of Kolkata, near the smoking mountain of the city’s garbage dump, the 15 million-strong metropolis dissolves into a watery landscape of channels and lagoons, ribboned by highways. This patchwork of ponds might seem like an unlikely place to find <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jan/25/kolkata-west-bengal-india-cites-fish-farming-sewage-food-demand-real-estate">inspiration for the future of sustainable cities</a>, but that’s exactly what Julia Watson sees in the marshy muddle.<br /><br />The network of pools, she explains, are <em>bheris</em>, shallow, flat-bottomed fish ponds that are fed by 700m litres of raw sewage every day – half the city’s output. The ponds produce 13,000 tonnes of fish each year. But the system, which has been operating for a century, doesn’t just produce a huge amount of fish – it treats the city’s wastewater, fertilises nearby rice fields, and employs 80,000 fishermen within a cooperative.</p><p>Watson, a landscape architect, says it saves around $22m (£18m) a year on the cost of a conventional wastewater treatment plant, while cutting down on transport, as the fish are sold in local markets. “It is the perfect symbiotic solution,” she says. “It operates entirely without chemicals, seeing fish, algae and bacteria working together to form a sustainable, ecologically balanced engine for the city.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/27/lo-tek-living-bridges-fish-sewage-ancient-fixes-crisis-world">Continue reading...</a>

## Let’s move to Linlithgow, West Lothian: Silicon Glen capital with a regal past

<p>There’s still romance here, but the seat of monarchs has given way to humble, suburban dreams</p><p><strong>What’s going for it?</strong> Linlithgow wears its 21st-century role as a commuter town in the sweet spot between Edinburgh and Glasgow in the way a megastar of stage or screen might – someone who, in later life, has had cause to stack shelves in Lidl. Nothing wrong with stacking shelves or, indeed, Lidl. But Linlithgow has known grander times. This, I’ll have you know, is the Royal Burgh of Linlithgow, and it has the palace to prove it, ta-dah on its hilltop pedestal, as if anyone could ignore it. Don’t you know who I was? True, the palace lacks a roof these days. Yet this palace gave birth to Mary, Queen of Scots. This palace was the centre of the Stuart dynasty. This palace’s fountain once flowed with wine, it’s said, for the marriage of James V and Mary of Guise. Still, those days have long gone. Although there’s romance still in its polished old streets, today it’s a romance designed, not as a stage set for monarchy, political intrigue and government, but for more humble, suburban dreams, and propping up house prices. Linlithgow has grown accustomed to its new role: capital of Silicon Glen, Queen of Middle Scotland, provider of comfy sofas and Netflix<strong> </strong>filming locations to the strivers of Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p><p><strong>The case against…</strong> It’s a small town of commuters: kids and beatniks will want to escape – though worry not, the fleshpots of Edinburgh and Glasgow are nearby. It’s a victim of its own popularity: traffic, parking, house prices and oversubscribed schools.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/27/lets-move-to-linlithgow-west-lothian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You need to actively listen to each other’s fears. Compromise is the best way forward, says Annalisa Barbieri</p><p><strong>My husband and I both have fertility issues and underwent IVF. We were lucky to conceive our child (who is now </strong><strong>one) on the first attempt; it was a complicated, high-risk pregnancy. After the birth I had some health issues, including post</strong><strong>natal depression (PND), but </strong><strong>have now recovered. I think my husband found </strong><strong>this much more stressful than I did.</strong></p><p><strong>We originally </strong><strong>wanted </strong><strong>two or three children. Before beginning IVF, we agreed </strong><strong>to use all the embryos from the cycle. However, he now says that he thought we</strong><strong> agreed to use all the embryos until we had a child, then decide what to do with any that </strong><strong>were left (I believe this may be a genuine miscommunication).</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/27/my-husband-and-i-cant-agree-future-after-ivf-ask-annalisa-barbieri">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He found fame as Baldrick in Blackadder but Tony Robinson is equally proud of his documentary work. With a new series celebrating global train travel, he reflects on lockdown, his socialist beliefs and why he doesn’t miss acting</p><p>Three weeks ago, Tony Robinson completed a six-part series for Channel 5 – it starts tonight – charting a journey that took him around the world by train. Now, like the rest of us, he is being told not to walk to the end of the street. We were due to meet face to face for this interview, but we have to talk by phone instead. The upside is we have all the time in the world. “I’m one of those people who a few weeks ago would have looked at my watch and said: ‘Is 10 minutes all right?’” he says. “But now …” He trails off. Everything has been cancelled: shooting on two other series; preparing a pitch for a third. What had been a crowded diary is empty.<br /><br />“All my performance work went in one day,” he says. “Had that happened at another time I would have been so pissed off you can’t imagine. But when it’s happening to everybody, you just think: ‘Oh, this is the way life is now.’” What did annoy him was that some of those postponing projects thought his age – he is 73 – might mean he couldn’t resume them in the future. “That was distressing,” he says. “It’s just old-fashioned ageism.”<br /><br />What is filling his life instead is a six-year-old west highland terrier he and his wife Louise have just brought back from an RSPCA rescue centre in Derby. “It was probably our last long car journey for a year. Who knows?” he says. “She’s called Holly Berry and our flat [in west London] is full of joy. She’s had a gruelling life and it’s nice to pour our interest into an animal whose confidence is growing by the day.”<br /><br />Robinson is an obsessive worker, a fact obvious from a CV that encompasses acting, presenting, writing (TV series, children’s books, an autobiography) and politics – he was on Labour’s National Executive Committee from 2000 to 2004. He says he will carry on writing during the crisis, but also looks forward to spending more time with his wife and will “tidy drawers that haven’t been tidied for at least seven years”.<br /><br />Fortunately, the series for Channel 5 survived the lockdown. He travels across southern Europe, glories in the street life of South America, takes a train through Mexico and California, explores Canada and heads home via Russia and Scandinavia. It is an epic undertaking, conducted at whistlestop speed, and there are times when he looks knackered.<br /><br />“It’s a celebration of life, a celebration of other people, a celebration of the world and of adventure,” he says. “Everything is so gloomy at the moment, but I was doing the final voiceover at a time when we could just explode with fun and laughter and my idiocy in the face of adversity, and we need to hold on to that. There’s a limited amount of time during which we can mourn what’s going to happen.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/27/tony-robinson-sitting-at-home-now-we-have-the-luxury-of-reinventing-everything">Continue reading...</a>

After a university professor calls a group of his female students “giggling sluts” IRL, the online reaction snowballs. The student feminist society takes a stand, followed by the inevitable backlash. A male would-be ally cries, “Not all men” and a spurned loner turns to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/raw-hatred-why-incel-movement-targets-terrorises-women">incel</a> and “alt-right” rhetoric.

<p>The political interviewer on how he made it in the US and his anger at the deference the media has for Donald Trump which could cost lives during the pandemic<br /></p><p>‘We all know that the president is a pathological liar,” Mehdi Hasan says from his office in Washington DC. “But the lies he’s been telling about the coronavirus – they’re no joke; they cost American lives. The US media’s failure to call Donald Trump out on those lies in real time makes part of the media, I’m sorry to say, partly complicit in those deaths, too.” Hasan, who moved from the UK to the US in 2015, is that rare species of TV interviewer: not in it to make friends, to network or to gain access. His passion for grilling his subjects is only matched by his frustration at his peers who do not do the same.</p><p>When the White House press corps <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/apr/29/white-house-correspondents-dinner-michelle-wolf-stuns-media-with-sarah-sanders-attack">turned on the comedian Michelle Wolf</a> after the 2018 White House correspondents’ dinner and defended Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, it was the last straw for him.

In ordinary times, I’d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I’d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I’d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated <a href="https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/" title="">containment </a><a href="https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/" title="">level 3</a>, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney’s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed; the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be “of the type used in the nuclear industry”; a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.</p><p>But Heeney couldn’t take the risk. Understandably, he didn’t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. “It’s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don’t know who they’re passing on the bus or the train,” he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. “I don’t have time to get sick,” Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University’s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He’s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

## Coronavirus has not suspended politics – it has revealed the nature of power | David Runciman

<p>In a lockdown, we can see the essence of politics is still what Hobbes described: some people get to tell others what to do</p><p>We keep hearing that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/we-are-at-war-coronavirus-pandemic">this is a war</a>. Is it really? What helps to give the current crisis its wartime feel is the apparent absence of normal political argument. The prime minister <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police">goes on TV</a> to issue a sombre statement to the nation about the curtailment of our liberties and the leader of the opposition offers nothing but support. Parliament, insofar as it is able to operate at all, appears to be merely going through the motions. People are stuck at home, and their fights are limited to the domestic sphere. There is talk of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives">government of national unity</a>. Politics-as-usual has gone missing.</p><p>But this is not the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-parliament-to-close-early-for-easter-amid-coronavirus-fears">suspension of politics</a>. It is the stripping away of one layer of political life to reveal something more raw underneath. In a democracy we tend to think of politics as a contest between different parties for our support. We focus on the who and the what of political life: who is after our votes, what they are offering us, who stands to benefit. We see elections as the way to settle these arguments. But the bigger questions in any democracy are always about the how: how will governments exercise the extraordinary powers we give them? And how will we respond when they do?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-politics-lockdown-hobbes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bacterium is able to break down polyurethane, which is widely used but rarely recycled</p><p>A bacterium that feeds on toxic plastic has been discovered by scientists. The bug not only breaks the plastic down but uses it as food to power the process.</p><p>The bacterium, which was found at a waste site where plastic had been dumped, is the first that is known to attack polyurethane. Millions of tonnes of the plastic is produced every year to use in items such as sports shoes, nappies, kitchen sponges and as foam insulation, but it is mostly sent to landfill because it it too tough to recycle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/scientists-find-bug-that-feasts-on-toxic-plastic">Continue reading...</a>
