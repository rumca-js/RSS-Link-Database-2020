Thanks to everyone who got in touch.</p><p><strong>Stephen Laughton, 38, playwright and TV writer<br /></strong>My play, One Jewish Boy, opened in the West End on 10 March \u2013 a huge step up for me. I had TV deals lined up, a movie deal on the cards, another play about to start in New York. The play managed to stay open for one week. It got us to press night, and much like its original fringe run, was a critical success \u2013 four and five stars, and that first week was packed out. It was the moment I\u2019d been waiting for. But I knew what was coming \u2013 a moment I hoped I would cherish for ever was tinged with crushing defeat. It felt as if everything we had worked for \u2013 all the abuse (my play is about antisemitism and I was on the receiving end of a lot of it), all the hard work, the blood, joy, sweat and tears \u2013 just faded away. The next day it got worse: I didn\u2019t quite take in the monumental loss of having every gig I had lined up, cancelled. In the short term, I\u2019m pretty screwed, the financial loss from the cancellation of two plays, a TV and a film gig has hit the tens of thousands. That makes it sound as if I always earn at this level \u2013 I don\u2019t and I haven\u2019t. I\u2019ve been working hand to mouth and now, when it looked as if I might finally be able to breathe, I don\u2019t know when I\u2019ll get paid again. I just need to find a way to keep my head above water.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-lockdown-affects-arts-workers\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-lockdown-affects-arts-workers", "date_published": "2020-03-27 17:39:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Brazil scales back environmental enforcement amid coronavirus outbreak", "description": "<p>Experts fear efforts to protect field agents from virus could lead to surge in deforestation </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Brazil will reduce efforts to fight environmental crimes during the coronavirus outbreak, despite concerns that reduced protection could lead to a surge in deforestation.</p><p>The director of environmental protection at Ibama environmental agency said the outbreak had left little choice but to send fewer enforcement personnel into the field.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/brazil-scales-back-environmental-enforcement-coronavirus-outbreak-deforestation\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/brazil-scales-back-environmental-enforcement-coronavirus-outbreak-deforestation", "date_published": "2020-03-27 17:37:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Jamaican reggae vocalist Bob Andy dies aged 75", "description": "<p>Socially conscious singer\u2019s hit version of Young, Gifted and Black reached No 5 in the UK charts with duo Bob and Marcia</p><p>Bob Andy, the reggae vocalist who performed a hit version of Young, Gifted and Black as part of the duo Bob and Marcia, has died aged 75 after a short illness.</p><p>His death was confirmed by his collaborator on that song, Marcia Griffiths, who told the Jamaica Observer he died at 8am on Friday 27 March.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/jamaican-reggae-vocalist-bob-andy-dies-aged-75-young-gifted-black\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/jamaican-reggae-vocalist-bob-andy-dies-aged-75-young-gifted-black", "date_published": "2020-03-27 17:28:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Trump's narcissism has taken a new twist.

In ordinary times, I\u2019d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I\u2019d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I\u2019d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated <a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">containment </a><a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">level 3</a>, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney\u2019s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed; the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be \u201cof the type used in the nuclear industry\u201d; a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.</p><p>But Heeney couldn\u2019t take the risk. Understandably, he didn\u2019t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don\u2019t know who they\u2019re passing on the bus or the train,\u201d he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to get sick,\u201d Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University\u2019s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He\u2019s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19", "date_published": "2020-03-27 06:00:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus has not suspended politics \u2013\u00a0it has revealed the nature of power | David Runciman", "description": "<p>In a lockdown, we can see the essence of politics is still what Hobbes described: some people get to tell others what to do</p><p>We keep hearing that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/we-are-at-war-coronavirus-pandemic\">this is a war</a>. Is it really? What helps to give the current crisis its wartime feel is the apparent absence of normal political argument. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/boris-johnson-orders-uk-lockdown-to-be-enforced-by-police\">goes on TV</a> to issue a sombre statement to the nation about the curtailment of our liberties and the leader of the opposition offers nothing but support. Parliament, insofar as it is able to operate at all, appears to be merely going through the motions. People are stuck at home, and their fights are limited to the domestic sphere. There is talk of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/covid-coalition-government-considered-by-senior-conservatives\">government of national unity</a>.

It is the stripping away of one layer of political life to reveal something more raw underneath. In a democracy we tend to think of politics as a contest between different parties for our support. We focus on the who and the what of political life: who is after our votes, what they are offering us, who stands to benefit. We see elections as the way to settle these arguments. But the bigger questions in any democracy are always about the how: how will governments exercise the extraordinary powers we give them? And how will we respond when they do?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-politics-lockdown-hobbes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-politics-lockdown-hobbes", "date_published": "2020-03-27 06:00:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "US surpasses China for highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world", "description": "<p>During a press briefing, Donald Trump said the dates for reopening sections of the country were under discussion</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/us-politics-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 live US updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Live global updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Donald Trump again struggled to reassure a fearful nation on Thursday as it emerged the US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.</p><p>News that America had surpassed virus hotspots China and Italy with 82,404 cases of infection, according to a tracker run by <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University</a>, broke as the president was holding a press conference at the White House.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump", "date_published": "2020-03-27 05:47:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Scientists find bug that feasts on toxic plastic", "description": "<p>Bacterium is able to break down polyurethane, which is widely used but rarely recycled</p><p>A bacterium that feeds on toxic plastic has been discovered by scientists.
