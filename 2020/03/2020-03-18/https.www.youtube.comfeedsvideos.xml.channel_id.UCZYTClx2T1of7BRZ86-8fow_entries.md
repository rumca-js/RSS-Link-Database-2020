Thank you to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for partnering with us on this episode of SciShow. Visit https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/visit/exhibits/sea-otters/meet-our-otters to learn more about the Sea Otter Program. 

Did you know that some species take care of young that are not their own? This surprising practice is called alloparenting, and itâ€™s been observed in animals from otters, like Rosa and Selka, to birds to baboons! 

Following state recommendations to help slow the spread of COVID-19, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is temporarily closed. Their team is doing their best to bring you the Aquarium remotely. If you're looking for a moment of calm, we recommend tuning in to some of their live stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/MontereyBayAquarium/videos?view=2&sort=dd&live_view=501&shelf_id=18

Olympic National Park is temporarily closed as Washington, the US, and the world work to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. We filmed this series in early January and are currently at home practicing social distancing. We hope you and your community of friends and family are staying healthy as we work to #flattenthecurve.

Our road trip through Olympic National Park continues! This week, Stefan and Alexis are headed to Ruby Beach to find out how its famous sea stacks formed.
