<p>I was in the stadium to see Luis Suárez break Ghanaian hearts with his handball. It was cheating, but also an understandable act of self-sacrifice</p><p>Almost a decade on, the 2010 World Cup is recalled as a tournament of low-scoring matches, played out amid the distracting honk of vuvuzelas. As is usually the case, the host showed its best and most welcoming side, rendering happy memories to its visitors only to leave a disappointing legacy for South Africa itself.<br /><br />Every tournament, though, will throw up at least one segue of incredible drama, of unlikely and since-forgotten heroes, skulduggery from villains and adrenaline-surging plot twists. The rest of the quarter-final between Ghana and Uruguay was decent enough. The climax to the 120 minutes made the night unforgettable.</p><p>Fine goals were scored by Sulley Muntari and Diego Forlán, but it was not a classic, in keeping with much of the rest of the fare on show during that 30 days. Luis Suárez’s handball, and the subsequent penalty drama, meant it ended up as a tale of the bad guys running off into the sunset, chortling at their ill-gotten gains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/18/my-favourite-game-uruguay-v-ghana-world-cup-2010-quarter-final">Continue reading...</a>

## Untold Night and Day by Bae Suah review – surrealism in Seoul

A haunting and dreamlike wander through the intricacies of Korean society by a radical and prize-winning author<p>Born in Seoul in 1965, Bae Suah is one of Korea’s most radical contemporary writers, whose prolific output has won prizes and acclaim both within her home country and abroad. Her fiction is notable for its surrealism, sudden shifts in chronology and lyrical intensity of language, a style no doubt influenced by her translation of writers such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/dec/17/guardianobituaries.books1" title="">WG Sebald</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/22/book-disquiet-fernando-pessoa-lezard" title="">Fernando Pessoa</a>. One Korean reviewer described Bae’s early novel <em>A Greater Music</em> as “doing violence to the Korean language”: it was this particular line that attracted Deborah Smith, translator of the Booker International prize-winning author <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/17/han-kang-white-book-meet-the-author" title="">Han Kang</a>, to Bae’s subversive writing. <em>Untold Night and Day</em>, translated by Smith, marks the arrival of her heady fiction in the UK for the first time.</p><p>The novel begins with Ayami’s last shift working at Seoul’s only audio-theatre for the visually impaired, where she is worrying about the cryptic “sound shadow” emitting from one of the theatre’s radios, which keeps turning on and off. An elderly couple walk past the theatre, lamenting its closure, and Ayami wonders if they might be her parents. Later, an agitated man, with “desert-dry gunmetal skin”, threatens to kill Ayami before he is removed by two security guards. Ayami recognises the man but she no longer trusts her own memory: she overhears faraway conversations that should not be audible; she lipreads a man she cannot see.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/18/untold-night-and-day-bae-suah-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dog training is a complex, time-consuming art – and now that CGI can replace them, the canine characters are increasingly outsourced. At what cost?</p><p>An old man and a dog sit on the moss-covered roof of a log cabin in the Canadian wilderness. It is a warm summer’s night – a river gurgles nearby. The man, named Thornton, and the dog, named Buck, have been on a long journey to reach this bucolic splendor, a journey that is now coming to an end. Buck has met a pack of wolves in the forest and is overcome by a primal urge to rejoin his ancestors. Thornton is despondent at the prospect of losing his friend. So, in one final act of submission, Buck nestles into Thornton’s lap, before he turns his back on domestication and returns to his own kind.</p><p>This is a scene in the recent cinematic remake of Jack London’s 1903 novel The Call of the Wild, which tracks the journey of Buck, a highborn St Bernard collie cross. There have been several attempts at reimagining this tale in film: in 1935, a hulking St Bernard starred alongside Clark Gable in the first movie version of the novel. In 1972, Charlton Heston shared the screen with Buck the leonberger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/18/dog-actors-replaced-cgi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They were bold, badass – and brief. But Batman’s short-lived female sidekicks give us hope that women in comics are good for more than just sticking in a fridge</p><p>Eighty years ago, Robin – perhaps the most iconic sidekick of all time, the “boy wonder”, the cheery presence at Batman’s brooding side – literally burst onto the scene on the cover of Detective Comics #38.</p><p>The first character to become Robin, Dick Grayson, defined the sidekick as we know him now, in his 44 years in the role: the endless puns and exclamations of “Holy … !”; the red, green and yellow tunic with a scaly speedo and pixie boots; the dependable pluckiness. His successor, Jason Todd, brought an edge to Robin when he took over in 1983: openly rebellious against Batman, he became the first Robin to die on the job. The third, Tim Drake, brought the character into the modern age in the 90s, with a new and bold “R” on his chest, hacking skills, and, at long last, some trousers; Drake was popular enough to land a solo series. In 2006, the fourth and current Robin, Damian Wayne, flipped the Dynamic Duo’s dynamic: after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/nov/27/batman-rip-grant-morrison">his father Bruce </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/nov/27/batman-rip-grant-morrison">died</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/nov/27/batman-rip-grant-morrison"> (sort of)</a>, Damian became a dark and angry sidekick to a lighter, jokey Batman as Dick Grayson – the original Robin – wore the cowl. Damian would also later die – but, like Jason, his father and so many superheroes, he was resurrected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/18/80-years-of-robin-the-forgotten-history-of-the-most-iconic-sidekick">Continue reading...</a>
