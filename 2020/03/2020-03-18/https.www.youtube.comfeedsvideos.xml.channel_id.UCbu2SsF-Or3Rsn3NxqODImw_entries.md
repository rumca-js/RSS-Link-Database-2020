The beta for Call of Duty: Warzone is now in full swing--expect our full review on it soon. In the meantime, if you're struggling to get a handle on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare's battle royale mode--whether you're playing in three-person squads or solo--we've got some tips and tricks that will help make you a better player.

In the video above, Richie Bracamonte details eight ways you can improve your game in Warzone. Though many of the tips are squad-focused, a few will apply to you whether you prefer to play within a team or on your own. Helping your squad survive the Gulag isn't something you can do on your own, as an obvious example, but utilizing methods to fall faster or swapping vehicle seats while driving to dodge bullets is helpful regardless of whether you're playing three-person squad or solo. 

On its own, Warzone is free but a massive download--that said, it also comes as a much smaller download for those who own Modern Warfare. If you're stuck at home via social isolation on account of the coronavirus, picking up Modern Warfare and partying up with some friends may be a fun way to pass the time. In GameSpot's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare review, Kallie Plagge wrote, "Just when it could really make a point about any other aspect of modern war, it pulls back. Modern Warfare makes old observations and presents them with new flourishes. Those new flourishes do make for a good campaign and solid multiplayer. But it's when Modern Warfare asks you to think harder that it falls short."

## Doom Eternal Nightmare Difficulty With No HUD Is Beautiful Madness

In a horrific, gory and violent way, Doom Eternal is a beautiful game. Of course, it can be difficult to really soak it in when you're leaping around hellscapes tearing demons to pieces and filling them with bullets. So, to help encourage a little more sightseeing so we can properly appreciate the hellish aesthetics, we've done away with the HUD. And, to add a little extra challenge, we're playing Nightmare mode. Why? Because we want to test our mettle and in the most metal game around. 

But also because it's an interesting and different way to play id Software's latest shooter. And it turns out playing this way actually taught me a lot about the game. There are a lot of small touches I hadn’t noticed in my first run through but, without a HUD to rely on, they became crucial to keeping the Doom Slayer alive. 

In the above video you can see me struggle against what is an extremely cinematic, but extremely punishing way to experience Doom Eternal.

In lieu of a traditional GDC talk, PS5 lead architect Mark Cerny presented some of the next-gen console's key specs on a livestream. While the talk did include a lot of jargon, there are some key takeaways for gamers to note.

For one, backwards compatibility is a priority for Sony. You'll be able to play PS4's most popular games at launch; nearly 100 titles will be playable out of the box. The PS5 also sports proprietary 3D audio tech, meaning you'll be able to hear that horror monster coming up behind you and identify the source of the sound.

These are just two of the takeaways noted in the video above. Of course, we still have lingering questions about the console's look and price. That said, the PS5's targeted release date is still holiday 2020.

## Doom Eternal - Gnarliest, Goriest, And Most Brutal Kills

See the Doom Slayer rip and tear through his foes at his most violent by watching the best finishers Doom Eternal has to offer.

Blood, guts, and gnarly destruction are the cornerstone of Doom. Anyone that has played the 2016 Doom reboot will know that id Software pushed the beloved first-person shooter franchise to its extremes with that game. The developer delivers an experience that will undoubtedly be remembered as one of the most metal video games ever. For the sequel, however, it is--excuse the cliche--turning things up to 11. 

Doom Eternal is bigger and more outrageous in every way. As the Doom Slayer, you'll be ripping and tearing your way through the demonic hordes with savage efficiency. The latest Doom games are all about momentum, with players moving around battle arenas unloading bullet after bullet, shell after shell, and rocket after rocket into their enemies, stopping only to tear them to pieces with their bare hands. And the result is a firework show of lead, fire, blood, and guts. 

In Eternal, you'll see more of that and and, for fans of ludicrously over the top violence against virtual hellspawn, it's a glorious sight to behold. We've put together a highlight reel of the gnarliest, gories, and most brutal kills. Bear witness to the destructive power of the Doom Slayer.
