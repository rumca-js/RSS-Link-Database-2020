Join the fun as we watch the 1985 Soviet adaptation of The Hobbit.  See how this stacks up - or doesn't - to the Peter Jackson version!  I'll be reacting live, give some background info on this production, and be live chatting with you throughout the screening.  Make sure you subscribe and set the reminder so you don't miss it!  Thanks for helping Nerd of the Rings hit 1000 subscribers so quickly!
