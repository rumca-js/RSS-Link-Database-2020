Note: This isn't a Vox Borders episode, and it's in no way affiliated with Vox.com. This was just a fun little video I made on my own during a vacation to Vancouver, and nowhere near the depth and effort that goes into a Vox Borders episode. I'm still deep in production, working on Borders USA (spoiler alert: it's gonna be good!).
