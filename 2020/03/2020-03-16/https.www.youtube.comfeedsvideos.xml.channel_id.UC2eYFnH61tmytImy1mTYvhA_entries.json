That would be okay in this case, but I didn't do it here because I'm thinking about adding more. Then again, we'll see how the script evolves.\n\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\r\nDONATE NOW: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrUW14L_uqE", "date_published": "2020-03-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA", "title": "Time to RESTART my Entire Channel!", "description": "WEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\r\nDONATE NOW: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OlRhuNX_K0", "date_published": "2020-03-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
