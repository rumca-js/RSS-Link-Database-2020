<p>The imminent financial turmoil is likely to exploited by those who already have most of the power and money<br /></p><p>You may have heard about the 13‑year‑old schoolboy from Leeds called Oliver Cooper who, it has been reported, was sent home after selling precious squirts of hand sanitiser for 50p each. Cooper’s scheme was rumbled when he recklessly tried to sell a squirt to one of his teachers, although not before he had made £9: a windfall that, according to his mother, is being invested in “a multipack of Doritos” and “a kebab”.</p><p>All good clean fun and on reflection almost certainly one of those stories that has been trumped up for the benefit of the gullible internet. But a reminder, too, that even in the thick of a crisis there will always be a few with an eye on the main chance, who in the words of the investor Warren Buffett are prepared to “be greedy when others are fearful”. At a time when it feels like the very terms of our lives are being renegotiated by the day, we should be vigilant of those who see in the crumbling of our social and economic norms an unprecedented opportunity to advance ideas that may, in less turbulent times, be taboo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/16/beware-sporting-disaster-capitalists-crisis-go-to-waste">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What’s the best way to keep your meals varied and interesting? Chefs and food writers on their store cupboard essentials</p><p>Judging by the empty shelves in supermarkets, many of us are planning to spend the next four months living on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/oct/03/recipe-felicity-cloake-perfect-pasta-pomodoro" title="">pasta al pomodoro</a>. Delicious as that is, stock your cupboards with a little more thought – and much more variety (no stockpiling here) – and you will thank yourself later, lockdown or not.</p><p>Not that I’m knocking the comforting properties of carbs. Rice of all kinds is incredibly versatile; basmati may not be the traditional choice for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/06/how-to-make-perfect-risotto" title="">risotto</a>, egg-fried rice or <a href="https://www.deliaonline.com/recipes/meals-and-courses/desserts/old-fashioned-rice-pudding" title="">rice pudding</a>, for example, but it will still be delicious if you can’t get other varieties. Couscous, polenta, noodles and bulgar wheat are all helpful to have around, and you might like to freeze a sliced loaf, or buy the ingredients to make your own bread. The Indian chef Maunika Gowardhan says she is never without atta flour for roti and parathas, while the author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/mar/23/black-sea-coast-turkey-food-drink-mountains-trabzon" title="">Black Sea</a>, Caroline Eden, recommends oatcakes.

<p>Sanders attacked some of Biden’s weak spots, but not strongly enough to make a difference</p><p>A stark contrast was on display on Sunday night, and both candidates on the Democratic debate stage knew it. Though Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were united in their criticism of Donald Trump’s response to coronavirus, they clashed repeatedly on policy issues, and even their core messages on the virus were very different.</p><p>For Biden, coronavirus is an isolated “national emergency” that needs to be dealt with before moving on to issues like poverty, minimum wages and the reform of the health insurance system. For Sanders, these issues are inextricably tied to the coronavirus emergency, because they exacerbate the suffering that comes during an epidemic. Sanders believes the spread of the virus is exposing deep systemic problems in the United States: the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/15/fears-mount-about-impact-coronavirus-homeless/">homelessness crisis</a>, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/half-of-americans-cant-afford-coronavirus-treatment-costs-2020-3">need for single payer free-at-point-of-use healthcare</a>, the precariousness of employment and the <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/03/15/opinion/coronavirus-bill-includes-sick-leave-not-gig-workers/">lack of paid sick leave</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/bernie-sanders-lost-his-last-chance-to-take-joe-biden-down">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We’ve reached a point where we can talk more openly about periods and menopause, but why not our pelvic floors? Nicola Down thinks it’s time for women to appreciate their secret weapon – and start a pelvic floor revolution</p><p>When it comes to exercise, we all know about bottom-sculpting squats, leg- strengthening lunges, and arm-toning lifts. And why wouldn’t we? After all, these exercises focus on our “mirror muscles” – you know, the ones we see when we look in the mirror. But what about those quick pelvic floor exercises that strengthen muscles you <em>don’t</em> see? You do those too, right? Well, it’s fair to say that, like ironing bed linen, it doesn’t seem worth the bother. For some reason, it’s always seemed a bit extra to be exercising muscles you can’t see, hoping, somehow, it’ll benefit you in a way you’re unsure about.</p><p>But the truth is that we need to look after all aspects of our fitness – and this includes muscles we can’t see but totally and utterly rely on. “Pelvic floors become a hot topic in pregnancy when women are told to do their exercises and later in life when there can be more continence issues, but it appears that often the understanding of the pelvic floor stops here,” says Rochelle Herz, a physiotherapist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-taboo/2020/mar/16/why-looking-after-your-pelvic-floor-is-one-of-the-most-radical-forms-of-self-care-going">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Maritozzi are a naughty-but-nice Roman cream bun typically made for Lent – tempting enough to satisfy those cravings without being too sinful</p><p>Rome is quiet. Tourists are keeping away and Romans, pragmatic by nature, are lying low. If, as I did, you happen to find yourself at the Sistine Chapel, it isn’t just the ceiling that is a marvel, but the fact that you can see every single tile on the mosaic floor. Being well-stocked with pasta and hand gel is a way of life here already, so little change there. The men selling garlic at the market are more in demand than usual, and children are diligently counting to 20 while they wash their hands and doing the dab when they sneeze. Schools and universities are now closed for 15 days – a precaution for Lent.</p><p>Also in the Vatican, I saw various portraits of Pope Gregory, the great architect, circa 600AD, of the eventual split between the patriarchs of Constantinople and the bishop of Rome. Elisabeth Luard writes in her exceptional book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20995926-seasonal-european-dishes" title="">Seasonal European Dishes</a>, that it was Gregory who decreed Lent to be a total fast until sundown, with no meat or dairy products to be taken during the 40-day fasting period. Later popes were more or less strict according to the period. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/16/rachel-roddy-maritozzi-cream-buns-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Pitlochry Festival theatre<br /></strong>Jessica Hardwick and Olivier Huband are compelling as a young couple facing harsh realities once their honeymoon ends</p><p>It’s the second half of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/neil-simon">Neil Simon</a>’s comedy when things kick off. After the sweet-tempered wisecracks before the interval, the mood has turned sour. Corie and Paul are newlyweds and their six-day marriage is faltering. In Elizabeth Newman’s production, the two of them circle each other in a ferocious dance across Adrian Rees’s set (all 1960s pastel pink, yellow and turquoise with a backdrop of West Side Story fire escapes).</p><p>With the stakes high, they are riveting to watch. As Corie, Jessica Hardwick represents the heart: fast, mercurial and emotionally intelligent. She orbits Olivier Huband’s Paul like only polar opposites can, her magnetic pull as powerful as her furious realisation that she has married a stuffed shirt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/16/barefoot-in-the-park-review-pitlochry-festival-theatre-neil-simon">Continue reading...</a>

## #Notmymermaid: the Disney row is ridiculous – who knows what mermaids look like?

<p>The backlash against a black Little Mermaid was instantaneous and ugly. But dark-skinned water goddesses swam in our imaginations long before Ariel</p><p>In July, 2019, Disney announced that R&amp;B singer and actor Halle Bailey would play Ariel in the live action remake of their hugely successful 1989 film,<em> The Little Mermaid</em>. Sadly, and predictably, there was a backlash against this casting choice. Many fans of the original Disney film could see no other mermaid than a pale-skinned one with red hair. Much ugliness ensued, especially online, from the hashtag #notmymermaid to petitions claiming that a black mermaid was “a betrayal of Ariel’s original creator”. Bailey kept quiet, before eventually releasing a statement saying, “I am beginning to understand this film is something so much bigger than me.”</p><p>Indeed. We’ve been dreaming up and writing about mermaids – pre-Christian water goddesses – for thousands of years, but it is notable that one of the first of these folkloric creatures to be written about was a black mermaid. Atargatis was an Assyrian goddess who had a human lover called Hadad, a shepherd, whom she killed by accident. The legends vary on how this happened, but the one I like most is that she overwhelmed him with her powerful lovemaking. They had a child together but so bereft was Atargatis at the death of her lover that she tried to drown herself in a lake. The Gods saved her by turning her into a mermaid.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/16/disney-notmymermaid-row-ridiculous">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ru finally adresses the Sherry shaped elephant in the room, and the runway theme continues to bemuse<br /></p><p>After TWO premieres and TWO casts, it’s the bit we’ve been waiting for – the queens meet. Let the backhanded compliments and thinly veiled nastiness ensue. It’s ALMOST as good as that bit in Four In A Bed where they’re forced to explain to each other’s faces why they underpaid by £3.50. Almost, but not quite (“I just really felt the poached eggs weren’t up to scratch and also we found a pubic hair under the kettle”).</p><p>This one also kicks off with a written statement addressing Sherry Pie-gate. It explains that they’ve decided, for the sake of the other queens, to proceed as planned, and that Sherry has been disqualified from the competition. It is on screen for a full 14 seconds. Which doesn’t sound like very long, but on a show that’s edited with roughly the same poise and coherence as a hungover oyster, a silent pause like this stands out and has an impact. They really want you to know that Sherry Pie will most certainly not be passing go, and absolutely will not be collecting ONEHUNDREDTHOUSANDDOOOOLLARS.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/16/rupauls-drag-race-recap-season-12-episode-three">Continue reading...</a>

A timely, clever analysis of why Shakespeare continues to cast a spell over American politics<p>The readiness is all. Ever since president John Adams rewrote a passage from <em>Henry V</em> to demonstrate how a foreign power might conspire to place a more pliable president in the White House, Shakespeare’s plays have been at the heart of America’s debate about itself.</p><p>Today, with the United States more disrupted than ever, and with a make-or-break election looming, Prof Shapiro, the author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/jun/05/biography.shakespeare" title=""><em>1599: A Year in the life of William Shakespeare</em></a>, is once again right on the money. He has plunged fearlessly into the enthralling afterlife of the <em>Complete Works</em> to examine the strange and potent dialogue between Shakespeare’s 400-year-old theatre and the drama of contemporary American politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/16/shakespeare-in-a-divided-america-james-shapiro-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Batman to Vin Diesel, the muscle car is the go-to ride for macho stars.

Judging by early images, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/robert-pattinson">Robert Pattinson</a>’s ride in the forthcoming reboot resembles none of these so much as a 1970s muscle car. This is bang on trend, because if you want to be taken seriously in the movies these days, a muscle car is what you need to be driving.</p><p>The definition is vague but the term broadly applies to a handful of souped-up US models of the late 60s and early 70s, whose mean lines and outsized horsepower made them the coolest cars on screen. None of your fancy European sports cars, thank you; these were more like crime cars, built for a fast getaway, an interstate smuggling run, or a leap across a rickety bridge that the pursuing cop cars just weren’t going to make. Muscle cars were lionised at the time in movies such as Vanishing Point, The Driver, Bullitt, Two-Lane Blacktop, Smokey and the Bandit, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/04/culture.peterbradshaw">Gone </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/aug/04/culture.peterbradshaw">in 60 Seconds</a> (in the 2000 remake the most sought-after car was basically the same model), not to mention the good ol’ Dukes of Hazzard, which eventually ran out of Dodge Chargers to trash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/wheels-within-reels-the-future-of-cars-on-the-screen-batman-to-vin-diesel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this weekly series, readers tell us about their favourite trees. This week: a Derbyshire oak that makes passersby smile</p><p>Darley Park lies just north of Derby city centre, sloping down to the River Derwent. Trees line the river, and are dotted around the park – beech, oak and chestnut predominate. It’s often busy with dog walkers, joggers and families, but it’s big enough to offer some peace and escape from the city.</p><p>I have been walking my dogs here for more than 20 years, and must have passed this particular oak hundreds of times without really noticing it. One day, I looked at it and saw this face looking back at me. Maybe the light was different on this day or I was more attuned to seeing it. Now I give it (him/her?) a nod when I pass, and I’ve seen others doing the same. There are plenty of more beautiful trees in the park, but I’m particularly fond of this one – it makes me smile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/16/i-looked-at-this-oak-one-day-and-saw-a-face-looking-back-at-me">Continue reading...</a>

## My wife and I still work – what mortgage should we get?

<p>I already receive two pensions and am due a third and we’re thinking of going for a lifetime mortgage</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I’m a 64-year-old man in full-time employment earning around £55,000 a year. My wife is 59 years old and a self-employed beauty therapist, earning around £7,000 a year. I already receive two pensions from previous employment which gives me about £7,500 a year before tax and, if I retire in July next year, I am due a further pre-tax pension of about £5,000 a year. I do, however, have the option to carry on working. We have a £190,000 deposit to buy a house but require another £90,000 to complete the purchase. Is it possible to get a lifetime mortgage to cover the extra we need, or is this type of mortgage just for existing homeowners? If it is, are there any alternative lending schemes on the market?<br /><strong>GR</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> Yes, it is possible to take out a lifetime mortgage – a form of equity release – to cover the extra £90,000 you need. And you don’t have to be an existing homeowner to be eligible for a lifetime mortgage (where the mortgage carries on until your death or the point at which you move into a care home). However, a lifetime mortgage may not be the best option. According to independent mortgage brokers, <a href="https://www.cliftonpf.co.uk/">Clifton Private Finance</a>, you’re a bit young to be considering a lifetime mortgage. And you could save money by opting for a retirement interest-only (RIO) mortgage instead. Designed “to keep repayment costs down for older borrowers on pension income”, says Clifton Private Finance, RIO mortgages mean that your monthly mortgage payments are repayments of interest only with no repayment of capital. If you went with “one building society which is offering a RIO mortgage at 2.79% interest per month, your monthly payments [on a £90,000 loan] would be an affordable £209 a month”. You would also have the option to repay up to 5% of the amount you borrowed each year should you find that you have cash to spare. Compared to equity release borrowing – in the form of a lifetime mortgage – the building society’s RIO mortgage deal “would be roughly half the cost”. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/16/my-wife-and-i-still-work-what-mortgage-should-we-get">Continue reading...</a>

The loss of locks started when I was about 21 and in my first job – with an unreasonable boss. Friends would casually joke about my receding hairline. Then I noticed the heavy fall of hair on my pillow in the mornings caused by – and causing even more – stress. I admitted to having a “widow’s peak”, that V-shaped point in the hairline. Then I brushed my hair forward, not to hide the bare skin, of course, but to copy the Beatles, who were then at <em>their</em> peak. OK, and to hide the bare skin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/16/thought-wig-tried-comb-over-now-im-bald-and-proud">Continue reading...</a>

Overnight, our leaders are imbued with qualities they previously did not possess; in Boris Johnson’s case, with qualities he is notorious for not possessing. His <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/boris-johnson-coronavirus-outbreak-how-strategy-shifted" title="">pandemic management plan</a>, one released with little supporting scientific evidence, is not to be questioned. It is to be followed and, if you like, praised. For those particularly susceptible to fetishising those in power in troubled times, it is to be hailed as not only clever, but a sort of counterintuitive genius. In Britain this is how we like our heroes – boffiny underdog types who retreat to their self-built labs at the bottom of the garden, and emerge with a panacea.</p><p>In these conditions, a leader is laundered of historical recklessness and proven incompetence. Any minor adjustments in behaviour become major corrections. There was a point towards the end of the government’s post-Cobra press conference when it became clear to me that Johnson was struggling to get through it all with a straight face, without making a quip. He ummed and aahed, fighting his compulsion by making vague noises. He almost pulled it off, but fell at the very last stretch, saying that the aim of the plan was to flatten the peak of the infection, to “squash that sombrero”. He then left with a hurried afterthought of a message to the stricken: “We will get through this.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/16/great-british-deference-dangerous-boris-johnson-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former vice-president and his more leftwing rival faced off in the first two-person Democratic debate<br /></p><p>Throughout this primary, I’ve heard supporters of other candidates complain about Bernie Sanders’ tendency to raise his voice. Where the hell was that yelling Bernie <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-debate-coronavirus-policies-latest">on Sunday night</a>? His tendency to try to keep an undignified process dignified and his discomfort with going for Joe Biden’s throat were on clear display. If Biden wins the nomination, he’s going to have to debate the least classy man ever to appear in World Wrestling Entertainment. Bernie would have been doing us – and frankly, Joe as well – a favor by channeling <a href="https://deadspin.com/stone-cold-steve-austin-gives-a-nsfw-defense-of-gay-m-1566573678">gay rights king</a> Stone Cold Steve Austin and pinning Biden on issues like how the 2008 bank bailout was disastrous for homeowners, or how his warmongering has stuck us in an endless war, or how the Violence Against Women Act that he loves to brag about <a href="https://theconversation.com/the-violence-against-women-act-is-unlikely-to-reduce-intimate-partner-violence-heres-why-103734">did basically nothing</a> to prevent violence in relationships.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/who-won-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-debate">Continue reading...</a>
