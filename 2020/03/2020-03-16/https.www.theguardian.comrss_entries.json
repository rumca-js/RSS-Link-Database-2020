Sadly, and predictably, there was a backlash against this casting choice. Many fans of the original Disney film could see no other mermaid than a pale-skinned one with red hair. Much ugliness ensued, especially online, from the hashtag #notmymermaid to petitions claiming that a black mermaid was \u201ca betrayal of Ariel\u2019s original creator\u201d.

We\u2019ve been dreaming up and writing about mermaids \u2013 pre-Christian water goddesses \u2013 for thousands of years, but it is notable that one of the first of these folkloric creatures to be written about was a black mermaid. Atargatis was an Assyrian goddess who had a human lover called Hadad, a shepherd, whom she killed by accident. The legends vary on how this happened, but the one I like most is that she overwhelmed him with her powerful lovemaking. They had a child together but so bereft was Atargatis at the death of her lover that she tried to drown herself in a lake.

My wife is 59 years old and a self-employed beauty therapist, earning around \u00a37,000 a year. I already receive two pensions from previous employment which gives me about \u00a37,500 a year before tax and, if I retire in July next year, I am due a further pre-tax pension of about \u00a35,000 a year. I do, however, have the option to carry on working. We have a \u00a3190,000 deposit to buy a house but require another \u00a390,000 to complete the purchase. Is it possible to get a lifetime mortgage to cover the extra we need, or is this type of mortgage just for existing homeowners? If it is, are there any alternative lending schemes on the market?<br /><strong>GR</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> Yes, it is possible to take out a lifetime mortgage \u2013 a form of equity release \u2013 to cover the extra \u00a390,000 you need. And you don\u2019t have to be an existing homeowner to be eligible for a lifetime mortgage (where the mortgage carries on until your death or the point at which you move into a care home). However, a lifetime mortgage may not be the best option. According to independent mortgage brokers, <a href=\"https://www.cliftonpf.co.uk/\">Clifton Private Finance</a>, you\u2019re a bit young to be considering a lifetime mortgage. And you could save money by opting for a retirement interest-only (RIO) mortgage instead. Designed \u201cto keep repayment costs down for older borrowers on pension income\u201d, says Clifton Private Finance, RIO mortgages mean that your monthly mortgage payments are repayments of interest only with no repayment of capital. If you went with \u201cone building society which is offering a RIO mortgage at 2.79% interest per month, your monthly payments [on a \u00a390,000 loan] would be an affordable \u00a3209 a month\u201d. You would also have the option to repay up to 5% of the amount you borrowed each year should you find that you have cash to spare. Compared to equity release borrowing \u2013 in the form of a lifetime mortgage \u2013 the building society\u2019s RIO mortgage deal \u201cwould be roughly half the cost\u201d. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/16/my-wife-and-i-still-work-what-mortgage-should-we-get\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/16/my-wife-and-i-still-work-what-mortgage-should-we-get", "date_published": "2020-03-16 07:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Qatar World Cup: report reveals 34 stadium worker deaths in six years", "description": "<p>Latest figures show nine stadium worker deaths in 2019 alone, as human rights organisations criticise delay in implementing labour reform</p><p>Nine migrant labourers working on the stadiums for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar died in 2019, the \u201csupreme committee\u201d organising the event has announced, bringing the number of deaths on World Cup projects to 34, since construction began six years ago.</p><p>31 of the deaths, including the nine who died last year, are classified as \u201cnon-work related\u201d, a term the supreme committee uses to describe deaths that largely occur off the worksite, most of which are attributed to sudden and unexplained cardiac or respiratory failure.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/16/qatar-world-cup-report-reveals-34-stadium-worker-deaths-in-six-years\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/16/qatar-world-cup-report-reveals-34-stadium-worker-deaths-in-six-years", "date_published": "2020-03-16 07:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "I thought about a wig and tried a comb-over.
