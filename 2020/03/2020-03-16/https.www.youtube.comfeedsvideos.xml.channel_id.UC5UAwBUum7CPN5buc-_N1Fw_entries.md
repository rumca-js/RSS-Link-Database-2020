The number of reported vulnerabilites in open source projects has surged 50% in 2019, with over 6000 vulnerabilities disclosed. The good news is, these are very often reported with a patch to fix them, in 85% of cases, and this means that open source projects are still being watched for security and fixed rapidly. Still, it also means that open source teams have to spend more of their time on these issues than on improving the projects in other ways, and since open source developers don’t always have enough time already, it could put a strain on the advancement of various FOSS projects.
