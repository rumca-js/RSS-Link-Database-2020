• McIlroy shoots first-round 66, one behind American Matt Every<br />• ‘My caddy called my bunker shot my best of the season’<p>In seeking to avoid a “fried” brain, Rory McIlroy is not thinking about the Masters. His form will leave others to speculate about the world No 1’s prospects at the first major of the year, which is only a month away.</p><p>A first round 66 at the Arnold Palmer Invitational planted McIlroy at the summit of the leaderboard before Matt Every’s late surge saw him take a one-stroke advantage. Day one saw the kind of effortless, free-flowing golf which renders the Northern Irishman so appealing. The score was even more impressive given he was one over par after six holes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/05/rory-mcilroy-shot-of-the-year-arnold-palmer-invitational">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Leeds Playhouse </strong><br />The Victorian orphan is given an even greater sense of exclusion in Amy Leach’s excellent production for Ramps on the Moon</p><p>Brooklyn Melvin’s Oliver has a ferocious roar but no voice. Moon-faced and wide-eyed, she plays the Dickens hero as a lip-reading innocent. If Oliver lacks agency in the novel, he is even more adrift here where, without even BSL in his armoury, he has few means to express himself. But who needs speech when Melvin is so mesmerising?</p><p>At large in a Victorian London made cruel by poverty, Oliver is at the heart of a politically astute adaptation. If you thought the crime, penury and violence of the novel were bad, imagine how much worse things would be if you were deaf at that time. In a production excellently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/26/oliver-twist-leeds-playhouse-accessible-deaf-disabled-actors">directed by Amy Leach for Ramps on the Moon</a>, a conglomerate of theatres committed to “normalising the presence of deaf and disabled people across the theatre industry”, the colourful cast of characters are excluded twice over: once by poverty, once by disability.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/05/oliver-twist-review-artful-new-take-on-dickens-is-stunning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The collapse of Flybe is a timely pre-budget reminder. Regional equality is costly, complex and long term</p><p>The collapse of the regional airline <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/flybe-business-and-political-leaders-warn-of-severe-impact-on-regional-economies" title="">Flybe</a> carries a serious and timely warning for Boris Johnson’s government. Having campaigned in December’s general election on a promise to “level up” the disparate and unequal regional economies of the UK – and having won a spectacular election victory in some of the more deprived English regions – ministers had been keen to show that they meant it. When the Exeter-based airline threatened to collapse in January, the government duly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/flybe-saved-after-successful-last-ditch-talks" title="">stepped in</a> to attempt a rescue package to keep it in the air. Now, less than two months later, Flybe has gone into administration anyway. The coronavirus outbreak’s impact on airline bookings was the last straw. The effect on regional connectivity in these islands is likely to be grim. Around 2,000 people have lost their jobs, with others likely to follow in the supply chain.</p><p>The wider lesson of Flybe is that ministers can do the right thing, as they did here, but without achieving the sustained effect that they had hoped for. This lesson matters a lot, because the problem of regional inequality is very extensive and extremely complex. It also matters because the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to set out a more strategic approach to the problem and to make it a centrepiece of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/levelling-up-britain-why-cornwall-needs-more-than-just-tourism" title="">next week’s budget</a>. It is important for the regions and the country, never mind the government, that he gets it right. Flybe is a reminder in two ways that this is not easy: first because big sums of money are often involved over a long period in effective government interventions, and second because the economic impact of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-could-push-uk-to-brink-of-recession-says-goldman-sachs" title="">coronavirus</a> may also be fierce in unforeseen ways.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-easy-to-say-hard-to-do">Continue reading...</a>

The public’s appetite for a less vicious politics is clear. The leaders of political movements must rise to the occasion<p>Anger is exhausting. There is only so long most people can sustain a state of permanent fury, let alone put up with it in others. It takes a lot of energy to remain at boiling point, ever vigilant to the next perceived outrage, and eventually most people burn out. It was this kind of longing for the shouting to stop, almost as much as Brexit fever, that Boris Johnson arguably tapped into with his wildly misleading promise to just get the whole leaving business over and done with. Paradoxically, it’s this same bone-weariness that may also eventually lead a polarised country towards some kind of healing.</p><p>This hardly feels like an auspicious week to launch a campaign for a kinder, more generous and socially cohesive politics, what with the home secretary being embroiled in allegations of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/03/dominic-cummings-fostering-culture-of-bullying-says-labour" title="">repeatedly bullying</a> civil servants. But perhaps the timing of the new all-party parliamentary group <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51725597" title="">Compassion in Politics</a>, launched by the former Tory cabinet minister Lady Warsi and former Labour frontbencher Debbie Abrahams, is smarter than it looks.

We never stop to think about what we would do if Peter Andre was forced into a period of self-isolation. Our world would surely change beyond recognition, no? Who would soothe the Loose Women with a biweekly pop-in? Who would walk through the corridors of exotic hotels making explanatory hand gestures on This Morning? Who would – what else does Peter Andre do? He, uh … Hmm. The shadow Andre casts is huge compared with the actual career that preceded it. If you really think about it, he did one song and married Jordan for a bit, 15 years ago. But Andre has a unique place in British culture and British hearts, and for that reason, were he absent from celebrity life for any time due to coronavirus, our economy would soon sink like a ship.</p><p>I should clarify, before the lawyers get involved, that Andre does not have coronavirus. But this week he acted as a sort of canary-in-the-coalmine for what would happen if one of our daytime TV stars did get it, and what would happen, broadly, is “mild to medium panic”.

<p>On the coronavirus threat, England’s chief medical officer is honest – an attitude unlikely to catch on in government</p><p>What a difference a week makes. For several years now, we’ve got used to being told that experts are a waste of space. Doomsters and gloomsters who trade in telling you things you don’t want to hear. What was needed was a good honest dose of mindless optimism to talk the country up. Want to believe that Brexit will be a brilliant success and there’s an oven-ready deal to take us to the promised land? Then the Tories had just the government for you.</p><p>But now we’re heading for several months of a coronavirus pandemic, the UK wants rather more than a prime minister who lies about building 40 new hospitals and a 12-year-old Tigger of a health secretary whose main contribution has been to replace his Blue Peter sticker with a NHS badge. Even Boris Johnson, the narcissist’s narcissist who can’t imagine a world without him at its centre, has had to bow to the inevitable and take advice from people who know what they are talking about. For a while at least, the geeks have inherited the Earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/05/as-chris-whitty-provides-a-dose-of-reality-boris-is-just-an-annoying-distraction">Continue reading...</a>

## Strangulation, asphyxiation, rubber: making the BDSM romcom Dogs Don't Wear Pants

<p>Finnish director Jukka-Pekka Valkeapää ensured that his new film was torture for his actors – literally. But he insists his immersive methods are just like gardening</p><p>BDSM is – perhaps surprisingly – big news in Palm Springs, southern California. The director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1672969/" title="">Jukka-Pekka Valkeapää</a>, showing his new, fetish-themed, third feature, Dogs Don’t Wear Pants, at a festival in the city, was confronted with a crowd of incredulous pensioners. “There was a question: is this BDSM thing real? Is it invented?” he says, chuckling. One shocked septuagenarian collared him after the screening to inquire after the mental health of the film’s hero: a widower who, after losing his wife in a drowning accident, tumbles headlong into the S&amp;M scene. “She was saying: ‘No, he’s gone crazy. He’s totally lost it,’” says Valkeapää, hooting with laughter. He simmers down. “It’s not a very noble thing to achieve, disturbing old ladies.”</p><p>Dogs Don’t Wear Pants is indeed disconcerting, but in the best possible way. Rather than being a 50 Shades-style glossy brochure-tour of BDSM, it uses the scene to get intimate with the film’s lead couple – and explore the meaning, and the price, of true emotional honesty. The grieving Juha (Pekka Strang) is on autopilot until he takes his teenage daughter to a tattoo parlour and stumbles into the dungeon next door. There he meets Mona (Krista Kosonen), whose asphyxiation sessions give him a gateway to the final moments with his wife. Morbid on paper, Valkeapää’s kooky, tender film holds you under, then leaves you gasping with renewed lust for life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/05/how-romcoms-inspired-finnish-bdsm-film-dogs-dont-wear-pants">Continue reading...</a>

The current favourite is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding">MPEG-4/H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding)</a>, which is usually called MP4 for short.

<p>‘We were in the Alps, on one of the most spectacular train journeys you can make. I love how the yawning man contrasts with the majesty of the mountains outside’ </p><p>I’m very attached to this photograph. It was taken during the first real holiday I had with my father. Of course I’d travelled with him and my mother when I was a child, but I had to wait until I was 39 to have the experience of travelling just with him. There was no specific reason why in September 2015 we decided to take a trip of a few days into Switzerland, but I’m so glad we did. It was a magical experience and helped us better know and understand each other. And it was on that trip that I took this image that proved a turning point in my photographic career.</p><p>We were on the <a href="https://www.rhb.ch/en/panoramic-trains/bernina-express">Bernina Express</a>, which leaves Tirano in the north of Italy every day and travels across the Alps into Switzerland. The distinctive red train takes a historic Unesco world heritage route on the Alps’ highest railway and is one of the steepest railway climbs in the world. It’s surely one of the most beautiful and spectacular train journeys you’ll ever make.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/05/train-across-alps-bernina-express-giancarlo-staubmann-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

Chefs from Spain to Estonia tell us their best-kept food secrets</p><p>After all these years of Swedes working in French kitchens and Italian chefs moving to Denmark, you could be forgiven for thinking of European cuisine as one big homogenous offering, a pot not so much melting as melted into one big lump of Eurofood. But all it takes is a walk through a market in some new place for the untapped riches of the continental table to hit you.

## The invisible city: how a homeless man built a life underground

<p>After decades among the hidden homeless, Dominic Van Allen dug himself a bunker beneath a public park. But his life would get even more precarious. By Tom Lamont</p><p>Most nights, before bed, before it all went wrong, Dominic Van Allen whiled away the last of the evening hours in a pub called The Garden Gate. It was easy to fit in and feel smart there, chatting and drinking with a crowd who passed through in varied states of dishevelment. Dog-walkers brought in sodden dogs. Exhausted junior doctors shambled in after shifts with their sleeves pushed up. There were scarved and suited older men, frail as antique hatstands, and casually dressed professionals with jobs in finance or entertainment who owned expensive homes nearby. “And it’s you rich buggers,” Van Allen marvelled, genially enough, as he eyed the state of their trainers, “who can afford to look the scruffiest.” He wore durable boots, khaki trousers and a leather motorcycle jacket, and could have been mistaken for a bike courier, a builder, maybe a maintenance guy at the hospital next door, where he was known in the staff canteen as someone who would wander in at dawn to buy a discount coffee.</p><p>That winter of 2017, Van Allen was 44 years old – tall, with close-cropped blond hair, blue eyes and a faint Yorkshire accent. At the pub, his was an ale. As soon as he judged it was late enough, Van Allen drank up and said his goodnights, bearing north from the pub and walking up a tree-lined road that hugged one side of Hampstead Heath. A vast open space that sits as a sort of green beehive haircut on top of metropolitan central London, the heath is untamed in parts and otherwise mown and managed like any public park. Every day, people visit by the thousand: runners, outdoor swimmers, tourists, bird-lovers on the trail of whitethroats and blackcaps in the bushes or goldfinches and kestrels in the trees. Sometimes a travelling circus unfolds itself on the hard-packed sand of the heath’s carpark. Summer brings sunbathers, picnickers and sixth-formers sat in circles, while in winter, on those rare occasions it snows, people drag in toboggans. On this night, in December 2017, forecasters had predicted flurries overnight. Van Allen moved briskly, eager to get in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/05/invisible-city-how-homeless-man-built-life-underground-bunker-hampstead-heath">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, has staked out his vision for the future of Europe, but with Germany reluctant to sign up, will it fall flat? Plus: Jonathan Freedland on Joe Biden’s spectacular comeback in the Democratic primaries on Super Tuesday </p><p>France and Germany have been central to the European Union project ever since it began out of the ashes of the second world war. Despite centuries of enmity, the two countries have driven the major changes in European cooperation for more than 50 years. But as Germany’s economy has pulled far ahead of that of its neighbour, its appetite for fundamental reform in Europe appears to have waned. </p><p>This is the challenge for France’s energetic young president, Emmanuel Macron, who sees European values under threat from authoritarian governments springing up across the globe. But can he convince Germany – and whoever eventually succeeds Angela Merkel – that his vision of closer union, further economic integration and ambitions for expansion is the right one for Europe?
