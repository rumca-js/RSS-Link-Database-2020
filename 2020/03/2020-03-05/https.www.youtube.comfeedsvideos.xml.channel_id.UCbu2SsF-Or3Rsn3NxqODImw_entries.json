That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding, making it a worthwhile pursuit, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.\n\nFor the final episode of our guide to Competitive Pokemon, Kallie dives into Pokemon breeding and EV training. This video will teach you how to efficiently breed the perfect Pokemon, teach it the right moves, and EV train it. \n\nIn GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, \"In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place. You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch.\"\n\n#PokemonSwordandShield #CompetitivePokemon #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWln3GNhsfQ", "date_published": "2020-03-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ghost Of Tsushima Release Date & Story: Everything You Need To Know In Under 4 Minutes", "description": "The Ghost of Tsushima release date is June 26. Here's everything we know so far about Sucker Punch's next PS4 exclusive.\n\nSucker Punch has announced the Ghost of Tsushima release date, alongside a new story trailer. The samurai game is set on the real-world Tsushima Island, which was invaded by the Mongol Empire in 1274. Samurai Jin Sakai leads a rebellion against the occupying Mongol horde after its successful invasion of the island.\n\nGhost of Tsushima isn't entirely violent though. Sucker Punch studio head Chris Zimmerman explained to us that Tsushima's natural beauty will be a big part of the game. Of course, as you ride your horse over rolling hills and dense forests, you will have to stop to duel Mongol soldiers.\n\nIn addition to the launch date and story trailer, Sucker Punch announced several editions of the game, detailed in our pre-order guide. These include a variety of digital and physical bonuses.\n\n#GhostOfTsushima #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSjDmCtRRs0", "date_published": "2020-03-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Playing Halo: Combat Evolved On PC With You | GameSpot Community Fridays", "description": "Halo: Combat Evolved got a surprise release on PC this week so we're gonna play some multiplayer with you guys!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do2Dydky8Q8", "date_published": "2020-03-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Playing The Witcher 3 In 2020 And Animal Crossing PAX Demo | GameSpot After Dark #31", "description": "On this week's episode of GameSpot After Dark, Kallie is joined by Michael Higham, Kurt Indovina, and Ashley Oh to talk about The Witcher 3, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and Murder By Numbers!

In this video we craft, re-arrange our furniture, try some new clothes, snitch on some residents, and explore the Museum.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons is almost here, but we got a closer look at it during PAX East 2020. The series' debut on the Nintendo Switch includes a bunch of new features and changes that make this relaxing life-sim all the more exciting. There's a new town hall, a revamped Able Sisters clothing store, an extravagant upgrade to the museum, the new crafting bench, and tweaked home design mechanics. We explore and dig into all this in the video above.\n\nNew Horizons will introduce a significant crafting mechanic, where you'll gather different resources to build items like furniture and tools. You'll be able to customize your house similarly to Happy Home Designer, which makes decorating a bit easier. At the town hall, you can talk to Isabelle where to change the island's song or flag, and report things that you don't want in the game (such as inappropriate clothing designs that villagers might adopt from other islands). We also got a look at the myriad of cosmetics that'll be available; shirts, bottoms, hats, glasses, socks, shoes, and accessories are all customizable. Lastly, the museum has been renovated with an aquarium for fish, an exhibit for fossils, and a biodome for bugs--and it's lovely.\n\nThe game launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020, and for more on this adorable adventure, be sure to watch our video on 19 new things in Animal Crossing: New Horizons or read our preview from our previous hands-on demo. You can also read up on how New Horizons is handling save data recovery or how it's adopting a common shooter feature to make gameplay easier.\n\n#AnimalCrossingNewHorizons #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBqbv7Nx2JI", "date_published": "2020-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ghost Of Tsushima - Official Story And Release Date Trailer", "description": "Ghost of Tsushima is arriving on PlayStation 4 June 26, 2020.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24jDIftu97s", "date_published": "2020-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Let's Play Half-Life Remake Black Mesa, Out Of Steam Early Access Today", "description": "After 17 years the Half-Life remake fan project turned commercial release, Black Mesa, is now officially out of early access with its 1.0 release.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmpTd_zfbkM", "date_published": "2020-03-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "What You Should Know About Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare\u2019s Tomogunchi", "description": "Tomogunchi are Call of Duty's bloodthirsty Tamagotchi pets.
