The Score Stronger tekst

I don't do this for the riches
I'm infected, my condition is I'm always in my head
These words are my religion,
I'm obsessed it's by decision
I'ma do this til I'm dead

Set me on fire, set me on, set me on fire
Whoa whoa
I'm still alive, I'm still a, I'm still alive
Whoa, whoa-bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

Higher, faster, ever lasting
Harder, faster, ever never crashing

Stronger, bet you didn't think that I'd come back to life

I do this with conviction
I write truths and never fiction
My disease is what you fed
I can't stop with my ambition
Like a missile on a mission
I'm a force that you will dread

Stronger, stronger, ever lasting
Higher, faster, never crashing

The Score ft. XYLØ Bulletproof tekst

I wish—I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
I wish—I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
(Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof)
I'm trippin' on my words and my patience
Writing every verse in a cadence
To tell you how I feel, how I feel, how I feel (Yeah)
This is how I deal, how I deal, how I deal (Yeah)
With who I once was, now an acquaintance
Think my confidence (My confidence) is in the basement
Tryin' to keep it real, keep it real, keep it real (Yeah)
'Cause I'm not made of steel, made of steel
Yeah, I'm fighting a battle within
And I don't know where to begin, oh-oh
A monster inside of my skin
And I don't know where to begin, oh-oh
I wish—I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
I wish that I could wear a mask and face the truth
I wish that I was—
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
Watch all my doubts, they ricochet, nothing to lose
I wish that I was—
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
I don't have super strength, can't run through fire
Some days I feel afraid of all the feelings in my mind
I'm tryin' to keep it real, keep it real, keep it real (Yeah)
'Cause I'm not made of steel, made of steel
Now I'm fighting a battle within
And I don't know where to begin, oh-oh
A monster inside of my skin
And I don't know where to begin, oh-oh
I wish—I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
I wish that I could wear a mask and face the truth
I wish that I was—
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
Watch all my doubts, they ricochet, nothing to lose
I wish that I was—
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
A monster inside of my skin
And I don't know where to begin, oh-oh
There's a monster inside of my skin
And I don't know who's gonna win, oh-oh
I wish—I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
I wish that I could wear a mask and face the truth
I wish that I was—
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
I wish that I was bulletproof, bulletproof
Watch all my doubts, they ricochet, nothing to lose
I wish that I was—
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
I wish—I wish that I was...
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
I wish—I wish that I was...
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
Bullet-bulletproof, bullet-bullet-bulletproof
I wish—I wish that I was...
