For the final episode of our competitive Pokemon Sword and Shield mini-series, Kallie dives into Pokemon breeding and EV training.

Even if you've played every Pokemon game, there's a good chance you've never played it competitively. That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding, making it a worthwhile pursuit, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.

For the final episode of our guide to Competitive Pokemon, Kallie dives into Pokemon breeding and EV training. This video will teach you how to efficiently breed the perfect Pokemon, teach it the right moves, and EV train it. 

In GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, "In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place. You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch."

The Ghost of Tsushima release date is June 26. Here's everything we know so far about Sucker Punch's next PS4 exclusive.

Sucker Punch has announced the Ghost of Tsushima release date, alongside a new story trailer. The samurai game is set on the real-world Tsushima Island, which was invaded by the Mongol Empire in 1274. Samurai Jin Sakai leads a rebellion against the occupying Mongol horde after its successful invasion of the island.

Ghost of Tsushima isn't entirely violent though. Sucker Punch studio head Chris Zimmerman explained to us that Tsushima's natural beauty will be a big part of the game. Of course, as you ride your horse over rolling hills and dense forests, you will have to stop to duel Mongol soldiers.

In addition to the launch date and story trailer, Sucker Punch announced several editions of the game, detailed in our pre-order guide. These include a variety of digital and physical bonuses.

We got the chance to go hands-on with Animal Crossing: New Horizons at PAX East 2020. In this video we craft, re-arrange our furniture, try some new clothes, snitch on some residents, and explore the Museum.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is almost here, but we got a closer look at it during PAX East 2020. The series' debut on the Nintendo Switch includes a bunch of new features and changes that make this relaxing life-sim all the more exciting. There's a new town hall, a revamped Able Sisters clothing store, an extravagant upgrade to the museum, the new crafting bench, and tweaked home design mechanics. We explore and dig into all this in the video above.

New Horizons will introduce a significant crafting mechanic, where you'll gather different resources to build items like furniture and tools. You'll be able to customize your house similarly to Happy Home Designer, which makes decorating a bit easier. At the town hall, you can talk to Isabelle where to change the island's song or flag, and report things that you don't want in the game (such as inappropriate clothing designs that villagers might adopt from other islands). We also got a look at the myriad of cosmetics that'll be available; shirts, bottoms, hats, glasses, socks, shoes, and accessories are all customizable. Lastly, the museum has been renovated with an aquarium for fish, an exhibit for fossils, and a biodome for bugs--and it's lovely.

The game launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020, and for more on this adorable adventure, be sure to watch our video on 19 new things in Animal Crossing: New Horizons or read our preview from our previous hands-on demo. You can also read up on how New Horizons is handling save data recovery or how it's adopting a common shooter feature to make gameplay easier.

Tomogunchi are Call of Duty's bloodthirsty Tamagotchi pets. Here's how you get them, how to understand their emotional states, how to see them in-game, how to keep them happy, and how to hatch more. Modern Warfare is out on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

In a surprising and unexpected development, Infinity Ward added Tamagotchi-style virtual pets to Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Yes, really. In Modern Warfare, they're called Tomogunchi pets, and you can equip them to your watch to see their cute smiling faces while you murder enemies.

But how does it all work? GameSpot's Aaron Sampson breaks it all down in a video video. Check out the video above to find out how to buy one of the Tomogunchi pets and what you need to do to keep the little creature happy. In short, you're encouraged to keep playing … and playing well. If you keep losing, your pet can die, so stay frosty out there, soldiers. 

Be sure to watch the full video above to find out everything you need to know about Tomogunchi pets. The Tomogunchi pets arrive in Modern Warfare ahead of the rumored battle royale mode, Warzone, which is reportedly set to launch later this month. Keep checking back with GameSpot for lots more on Modern Warfare in the time ahead.
