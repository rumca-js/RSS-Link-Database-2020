Having campaigned in December\u2019s general election on a promise to \u201clevel up\u201d the disparate and unequal regional economies of the UK \u2013 and having won a spectacular election victory in some of the more deprived English regions \u2013 ministers had been keen to show that they meant it. When the Exeter-based airline threatened to collapse in January, the government duly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/flybe-saved-after-successful-last-ditch-talks\" title=\"\">stepped in</a> to attempt a rescue package to keep it in the air. Now, less than two months later, Flybe has gone into administration anyway. The coronavirus outbreak\u2019s impact on airline bookings was the last straw. The effect on regional connectivity in these islands is likely to be grim. Around 2,000 people have lost their jobs, with others likely to follow in the supply chain.</p><p>The wider lesson of Flybe is that ministers can do the right thing, as they did here, but without achieving the sustained effect that they had hoped for. This lesson matters a lot, because the problem of regional inequality is very extensive and extremely complex. It also matters because the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to set out a more strategic approach to the problem and to make it a centrepiece of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/04/levelling-up-britain-why-cornwall-needs-more-than-just-tourism\" title=\"\">next week\u2019s budget</a>. It is important for the regions and the country, never mind the government, that he gets it right. Flybe is a reminder in two ways that this is not easy: first because big sums of money are often involved over a long period in effective government interventions, and second because the economic impact of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-could-push-uk-to-brink-of-recession-says-goldman-sachs\" title=\"\">coronavirus</a> may also be fierce in unforeseen ways.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-easy-to-say-hard-to-do\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/05/the-guardian-view-on-levelling-up-easy-to-say-hard-to-do", "date_published": "2020-03-05 18:28:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Devs review \u2013 Alex Garland's elegant but flawed big tech thriller", "description": "<p>The writer-director of Ex Machina and Annihilation heads to the small screen for an imaginative series that suffers from a listless lead performance</p><p>If there was one complaint about Alex Garland\u2019s intoxicating sci-fi thriller <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/22/annihilation-review-natalie-portman-thriller-leaves-a-haunting-impression\">Annihilation</a>, it would be one of length.

But his life would get even more precarious. By Tom Lamont</p><p>Most nights, before bed, before it all went wrong, Dominic Van Allen whiled away the last of the evening hours in a pub called The Garden Gate. It was easy to fit in and feel smart there, chatting and drinking with a crowd who passed through in varied states of dishevelment. Dog-walkers brought in sodden dogs. Exhausted junior doctors shambled in after shifts with their sleeves pushed up. There were scarved and suited older men, frail as antique hatstands, and casually dressed professionals with jobs in finance or entertainment who owned expensive homes nearby. \u201cAnd it\u2019s you rich buggers,\u201d Van Allen marvelled, genially enough, as he eyed the state of their trainers, \u201cwho can afford to look the scruffiest.\u201d He wore durable boots, khaki trousers and a leather motorcycle jacket, and could have been mistaken for a bike courier, a builder, maybe a maintenance guy at the hospital next door, where he was known in the staff canteen as someone who would wander in at dawn to buy a discount coffee.</p><p>That winter of 2017, Van Allen was 44 years old \u2013 tall, with close-cropped blond hair, blue eyes and a faint Yorkshire accent. At the pub, his was an ale. As soon as he judged it was late enough, Van Allen drank up and said his goodnights, bearing north from the pub and walking up a tree-lined road that hugged one side of Hampstead Heath. A vast open space that sits as a sort of green beehive haircut on top of metropolitan central London, the heath is untamed in parts and otherwise mown and managed like any public park. Every day, people visit by the thousand: runners, outdoor swimmers, tourists, bird-lovers on the trail of whitethroats and blackcaps in the bushes or goldfinches and kestrels in the trees. Sometimes a travelling circus unfolds itself on the hard-packed sand of the heath\u2019s carpark. Summer brings sunbathers, picnickers and sixth-formers sat in circles, while in winter, on those rare occasions it snows, people drag in toboggans. On this night, in December 2017, forecasters had predicted flurries overnight. Van Allen moved briskly, eager to get in.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/05/invisible-city-how-homeless-man-built-life-underground-bunker-hampstead-heath\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/mar/05/invisible-city-how-homeless-man-built-life-underground-bunker-hampstead-heath", "date_published": "2020-03-05 06:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus latest updates: Australia modelling plans from 'benign' to 'worst-case' scenario with millions infected", "description": "<p>Germany labels outbreak a pandemic as cases spread across Europe as UK sees highest daily increase.
