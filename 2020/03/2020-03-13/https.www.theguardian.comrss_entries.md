Itoje has been offered a seven-figure sum to join the top French side Racing 92 on loan rather than turn out for relegated Saracens in the Championship but the idea has been vetoed by other Premiership club owners.</p><p>The England head coach, Eddie Jones, and other senior Twickenham officials had hoped Itoje’s proposed switch would be approved and help ensure one of England’s key players would be suitably primed for international duty. The clubs, however, have blocked the loan proposal, insisting it does not fit the “exceptional circumstances” clause which might theoretically allow a player to represent his country while based abroad.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/premiership-clubs-block-maro-itojes-racing-92-loan-to-spark-row-with-rfu">Continue reading...</a>

From ye olde panicke buying to quack cures, conspiracy theories and imbeciles with public platforms, the plague had it all<p>Having had a temperature and a dry cough for some days now – don’t worry, I’m not going to write That Column – I’ve been doing the reading equivalent of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/31/10-10-fashion-shop-closet" title="">shopping in my closet</a>. And, ever a sucker for a theme, this has turned out to be that rare occasion where I’ve ended up going: “Ooh, I must have some more Fruit &amp; Nut and get Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year down off the shelves”. Forgive me; that was unclear. Fruit &amp; Nut is a hugely frequent occurrence; a need for historical accounts of mass distemper less so.</p><p>Obviously I’m slightly put out to discover that what follows might not be the first review of the work. I understand Defoe’s fascinating account of the 1665-66 London plague season received very favourable notices when it came out (the year 1722). I myself found it a brilliant curiosity of a book when I read it first time round (the year 1995). But from the particular vantage point of the year 2020, I can only say: guys, it really is all there. Ye olde panicke buying, ye olde refusal to self-isolate – “they did not take the least care or make any scruple of infecting others” – ye olde wittering and twittering of conspiracy theories. “The error of the times,” as Defoe optimistically judges them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/plague-coronavirus-british-panic-buying">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For some OCD patients, not washing their hands is part of their treatment. So guidance to do so regularly is reviving their anxieties – and triggering them in others</p><p>Boris Johnson does it while singing Happy Birthday twice. For Jacob Rees-Mogg, it’s the national anthem. And as soap supplies run low, it seems much of Britain is following their example and heeding the official guidance <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hand-sanitiser-or-hand-washing-which-more-effective-against-coronavirus-covid-19">to wash hands thoroughly and often</a>, in order to minimise the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>It is good public health advice, of course. Indeed, one question raised by the rush for soap is just what all those people without any in the house did before. But for some people with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), to be warned they must scrub to protect themselves from an invisible enemy, and to do so in a ritualistic way with internal musical accompaniment, is akin to inviting a demon to come for tea. Some of these people have spent years trying <em>not</em> to wash their hands, often as a prescribed part of their treatment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/13/why-regular-handwashing-can-be-bad-advice-for-patients">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff on memories of kissing the love of her life on a platform, travelling in darkness towards the open arms of family and the meaning of ‘trainbragging’<br /></p><p>I made my first home on a train. Underneath a large, empty luggage rack, at six years old. I curled myself away, hung up my coat to cover the space, so no one could see inside but me, and set out my belongings neatly. There was a pile of books – a library. An orange and some biscuits – the kitchen. And my backpack, a pillow, and, therefore, a bed. As we rumbled towards London St Pancras, my parents duly started pacing the carriageways to find me and I emerged, sad but sated, ready for the big city.</p><p>We all know there’s something special about train journeys, and for me, they will always be tied to my youthful imagination of personal time and space. It’s the British in us, but on a seated train, where there’s no expectation to talk to anyone, you can find peace and solitude in the untouchable space of your seat. You can strategise, evilly, and cover your coveted second seat with a bag to luxuriate in double the space. Pretend like you’re on the Hogwarts Express and grab a cheeky rocky road and piping coffee from the trolley lady. But nowadays, as the Nakates, Hirsis and Thunbergs of the world take up the mantle of progress, there’s an added benefit: environmental footprint.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-magic-of-train-travel/2020/mar/13/peace-solitude-and-environmental-smugness-a-love-letter-to-train-travel">Continue reading...</a>

Things were OK. Then my landlord passed away and relative took over and I had to move out. It was my plan to try to find somewhere else to live, but my wages weren’t enough to save for a deposit. I approached the council, who said they couldn’t help find me a flat because I didn’t have dependants. But I’m a carrier of sickle cell disease, so it means that my environment had to be safe and clean. I couldn’t just move into a shared house because I would have very little control over someone else’s hygiene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2020/mar/13/life-after-homelessness-when-they-found-me-a-flat-i-felt-nothing-could-stop-me">Continue reading...</a>

The Rearranged Life of Oona Lockhart by Margarita Montimore; The Lost Future of Pepperharrow by Natasha Pulley; By Force Alone by Lavie Tidhar; Providence by Max Barry; and House of Earth and Blood by Sarah J Maas<p>It’s New Year’s Eve 1982 and Oona Lockhart, who turns 19 tomorrow, faces a dilemma: to remain in New York with her musician boyfriend, or to leave him for university in London. A day later, the choice has been made for her. Oona is no longer 18, and it’s no longer the 1980s. She awakes in the body of her 51-year-old self, and the year is 2015. So begins Margarita Montimore’s thought-provoking <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-rearranged-life-of-oona-lockhart-9781473227606.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" title="">The Rearranged Life of Oona Lockhart</a></strong> (Gollancz, £14.99). The novel follows Oona over the course of eight disordered years as, on each New Year’s Day, she finds herself inhabiting her own body at a different age: one year she is 51, the next 27, then 40 … It’s a non-sequential journey of self-discovery in which she must come to terms, both psychologically and practically, with her unique predicament. Knowledge of the future allows her to amass material wealth, but does awareness of her mistakes allow her to avoid making them once again? By turns tragic and triumphant, heartbreakingly poignant and joyful, this is ultimately an uplifting and redemptive read.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/13/science-fiction-fantasy-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

Think about who taught you to brush your teeth. I’m 45, so for me it was a generation born in the 1940s, who have had oral health issues … and then the people who taught them often ended up with no teeth.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/healthy-smiles/2020/mar/13/clean-your-teeth-before-breakfast-the-ultimate-guide-to-brushing-your-teeth">Continue reading...</a>

## Coronavirus misinformation is dangerous. Think before you share | Tom Phillips

<p>Trustworthy health advice has never been more vital – it could be the difference between life and death<br /><br />• Tom Phillips is the editor of Full Fact</p><p>Last year we had a call from a concerned but grateful parent. Having previously been sceptical about vaccines, having read one of our <a href="https://fullfact.org/search/?q=vaccine#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=vaccines&amp;gsc.sort=" title="">fact checks</a>, she’d decided to go ahead and have her children vaccinated. It sticks in my mind as an example of the harm that bad information can do – not just to our democracy, which as fact checkers we’re often asked about – but to our health.</p><p>Misleading claims around vaccines have encouraged parents to disregard medical advice and take unnecessary risks with their children’s lives. Since the outbreak of the new coronavirus began, we have been fighting a similar tide of false claims and exaggerations. Much of this has originated and spread on social media. As is common during global news events – especially health crises – some have sought to pin the blame on familiar enemies, whether it is <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/wuhan-5g-coronavirus/" title="">5G technology</a>, the <a href="https://fullfact.org/online/Rothschild-coronavirus/" title="">Rothschilds</a> or <a href="https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-government-laboratory/" title="">Chinese lab scientists</a>. Many people have spread conspiracy theories, playing on our fears by suggesting that somehow the institutions that are supposed to protect us somehow had forewarning of – or even planned – the global outbreak of this deadly virus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-misinformation-health-advice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We pulled up to a bonfire and 15 kids gathered around me. It was horrifying</p><p>One night when I was 15, I was woken by two large men I didn’t know. It was May 1989 and I was at home in Connecticut. I sensed we were alone in the house; our dog didn’t run in and, although my bedroom was between my sister’s and my parents’, everything was quiet. I was terrified but half-asleep. The men told me to get dressed and said I was going with them. I thought I was being abducted but they handed me a note in my dad’s handwriting. It said: “We love you. This is for the best.”</p><p>I was not a bad kid; I had a boyfriend and smoked some pot. But I did have a tumultuous relationship with my parents. I followed the men’s instructions, then tried to run when we got out of the house, but they handcuffed me. We headed to the airport and on to a private jet. Strangely, I bonded with the men. On the flight, they fed me and said I was going to want to eat, which confused me. We landed in Utah and they handed me over to two other people. That’s when I cried. I was driven to a trailer in the desert, strip-searched and given a military poncho, blankets and food rations, including a can of chicken soup. Then I was driven farther into the desert in darkness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/13/experience-i-was-kidnapped-and-taken-to-the-desert">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He is often at our house and we usually have a few beers together</p><p>My wife and I emigrated several years ago when she was headhunted for a top job. We met at university and had a similar status in the UK, but the move made her much more professionally successful than me. We have a fantastic life here, and have had two children since moving. However, the small community, and the repetitiveness of expat life, can make things dull. Last year, my wife started an affair with our gardener, partly to relieve her boredom.</p><p>At first I was oblivious to their relationship, and when I eventually found out I surprised myself by not being angry. I could tell she was more fulfilled emotionally and physically, and I was happy about that. What makes it easier is that I really like my wife’s lover.

Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans – current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus’s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19">including the UK</a>, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-facts-is-there-a-cure-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate-of-the-virus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Trump used to flirt with anti-vaxxers. Now he is demanding a coronavirus vaccine<br /></p><p>“Do me a favor, speed it up, speed it up.” This is what Donald Trump told the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference, recounting what he said to pharmaceutical executives about the progress toward a vaccine for severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (Sars-CoV-2), the virus that causes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-facts-cure-mortality-rate-virus-covid-19-flu">coronavirus disease 2019</a> (Covid-19). Anthony Fauci, the longtime leader of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been telling the president repeatedly that developing the vaccine will take at least a year and a half – the same message conveyed by pharmaceutical executives. Apparently, Trump thought that simply repeating his request would change the outcome.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-ban-travel-backfired">Trump’s coronavirus ban on travel from the EU is backfiring already | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/trump-coronavirus-antivaxxer-vaccine">Continue reading...</a>

What we do know is that wherever possible, food banks will continue to provide the lifeline of emergency food for those in need. Of course, our main priority is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation. We’re working out how we can best support people as the situation develops.</p><p>But there is a limit to what food banks can do. We face logistical challenges of getting food to the thousands of people who need it most if the country goes into lockdown, as well as concerns around donation levels. All of this comes when food banks are already dealing with a record level of need for emergency food. As charities who respond to local emergencies, it’s not unusual for a food bank to have to adapt quickly – we saw this in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/16/storm-dennis-prompts-life-threatening-flood-warnings-in-south-wales" title="">Pontypridd just last month</a>, when the local food bank acted quickly to help local people affected by the flooding. We saw it in London in the summer of 2017, when local food banks worked swiftly to help families facing the terrible consequences of Grenfell. And I know we will see it again in the coming months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/food-banks-coronavirus-universal-credit">Continue reading...</a>

## Is My Dark Vanessa the most controversial novel of the year? Author Kate Elizabeth Russell speaks out

<p>Exploring issues of abuse and consent, Russell’s novel My Dark Vanessa could not be more timely. She talks about the pressure to write a ‘likeable’ victim and the line between fiction and memoir</p><p>When, in 2018, Kate Elizabeth Russell’s agent presented publishers with her first novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/02/are-novelists-obliged-to-tell-the-story-of-their-private-life" title="">My Dark Vanessa</a></em>, about a sexual relationship between a 15-year-old girl and her English teacher, the #MeToo movement was in full flight. As women across the world were sharing stories and exposing the ways men had used power to abuse and silence them, here was a book, 18 years in the writing, that examined themes of consent, coercion, memory and the nature of victimhood. Initially, Russell was anxious about the timing. “I didn’t want to come across as opportunistic or have it cheapen my work somehow,” she recalls. “But then I realised those worries were about how people might perceive it and not about what my book was. And I really believed that I had written a good book and that I had something meaningful to contribute.”</p><p>But there were greater anxieties to come. In January this year, the author Wendy Ortiz criticised Russell’s substantial publishing deal and suggested the book’s plot was “eerily similar” to her own 2014 memoir, <em>Excavation</em>, which described how she was groomed by a teacher when she was 13. Ortiz, a Californian of Mexican descent, tweeted about how she had struggled to get published on account of the “difficult” subject matter. She complained that in “an industry that is continually taken to task for being extremely white and making decisions that reflect as much, here is a seven-figure book deal for a fiction book that is being marketed similarly to my book”. Russell emailed Ortiz and offered to send her a copy of <em>My Dark Vanessa </em>(Ortiz admitted she hadn’t read it), but she didn’t get a reply.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/13/kate-elizabeth-russell-my-dark-vanessa-interview">Continue reading...</a>

For months beforehand, families who live in poverty-stricken areas save to buy extravagant ballgowns and tuxedos, and to hire limousines for the big night.

In the murky world of Guerrilla – part war diary, part family memoir – acquiring an anti-aircraft missile is cause for celebration. “That thing symbolised a good time for people in the rebellion,” Nazar explains. “They didn’t have to be so scared of airstrikes because they had an umbrella over them.”</p><p>The son of a general in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/feb/23/victoriabrittain" title="">Jonas Savimbi’s Unita rebel group</a>, Nazar was born in Belgium in 1993. He grew up in the relative safety of suburban Brussels – barring a foiled kidnap attempt on his sister and the spectre of street gangs – as the Angolan civil war raged. After the nation became independent from Portugal in 1975, it was engulfed in a war between the communist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPLA" title="">People’s Movement for the Liberation of Angola</a> (MPLA) and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNITA" title="UNITA">National Union for the Total Independence of Angola</a> (Unita), <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/05/angola-brutal-history-mpla-leftwing-discipline-betrayal" title="">backed by Reagan and the CIA</a>. Nazar’s mother worked two jobs to keep the family in a middle-class neighbourhood. When peace came to Angola in 2002 after nearly three decades of fighting and the loss of an estimated 500,000 lives, the family moved back and Nazar encountered his homeland for the first time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/13/from-bombs-to-beats-how-nazar-summed-up-the-sound-of-angola">Continue reading...</a>
