Many of those initially infected either worked or frequently shopped in the Huanan seafood wholesale market in the centre of the Chinese city of Wuhan. Unusually for a virus that has made the jump from one species to another, it appears to transmit effectively in humans \u2013 current estimates show that without strong containment measures the average person who catches Covid-19 will pass it on to two others. The virus also appears to have a higher mortality rate than common illnesses such as seasonal flu. The combination of coronavirus\u2019s ability to spread and cause serious illness has prompted many countries, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\">including the UK</a>, to introduce or plan extensive public health measures aimed at containing and limiting the impact of the epidemic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-facts-is-there-a-cure-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate-of-the-virus\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-facts-is-there-a-cure-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate-of-the-virus", "date_published": "2020-03-13 09:49:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Bull & Bear Manchester: \u2018A little unispiring\u2018 \u2013 restaurant review | Grace Dent", "description": "<p>The beautifully restored former stock exchange is now home to Tom Kerridge\u2019s latest restaurant.

She talks about the pressure to write a \u2018likeable\u2019 victim and the line between fiction and memoir</p><p>When, in 2018, Kate Elizabeth Russell\u2019s agent presented publishers with her first novel, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/02/are-novelists-obliged-to-tell-the-story-of-their-private-life\" title=\"\">My Dark Vanessa</a></em>, about a sexual relationship between a 15-year-old girl and her English teacher, the #MeToo movement was in full flight. As women across the world were sharing stories and exposing the ways men had used power to abuse and silence them, here was a book, 18 years in the writing, that examined themes of consent, coercion, memory and the nature of victimhood. Initially, Russell was anxious about the timing. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to come across as opportunistic or have it cheapen my work somehow,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut then I realised those worries were about how people might perceive it and not about what my book was. And I really believed that I had written a good book and that I had something meaningful to contribute.\u201d</p><p>But there were greater anxieties to come. In January this year, the author Wendy Ortiz criticised Russell\u2019s substantial publishing deal and suggested the book\u2019s plot was \u201ceerily similar\u201d to her own 2014 memoir, <em>Excavation</em>, which described how she was groomed by a teacher when she was 13. Ortiz, a Californian of Mexican descent, tweeted about how she had struggled to get published on account of the \u201cdifficult\u201d subject matter. She complained that in \u201can industry that is continually taken to task for being extremely white and making decisions that reflect as much, here is a seven-figure book deal for a fiction book that is being marketed similarly to my book\u201d. Russell emailed Ortiz and offered to send her a copy of <em>My Dark Vanessa </em>(Ortiz admitted she hadn\u2019t read it), but she didn\u2019t get a reply.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/13/kate-elizabeth-russell-my-dark-vanessa-interview\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/13/kate-elizabeth-russell-my-dark-vanessa-interview", "date_published": "2020-03-13 09:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The new equality: proposing marriage ... simultaneously", "description": "<p>Like double rainbows, double proposals feel unexpected and delightful, and they allow couples to tailor their engagement to suit their values</p><p>I hope I\u2019m not giving too much away by saying that episode three of Netflix\u2019s slaphappy romantic reality show Love is Blind opens with a proposal.
