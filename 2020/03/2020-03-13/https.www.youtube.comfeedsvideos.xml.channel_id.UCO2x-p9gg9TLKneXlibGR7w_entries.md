Microsoft in the mid-2000s just couldn't get things right. While Xbox 360 was doing well, Windows Vista was a spectacular disaster and the launch of the iPhone and Google Android ultimately pushed Microsoft and the Windows Phone operating system out of the market. But a few years before that there was Zune: a portable MP3 player brave enough to take on the iPod. Did it work? Clearly not... Why, however, was Microsoft's music player such a failure and why did it cost them over a billion dollars in losses?
