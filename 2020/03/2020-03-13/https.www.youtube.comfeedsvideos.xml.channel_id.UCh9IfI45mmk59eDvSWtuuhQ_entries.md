Also hey okay -- cable news is designed to be scary but the COVID-19 coronavirus is serious business - WASH YOUR FREAKIN’ hands and stay home if you can. Even if you’re young and healthy you can carry the virus to people that are not (even if you’re not showing symptoms.) Don’t panic but stay informed. Love y’all and be safe.
