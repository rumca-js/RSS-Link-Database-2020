But parents are up against online gaming giants who specifically target young users, luring them in with addictive attractions and blurring the line between free and chargeable goodies. The games have been dubbed \u201cbait apps\u201d because they incentivise children to buy virtual accessories on their parents\u2019 cards while playing. In 2014 the US Federal Trade Commission ordered Apple to pay out $32.3m (\u00a324.6m) to reimburse American parents for unauthorised app purchases made by their children. Some children had run up bills of several thousand dollars, many of them unaware they were spending real money, while parents were equally unaware a single click could debit their bank card. Banks are supposed to reimburse customers for unauthorised transactions, but only if they have not been negligent with their card and security details. Arguably, parents who allow their children access to their logins, albeit unwittingly, are negligent.
