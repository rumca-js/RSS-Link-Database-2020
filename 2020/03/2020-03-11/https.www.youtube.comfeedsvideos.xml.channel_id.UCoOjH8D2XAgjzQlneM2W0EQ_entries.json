That sounds all good but how would anyone be okay with giving the government that much power to make the lives of big businesses easier?\u201d\nInstead of proclaiming to everyone our monopolistic intentions, we just say that it\u2019s in the \u201cpublic\u2019s best interest\u201d\nWe tell the world and congress that we need gov to protect consumers from greedy, unsafe businesses\nWe need to learn the game of crony capitalism\n\nIn 1998 Microsoft was the biggest company in the world, the most innovative companies in the world\nMicrosoft and Bill Gates thought that \u201cbusiness is going great, our customers love our products\u201d\nThey spent zero dollars on lobbying or cronyism\nWhen politicians kept seeing just how much money Microsoft was making Bill Gates is called into the Senate\nAnd six months later, Microsoft got another knock on the door from the Justice Department\nMicrosoft was found guilty for giving away a product for free and spent the next nearly 10 years fighting that case, devoting time, resources, and lots of money to it\nIf you're making money and you don\u2019t pander to the politicians, they'll come to your door, so why not profit from it too?\n\nThe other big tech companies have learned from Microsoft\u2019s mistakes and now take a more offensive approach\nAmazon was facing a lot of bad press about their low minimum wage, so Jeff Bezos raised the minimum wage to $15 for all Amazon workers and announced that he\u2019ll be lobbying Congress to increase the minimum wage\nAKA, he's gently bribing politicians to allow the  government to force his competitors expenses up \n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
