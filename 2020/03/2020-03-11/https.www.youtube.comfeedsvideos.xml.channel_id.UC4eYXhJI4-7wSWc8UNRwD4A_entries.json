An outspoken activist, teacher and mentor, she is also the founder and artistic director of the Berklee Institute of Jazz and Gender Justice, a multidisciplinary program whose motto is \"Jazz Without Patriarchy.\"\n\nCarrington visited the Desk with her current band, Social Science, a collaboration with pianist Aaron Parks and guitarist Matthew Stevens (both performing here). In the works for some time, their project culminated in 2016 when the cultural divisiveness brought on by the presidential election inspired the trio to take action. \"I think there's an awakening happening in society in general,\" Carrington writes on her website, \"I feel a calling in my life to merge my artistry with any form of activism that I'm able to engage in.\"\n\nThis performance features music from the band's new album, Waiting Game. It's story-filled, groove-music performed by a group of accomplished musicians who improvise, rap and sing over complex but highly crafted and accessible instrumental motifs. A perfect synthesis of jazz, indie rock and hip-hop influences, the four songs they played address important, culturally relevant protest narratives: mass incarceration, collective liberation, police brutality and Native American genocide.\n\nThe third tune, \"Bells (Ring Loudly),\" written by Parks and Carrington, features actor Malcolm Jamal Warner who also wrote the spoken word. Carrington had just seen the Philando Castile shooting and her powerful lyrics imagined what she would say to the offending police officer.\n\n\"You took my love away from me.\nI wanna know how did it feel to watch him tremble and bleed.\nTell me what gives you the right to kill so senselessly?\nAnd when you're alone do you ever think of him or pray for his peace?\"\n\n\"There is so much we can be angry about but you can't really stay there,\" Carrington told NPR. \"Instead, you can reach somebody on a human level.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Trapped In The American Dream ft.
