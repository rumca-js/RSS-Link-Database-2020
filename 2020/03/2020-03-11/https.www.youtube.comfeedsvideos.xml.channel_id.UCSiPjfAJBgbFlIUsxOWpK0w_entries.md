LYRICS

Baby how you feelin’

I do my hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin’
Feelin’ good as hell
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin’

Oo child
When I wake up in the morning, love
Keep it movin’ yes Lord
And the sunlight hurts my eyes
Oo child
And something without warning, love
Keep it movin’ yes Lord
Bears heavy on my mind

Then I look at you
If he don’t love you anymore
It’s alright with me
Just walk your fine ass out that door
Just one look at you
If he don’t love you anymore
And I know it's gonna be
Yeah I know it’s gonna be

A lovely day
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin’
Feelin’ good as hell
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
A lovely day
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin’
Feelin’ good as hell
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day

Come now, come dry your eyes
You know you a star, you can touch the sky
I know that it's hard but you have to try
If you need advice, let me simplify

If he don’t love you anymore
Just walk your fine ass out that door

A lovely day
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin’
Feelin’ good as hell
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
A lovely day
Hair toss
Check my nails
Baby how you feelin’
Feelin’ good as hell
Lovely day
Lovely day
Lovely day
