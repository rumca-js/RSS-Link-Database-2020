As the final character for the current Kombat Pack, he follows in the footsteps of other guest characters like The Terminator and The Joker, who incorporate their unique personalities and combat styles into the MK universe. Recently, we had the chance to go hands-on with Spawn, and we certainly got to see his abrasive and no-nonsense personality in full display.\n\nEver since his debut in 1992, Spawn has never been one to mince words. When he's confronted with a character that rubs him the wrong way, he'll be sure to let them know outright. In this video, we've mashed up some of the most vulgar and meanest fight intros from Spawn in Mortal Kombat 11. Voiced by Keith David, the same actor who portrayed the character in the HBO animated series from 1997, the undead fighter lets loose with insults and the hostilities when facing off against the likes of The Joker and Shao Kahn.\n\nIn addition to the new character, this next update for Mortal Kombat 11 will also introduce new Matinee-themed costumes for Jacqui Briggs, Kotal Kahn, and Erron Black inspired by pulp-adventure serials from the 1930s. Along with that, Jacqui Briggs will get another outfit inspired by Spawn, giving her the appearance of a hellspawn as well.\n\nSpawn is the final character of the current Kombat Pack for Mortal Kombat 11, and he'll be available to current owners on March 17, while non-Kombat Pack owners will be able to purchase him separately on March 24.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nvIKoCbzWo", "date_published": "2020-03-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Super Mario Lego - It's Lego Mario Time Trailer", "description": "LEGO and Mario finally team up!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lin_rdw82HE", "date_published": "2020-03-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Let\u2019s Play Ori And The Will Of The Wisps", "description": "The long-awaited sequel to Ori And The Blind Forest, Ori And The Will Of The Wisps is out today on Xbox One and PC, and available on Xbox Game Pass.

We recently had the chance to get some hands-on time with the last character of the current Kombat Pack, and he's certainly made the transition well into Netherrealm Studios' violent and over-the-top fighting game.\n\nIn this video, we pulled together some of the greatest hits of Spawn's appearance in Mortal Kombat 11, highlighting his cinematics, fatalities, brutalities, and even his extremely elaborate fatal blow attack. Right from his intro, where you see him perched atop a church rooftop, it's clear that Spawn faithfully recreated in the fighting game. Spawn uses both conventional weapons and demonic powers, which makes his combat style a mix of ranged moves and skills that get up close and personal. His iconic chains and cape also come into play, with some grotesque results.\n\nIn addition to the new character, this next update for Mortal Kombat 11 will also introduce new Matinee-themed costumes for Jacqui Briggs, Kotal Kahn, and Erron Black inspired by pulp-adventure serials from the 1930s.

Not only that, but if successful, Warzone could potentially impact and influence the entire video game industry.\n\nIn a new video, Eddie Makuch looks into how Activision is trying to have its cake and eat it too with Warzone. Activision will continue to release big new Call of Duty games that it charges $60 for every year, on top of making even more money from Warzone (and this is to say nothing of the huge amount of money that Call of Duty: Mobile brings in every month). \n\nBut some questions remain. If Warzone sparks fire and catches on, is Activision running the risk of cannibalizing future Call of Duty games? Will Warzone's free-to-play label change how fans view the franchise? Will Activision release a new battle royale game for the franchise's yearly instalments?
