## Sudan Archives - Nont For Sale (Live at The Current)

"Nont For Sale," off her 2018 Stones Throw EP 'Sink' is a track that feels like a good example of Sudan Archives' thesis: how can you arrange different musical communities into a singular force? The song features formidable electronic production, delicate violin plucks, and a medley of soulful croons and snappy neo-rap flows. Three contrasting tones synthesized into — to put it plainly — one incredibly cool sound.
