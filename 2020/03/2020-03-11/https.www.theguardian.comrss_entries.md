<p>Paris Saint-Germain beat Borussia Dortmund 2-0 in a Champions League last-16 second leg to reach the quarter-finals 3-2 on aggregate. The match was played behind closed doors because of coronavirus fears, with many PSG fans congregating outside the Parc des Princes stadium instead.</p><p>Neymar and Juan Bernat scored before half-time to overturn a 2-1 first-leg deficit and send the French champions into the last eight for the first time since 2016. Dortmund finished with 10 men after Emre Can was sent off in the dying minutes for a clash with Neymar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/11/paris-saint-germain-borussia-dortmund-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Politicians and pundits reacted to the spending with awe. But this budget only gives more to those who already have more<p>Few jobs are as much fun as being chancellor with £30bn to hand out. For proof, you just had to watch Rishi Sunak this afternoon. Not yet 40, as dapper as a guest at a swanky wedding and presenting his first-ever budget, he wore a giant grin plastered over his unlined face.</p><p>Sure, the new boy – on only his 27th day at No 11 – began soberly enough, even trying some Grown-Up Talk about working with opposition MPs on the coronavirus pandemic. But that was swiftly replaced with the usual polemic: jibing at John McDonnell’s “fantasy” economics, declaring “a new era” for the country, and even leading Tory MPs in an extraordinary call-and-response chant on how their government was getting things done. That was a trick lifted straight out of the book of Boris Johnson – and more directly than any other chancellor we’ve seen in the past 10 years of Conservative rule, Sunak used his outing as an audition for the top job.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/johnsonism-first-budget-hype-spending">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Criminal cases review commission approves fresh appeal over 1988 atrocity</p><p>A grievous miscarriage of justice – described by some as the worst in British legal history – may have occurred in the conviction of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi for the Lockerbie bombing, the Scottish criminal cases review commission has found.</p><p>The SCCRC approved an application to refer Megrahi’s conviction back to the appeal court on Wednesday following an application by the lawyer Aamer Anwar on behalf of Megrahi’s family. The application was supported by some families of those who died in the 1988 disaster.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/11/lockerbie-bomber-conviction-may-have-been-miscarriage-of-justice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Complicated and costly? Think again. Driving a hybrid vehicle is a practical way to reduce emissions while being economical and fuss-free, say experts</p><p>As awareness of the climate crisis grows and urban pollution levels creep ever higher, we’re all starting to think more about our carbon footprints. For those who are considering buying a car, which one to go with requires careful thought and research.</p><p>Should we stick with petrol or diesel, take the plunge to buy an electric vehicle or maybe opt for a hybrid? Of these options, there tends to be the most confusion around hybrids. There are a lot of myths about these vehicles, many of them based on the early, less sophisticated versions that entered the market about 20 years ago. But it’s worth busting through these concerns and getting to grips with what hybrids can offer, as for many of us they can be an excellent choice for greener, more economical and fun motoring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thehybridhero/2020/mar/11/hybrid-cars-have-to-be-plugged-in-and-five-other-common-misconceptions">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Cheer to Christopher John Rogers, the term has come to define survival in the face of white privilege</p><p>In the first episode of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/25/pose-ryan-murphy-new-show-about-voguing-is-tv-at-its-most-fearless" title="">Pose</a> – the hit drama about the 80s ballroom drag scene that gave birth to vogueing – a group from the House of Abundance break into a museum exhibition of Elizabethan-era clothes. They strip the mannequins, stuff the corsets and ruffs into shiny black bin bags, then escape through a smashed window to the ball competition. “The category is Bring it like Royalty,” says the MC, Billy Porter as the gang walk and pose in their Renaissance era garments. They win the competition, but their victory is about not only looking great whatever the cost, but also about breaking with convention, law and history.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/16/cheer-netflix-breathtaking-bone-crunching-nerve-racking-magic" title="">Cheer</a>, Netflix’s docudrama about a competitive cheerleading squad, the breakout stars are Jerry Harris and La’Darius Marshall. Unapologetically exuberant, the black, gay teenagers in Republican-supporting, gun-toting Navarro, Texas, should stick out like sore, if deeply fabulous, thumbs. Yet Cheer becomes a story of how they survived grief (the premature death of Jerry’s mum and La’Darius’s suicide attempt) and accepted themselves. In both shows, as black and Latino members of the LGBTQI community, these characters are outside mainstream society and so have created their own. In this world “being fabulous” is not just the defining quality, but acts as a challenge to the status quo and (white, entitled, birthright) privilege.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/11/yas-kweens-the-political-importance-of-being-fabulous">Continue reading...</a>

## Making a killing: what can novels teach us about getting away with murder?

<p>From Agatha Christie to Gillian Flynn, readers love an untraceable method or a villain who wins. Author Peter Swanson says there are eight examples of the perfect murder</p><p>Is there such a thing as a perfect murder? In real life, the answer is probably yes, though how would we know about it? Perfection demands that the murder be unsolvable, maybe even unrecorded – a victim disappearing off the face of the earth, a body never found, a killer never caught. In our world of forensic science and DNA evidence, the perfect murder must be as rare as a reclusive celebrity.<br /><br />But we have fiction, and this is where we find an abundance of perfect murder attempts. I say attempts because the allure of most detective fiction hinges on the existence of an investigator – a Holmes, a Poirot, a Lisbeth Salander – who is smarter than the smartest of criminals. The perfect murder – like a perfect sonnet or a perfect roast chicken – is an ideal that can be approached but never entirely reached. Detectives, and storytelling tradition, get in the way.<br /><br />When I set out to write a book in which a bookseller publishes a blog about his favourite fictional murders, only to find out that someone else is using the list as a blueprint for real crimes, I knew that part of the process of writing was going to be a whole lot of reading. So I set out to find a definitive list of perfect crimes and came up with a final tally of eight (or rather, my narrator Malcolm Kershaw did).</p><p>Christie's use of thallium as a fatal poison in The Pale Horse caused a brief uptick in the toxin’s presence in real-life crime</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/11/killing-inside-tricks-for-pulling-off-a-perfect-murder-plot-peter-swanson">Continue reading...</a>

Infrastructure is a red herring. To stay in power, Boris Johnson must invest in the institution that is ‘in Britain’s blood’<p>This is the budget that Downing Street hoped would demonstrate to its new voters that they were right to place their trust in the Conservatives. Instead, it has become the coronavirus budget, with No 10’s message to voters in the north and the Midlands half-postponed while the Treasury tries to protect the economy.</p><p>But the moment to reassure those new voters will come eventually. Until now, the government has signalled that its view of how to do this is through “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/levelling-up-let-tories-off-hook-conservative-policies" title="">levelling up</a>” the country – improving infrastructure, transport links and high streets outside of London and the south.

It is the stuff of many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2015/may/27/five-ted-talks-that-will-change-the-way-you-work" title="">Ted Talks</a> and muscular films and popular books. If the adversity includes wildness and the elements, even better. A shark, a self-amputated arm, a bear or two. I do not mock. I enjoyed Claire Nelson’s book and it is valuable. This is no misery memoir, but a thoughtful exploration of what happens when a human being is removed from all that keeps her safe, with no hope of rescue – and how she survives that shock.</p><p>Nelson, a New Zealander, was a magazine sub-editor in London with a life filled with friends, drinking, socialising. But her friends kept departing for other countries and continents, and she was left with the other aspects of London life: emptiness and ennui. She followed her friends and left, moving to Canada, then to two weeks’ housesitting in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/apr/12/joshua-tree-national-park-art-music-california-coachella" title="">Joshua Tree</a> in the California desert.

## My kids spent £600 on their iPads without my knowledge

<p>Apple wouldn’t help and Roblox cancelled both their accounts. Neither is particularly helpful</p><p><strong>My nine and eight-year-old kids spent £602 via my iTunes account buying merchandise from the online gaming platform Roblox. I hadn’t realised my bank card would be available to use on my children’s iPads. When I discovered the spending spree I contacted Apple for a goodwill refund. The answer was: “Sorry we can’t help you but do have a nice day.” I then explained my predicament to Roblox. Their response was to terminate my children’s accounts, without any warning on the grounds that they “take fraud very seriously”. My kids are heartbroken because they’ve spent their own savings for years on Roblox, building up an incredible collection of armoury and clothing. As my nine-year-old eloquently put it: “My whole life is now ruined.” <em>JD Brighton</em></strong></p><p>To non-parents, this sounds like staggering incompetence on your part. But parents are up against online gaming giants who specifically target young users, luring them in with addictive attractions and blurring the line between free and chargeable goodies. The games have been dubbed “bait apps” because they incentivise children to buy virtual accessories on their parents’ cards while playing. In 2014 the US Federal Trade Commission ordered Apple to pay out $32.3m (£24.6m) to reimburse American parents for unauthorised app purchases made by their children. Some children had run up bills of several thousand dollars, many of them unaware they were spending real money, while parents were equally unaware a single click could debit their bank card. Banks are supposed to reimburse customers for unauthorised transactions, but only if they have not been negligent with their card and security details. Arguably, parents who allow their children access to their logins, albeit unwittingly, are negligent. One father reported his son to the police in hopes a crime reference number would help him reclaim £3,700 that his 13-year-old son unwittingly spent on his iPad.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/11/my-kids-spent-600-on-their-ipads-without-my-knowledge">Continue reading...</a>

## Rishi Sunak's impossible task: sticking to a plan Johnson doesn't have | Rafael Behr

<p>The chancellor’s first budget is a tall order, but Boris Johnson can trust him not to challenge the upbeat storytelling</p><p>This time last year, it was hard to imagine anything ruining a chancellor’s plans more than Brexit was disturbing Philip Hammond’s. But that was a different era. Hammond had not been exiled from the Tory party, no one had heard of the coronavirus, supermarkets had ample <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/coronavirus-stockpiling-supermarkets-toilet-paper-hand-gel" title="">supplies of toilet paper</a>, and Rishi Sunak was a mere parliamentary undersecretary of state at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government.</p><p>Sunak’s rapid ascent to the job of chancellor gives him status, not stature, and he goes into his first budget with authority already diminished by the circumstances of his promotion. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/javid-resigned-after-johnson-pushed-him-to-sack-advisers" title="">Sajid Javid resigned</a> rather than surrender his Treasury advisers to a command-and-control structure based in Downing Street. By accepting the job on terms that were unacceptable to his predecessor, Sunak advertised himself as the most submissive chancellor in living memory. If he has an independent streak, he keeps it covered in public. He is fluent in that polystyrene dialect that politicians use to pad out space in interviews when they would rather say nothing. That makes it hard to distinguish between caginess and mediocrity. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/03/09/rishi-sunak-right-man-face-economic-challenges-ahead/" title="">Sunak’s friends laud</a> his intelligence but to the outsider he is unimpressive, which is what impressed Johnson about him. The prime minister knows that governments need capable managers but he is also vain enough to prefer the meek brand of competence that does not encroach on his limelight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/11/rishi-sunak-spend-tax-chancellor-budget-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three drama school productions highlight the appeal for established names in sharing passion projects with actors flexing their performance muscles</p><p>‘Strap in, lads.” The Scottish playwright <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/mar/28/nora-a-dolls-house-review-stef-smith-tramway-feminist-rewrite">Stef Smith</a> is giving the cast some new lines for her contemporary version of Antigone. People sharpen their pencils, grab their rehearsal scripts. For most of the actors it’s their first experience of working with a living writer. These final-year students at Guildhall School of Music and Drama are preparing the ambitious new text, one of several big shows designed to flex their performance muscles, often with prominent directors. For Antigone it’s Orla O’Loughlin, who after leading Edinburgh’s Traverse is now director of drama at GSMD. Bright-eyed, hoop earrings shimmying, she’s among the directors whose student productions may not be reviewed or widely seen but will nonetheless influence future British theatre. What are the artistic rewards? How is it different from a professional show?<br /><br />By their third and final year, students form a tight mesh. “They’ve lived and worked together at close quarters,” O’Loughlin tells me. “They’ve grown up together” but “they’re very vulnerable, they’re still young. I feel remarkably tiger mum about it! I want to protect them as well as prepare them for the industry.”<br /><br />“I like to work under the radar,” says Jade Lewis. At the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (Lamda), she directs a play she knows inside out – as assistant director, she followed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/01/nine-night-review-dorfman-national-theatre-london">Nine Night</a> by Natasha Gordon from National Theatre to West End. “Now it’s less about discovering what the play means, and more about what <em>our </em>version will mean,” she says. “This is an actor’s play and they’ll have to create their own journeys. My plan is to treat them as if they were professionals – I want them to have that experience.”</p><p>So what’s different? Casting, for a start. Roles are allotted by staff, not visiting directors, and most of these actors are yet to know the midlife frets of Nine Night, let alone Oscar Wilde’s Lady Bracknell. Where a professional show is “ultimately about the finished product”, O’Loughlin explains, with “seats to fill, tickets to sell”, here the process is as crucial as the product. “We must be ambitious for students,” she says, “but not expect them to know what they don’t know yet.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/11/i-want-to-protect-and-prepare-them-why-student-shows-attract-starry-directors">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Local government is on the frontline of the climate crisis and coronavirus. The chancellor needs to fund more than disaster relief</p><p>“Brave!” was how colleagues responded when the Conservative leader of Warwick district council, Andrew Day, told them he was going to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/05/warwick-proposes-34-council-tax-rise-to-fund-climate-action-plans" title="">hold a referendum</a> to see if local residents would accept an increase in council tax to pay for a local climate emergency action plan. That’s “brave” as in “foolhardy”.</p><p>It is accepted wisdom that residents will never vote for tax rises. The Bedfordshire police commissioner held a referendum in 2016 to see if voters would back higher council tax to pay for 100 extra police officers. He was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32694166" title="">trounced</a>. A year later Surrey county council, drowning in cuts, thought about <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-surrey-38895493" title="">proposing a 15% rise</a> to fund social care and children’s services, but backed off. No one else has dared test the legislation brought in by Eric Pickles in 2012 <a href="https://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05682#fullreport" title="">requiring councils to get voter permission</a> for “excessive” council tax rises.

## Closed borders and ‘black weddings’: what the 1918 flu teaches us about coronavirus

<p>The influenza of 1918 killed up to 100 million people. What lessons does it offer for our current health crisis?</p><p>Plagues – or, to use a more modern term, epidemics of infectious disease – pluck at our most primal fears. We have lived with them for at least 10,000 years, ever since our ancestors took up farming and built the first semi-permanent settlements. And they have always had the upper hand. They know us intimately, preying on our strengths – our sociability, our love of gossip – and turning them into weaknesses. They are always a step ahead, and once they are out, like the genie, we can’t get them back in. All we can do is limit the damage. So here we are again.</p><p>Because epidemics are frightening, it is hardly surprising that people reach for the worst possible historic comparison. The 1918 influenza pandemic, which has been distilled in the public imagination to a single black-and-white image of bedridden US soldiers, has been hauled out of mothballs to do duty as a template of what we might expect from Covid-19. But is that global human catastrophe, which killed between 50 million and 100 million people – the vast majority in the developing world – and which was largely forgotten for most of the last century, the right comparison to make?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/closed-borders-and-black-weddings-what-the-1918-flu-teaches-us-about-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

I didn’t know that at the time.
