Leagues will need to be restructured drastically when the 2019-20 season resumes. There is also the issue of expiring contracts, with clubs potentially offering short-term extensions to players who would otherwise leave before the season concludes. Some players have already signed pre-contract deals with other clubs and are due to make their moves in June.</p><p>Whatever happens, with so much uncertainty over the summer transfer window, those teams who had secured new signatures in preparation for the next campaign will be pleased to have done so. Here are five notable signings and the roles they will play for their new clubs when football eventually returns.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/who-scored-blog/2020/mar/25/footballers-already-agreed-switch-clubs-summer-transfer-window">Continue reading...</a>

It wasn’t serious, but I got free beer.”</p><p>With long dark hair and mixed ancestry (Latin American on her father’s side, Native American and Welsh on her mother’s) she had the perfect beatnik look, and a trek around Europe in the early 60s eventually led her to become a long-term UK resident, ending up with two BBC TV series of her own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/25/julie-felix-10-of-her-greatest-performances">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a teenager I had chronic hypochondria. Yet in the face of a global pandemic I am surprisingly calm. Maybe it’s because we are all in this together</p><p>I have noticed something odd about my anxiety at this time: I am not as anxious as I should be. I have been anxious for as long as I can remember: man, boy, child, baby and, for all I know, foetus. It just seems to be in my nature. I have a physical manifestation of it in the shape of a long furrow right across the middle of my brow. If I pull the skin on my forehead right back to stretch away this crevice, a white streak appears in its place. For this troubled trench is so deep that no sunlight finds a way to its depths.</p><p>When I was a kid, I worried about everything. I worried whether my friends liked me, whether girls liked me and, most of all, whether West Brom would win their next game. I worried about my grandparents dying and my parents dying. And, logically enough, by the time I got to my teens I started to worry about dying myself. This manifested itself in chronic hypochondria. I was convinced I had pretty much everything at some time or other, but the main focus of my concern was my testicles. To be fair, I had nearly lost them when I was 11 in a bicycle crash at my nan’s house on the day of the 1978 cup final, but that’s another story.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/i-was-born-anxious-so-why-am-i-not-panicking-about-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When a doctor runs for office in Saudi Arabia, her campaign gathers unexpected momentum in this assured drama by Wadjda director Haifaa Al Mansour</p><p>With oil no longer at the premium it was, and Saudi Arabia’s government reportedly compelled to make concessions to western-style novelties such as feminism, we have seen something of an opening up. In the movies, that has given us the work of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/jul/14/haifaa-mansour-wadjda-saudi-arabia">Haifaa Al Mansour</a>, the first woman to make a Saudi Arabian feature film with her widely admired 2012 debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/18/wadjda-review">Wadjda</a>, about a 10-year-old girl who enters a Koran-reading competition so she can buy a bike with the cash prize.</p><p>Now Al Mansour has directed and co-written this assured and watchable picture, which premiered last year in Venice: a political drama about a woman who runs for office quasi-accidentally, in the time-honoured style, and then finds her campaign gaining an unexpected momentum. No one in this film actually calls her the “perfect” candidate; an alternative title would have been just “The Candidate”, like Robert Redford in Michael Ritchie’s 1972 film, who is allowed to take a shot at political power because the powers-that-be are confident he hasn’t got a hope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/25/the-perfect-candidate-review-saudi-arabia-haifaa-mansour-mila-al-zahrani">Continue reading...</a>

Instead, that morning the nurse called to let me know non-patients wouldn’t be allowed to enter the hospital.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/pregnant-during-coronavirus-pandemic-how-will-it-affect-me-and-my-baby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joe Moran looks at books on how to keep calm in times of adversity - and take joy where we find it </p><p>The coronavirus has put life on hold. In this time of fractured human contact and fear of the unknown, we need to read authors who will embolden us for the hard season ahead, while also offering a calming sense of perspective.</p><p>Eula Biss’s book-length<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/24/on-immunity-an-inoculation-eula-biss-review"> essay </a><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/24/on-immunity-an-inoculation-eula-biss-review">On Immunity </a></strong>does the trick. She begins with the story of Achilles, whose mother dipped him in the river Styx only to leave the vulnerable spot on his heel where she held him. The story’s moral, in Biss’s words, is that “immunity is a myth … and no mortal can ever be made invulnerable”. And yet she admits that she found this message hard to accept after the birth of her son in 2009 – especially when, shortly afterwards, the swine flu epidemic began. Biss explores how hard it is for even the most clear-eyed of us not to succumb to panic and dread.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/25/dont-panic-the-best-books-to-help-us-survive-a-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

## Mass testing is the only way to stop the virus – it's long overdue | Anthony Costello

<p>The 15-minute coronavirus tests may provide a semblance of normality as UK regions track the spread of coronavirus</p><p>• Anthony Costello is a former director of maternal and child health at the World Health Organization</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the World Health Organization (WHO) has emphasised the crucial importance of testing. Speed is of the essence, and three things are crucial: tracking down cases with symptoms; identifying their household cluster and tracing people they’ve contacted; and quarantining them until they are no longer infectious. Testing is the basis of public health detective work to shut down an epidemic. “You can’t fight a virus if you don’t know where it is,” said the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus<strong>,</strong> recently. “<a href="https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/transcripts/who-transcript-emergencies-coronavirus-press-conference-full-13mar2020848c48d2065143bd8d07a1647c863d6b.pdf?sfvrsn=23dd0b04_2">Find, isolate, test and treat every case</a>, to break the chains of transmission. Every case we find and treat limits the expansion of the disease.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/23/how-to-social-distance-tips-convince-friends-family">Physical distancing</a> is another strategy, but it’s less effective than testing. In the early stages of an epidemic, when clusters are few and far between, one needs a huge population distancing effort to stop their spread. At that point, most people won’t grasp the scale of the threat and will resist restrictive orders. So testing, contact tracing and quarantining people with symptoms is crucial. As the epidemic becomes rampant, as in London, the policy must switch to intensive testing to protect health workers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/mass-covid-19-testing-is-vital-but-the-data-must-be-localised">Continue reading...</a>

## From Mané to Ings: awards of the Premier League season so far

<p>With football on hold we select some of the highlights of the top-flight campaign until now – and the biggest flop</p><p>Jordan Henderson’s influence deserves acclaim but Sadio Mané is remarkably consistent and reaches heights that his captain cannot. The temptation for players who can do it all is to overdo it, but Mané is too smart for that. He is the purest epitome of this Liverpool team because he is supremely efficient. Sometimes that means doing something as simple as running on to a long pass by Virgil van Dijk and slotting the ball past the keeper in the way he did for the winning goal against Bournemouth in Liverpool’s last domestic game before the suspension of the Premier League; and sometimes it means producing supernatural flourishes like his stoppage-time headed winning goal at Aston Villa or the touch that enabled him to take down a pass by Henderson while pirouetting past a defender before ramming the ball into the net against Norwich. Having the athleticism and skill to play as he does is rare; having the presence of mind to use those gifts with such effectively and selflessly is rarer still.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/25/awards-of-the-premier-league-season-so-far-sadio-mane-danny-ings">Continue reading...</a>

A tagine is simply <a href="https://theculturetrip.com/africa/morocco/articles/worlds-biggest-tagine-morocco/" title="">the name of the cooking pot in which the stews </a><a href="https://theculturetrip.com/africa/morocco/articles/worlds-biggest-tagine-morocco/" title="">are traditionally made,</a> rather than the name of a specific recipe (though these days, I’m assured, a saucepan or pressure cooker are more common in Moroccan homes).</p><p>And, as <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/nargisse-benkabbou-moroccan-food-global-authentic-casablanca-cook-book-a8324056.html" title="">Nargisse Benkabbou</a> explains in her book Casablanca, <a href="https://www.nadakiffa.com/2014/11/part-1-cooking-moroccan-stews-few.html" title="">there are four popular styles</a>, regardless of whether the main ingredient is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/28/goat-kid-recipes-fearnley-whittingstall" title="">goat</a>, <a href="http://www.mymoroccanfood.com/home/sardine-tagine-with-charmoula" title="">sardines</a> or <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/food/recipes/artichoke-and-pea-tagine-tajine-kok-and-jelbana" title="">artichokes</a>. These are <em>mqualli</em> cooked with olive oil, turmeric, ginger and saffron; <em>mhammer</em> made with butter, cumin and paprika; <em>mchermel</em> cooked with chermoula, a zingy herb paste; and one made with tomato, cumin and paprika. Each, Benkabbou says, “can be customised with seasonal vegetables, dried fruit, preserved lemons, olives and nuts”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/25/how-to-cook-the-perfect-vegetable-tagine-recipe">Continue reading...</a>
