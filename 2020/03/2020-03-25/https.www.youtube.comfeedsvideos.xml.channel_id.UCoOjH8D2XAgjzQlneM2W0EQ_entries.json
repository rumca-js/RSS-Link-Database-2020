Conceal the ownership and source of the money\n2. Change the money\u2019s form\n3. Obscure the financial trail\n4. Complete control over the process and the people to prevent skimming\n\nStep 1: Get the dirty money into the banking system\nOne popular way to go about doing this is by using legitimate businesses as fronts for your laundering\nBuy a restaurant, bar, retail store, or any other business that deals in a lot of cash, and carefully inject a little extra cash into the business\u2019s books every day\n\nStep 2: After dirty money is brought into the financial system, it\u2019s time to hose off all that dirt\nSet up a bunch of dummy shell companies around the world in areas where the economy is stable, and they don\u2019t enforce money laundering as heavily\nSend the money around the world to as many different accounts\n\nStep 3: Withdraw the newly washed money from your accounts back into circulation as sweet, taxable, and most importantly, legal income, that you can spend on whatever\nNo one will be able to trace the money back to you\n\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
