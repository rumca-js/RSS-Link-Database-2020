If you have ffmpeg and know how to use it, you don't need some enormous point and click video editor to do basic tasks. It can crop, resize, split, combine, interpolate, adjoin, readjust, stabilize, filter and everything else your videos. I've used ffmpeg exclusively for probably around the past two years of my YouTube channel.
