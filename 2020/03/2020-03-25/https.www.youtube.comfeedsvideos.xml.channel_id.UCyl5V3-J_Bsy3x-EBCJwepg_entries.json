Kyle and Ethan talk about stuff that\u2019s good and inform the listeners how to chase your hat with a life lesson from GK Chesterton.\r\n\r\n In the subscriber portion, Kyle and Ethan discuss the news media being so biased that it makes normal people defend Trump who otherwise wouldn\u2019t and how Tulsi Gabbard has been absorbed into the Borg collective and forced to support Joe Biden.\r\n\r\n  Pre-order the new Babylon Bee Best-Of Coffee Table Book coming in 2020!\r\n\r\n Show Outline\r\n\r\n Introduction - Ethan is the Samwise to Kyle\u2019s Frodo, the government is chasing us to enforce social distancing, and Kyle got to go to a mountain cabin in a winter wonderland.\r\n\r\n We now have a premium section on the website with exclusive articles and behind-the-scenes takes.

Chesterton On Running After Your Hat- How to have a sense of humor amidst tough circumstances and annoyances. Viewing things rightly.\r\n\r\n   The right way to view things -- to find objective truth and meaning in the chaos\r\n\r\n   Having the right perspective amid annoyance and inconvenience\r\n\r\n   This is far from the worst thing to ever happen to humanity\r\n\r\n   Just say, \u201cI\u2019m just chasing my hat\u201d in your daily life!\r\n\r\n   Love Mail/Hate Mail/ Feedback -  We are told that we need a calvinist on staff again...\r\n\r\n Paid-subscriber portion (Starts at 01:07:48)\r\n\r\n Story 1 -  'Joe Biden Is The Best Choice For Our Nation,' Chants Tulsi Gabbard After DNC Completes Assimilation Process\r\n\r\n   Tulsi Gabbard was anti-establishment until she wasn\u2019t. She was anti-war anti-interventionism and now she\u2019s telling people to vote for Iraq war supporting Joe Biden.\r\n\r\n   We remember when Ron Paul told everyone to go vote for a third party candidate. Any of them. \r\n\r\n   Story 2 -  Trump Says, 'I Don't Want Any Americans To Die', NYT Quotes As 'I... Want... Americans To Die'\r\n\r\n   The latest example of fake news. The New York Times changes its headline  three times to make the Democrats look better in the relief bill obstruction. Went from \u201cDemocrats Block\u2026\u201d to \u201cPartisan Divide\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n   Trump press conferences where reporters take him out of context to make the virus response super partisan and political and try to paint him in the worst light. \u201cThe virus is a hoax\u201d \u201cTrump is attacking the press.\u201d \u201cTrump didn\u2019t plan ahead or order supplies in time.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s response is delayed\u201d \u201cTrump disbanded the pandemic response team\u201d \u201cTrump cut funding to the CDC\u201d, etc... Trump tweeted out this fact check.\r\n\r\n    WaPo reporter apologized and deleted the tweet which made it sound like Trump was calling the virus a \u201choax.\u201d\r\n\r\n   Trump was saying two medicines taken together might prove to be of help for those suffering from the virus, but they\u2019re still looking into it.   NBC/Bloomberg ran a story about how if you take two grams of the substance, it will kill you. That would be like 4X the dosage though. A couple drank aquarium tank cleaner and reporters tried to blame Trump.\r\n\r\n    Become a paid subscriber at https://babylonbee.com/plans", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jCrTAE0I80", "date_published": "2020-03-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
