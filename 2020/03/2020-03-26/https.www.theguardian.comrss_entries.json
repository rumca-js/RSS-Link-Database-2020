In war, governments try to increase economic activity to produce weapons and are forced to tamp down inflation. Today governments deliberately want to lower economic activity to cut the risk of a virus transmission. Many Conservatives\u2019 key belief in free-market societies is that they reward the industrious and punish the idle. Yet the mass joblessness, income shortfalls and business failures we hear about are not because of any human flaw, but because of a government-led shutdown and the fear coursing through the economy. The upshot is that GDP will fall. However, we must not let this situation spiral out of control. Letting a shutdown that lowers aggregate demand lead to unemployment that further cuts demand could put the economy into a tailspin. What is needed is for people and firms to maintain cashflow and help with bills, until some semblance of normality returns.</p><p>While businesses have been bailed out, there has been a slower move to put money in the pockets of people. Last week the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government would pay 80% of the wages of the UK\u2019s 28 million private sector employees. It was not until on Thursday that he did the same for the nation\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18334915.rishi-sunak-set-aid-package-5m-self-employed-workers-help-survive-pandemic/\" title=\"\">5 million self-employed</a>. This is in part because to help these workers meant dealing with the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fissuredworkplace.net/\" title=\"\">fissuring</a>\u201d of the workplace, where people doing the same job in many sectors have increasingly different pay, benefits and privileges. While the complexity and precarious nature of the labour market has helped companies, especially those who can skilfully navigate lightly regulated employment rules, these fissures undermine the safety net which depends crucially on employment status.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-government-bailouts-steadying-unsteady-jobs\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-government-bailouts-steadying-unsteady-jobs", "date_published": "2020-03-26 19:37:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK-EU talks on post-Brexit relations 'in deep freeze'", "description": "<p>Brussels laments London\u2019s failure to table comprehensive legal text to work on</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Planned negotiating rounds on the UK\u2019s future relationship with the EU have been abandoned as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, with Boris Johnson\u2019s government still to table a comprehensive legal text for both sides to work on.</p><p>During a European commission briefing on Thursday, envoys for the EU capitals were told that holding negotiations via video-conferencing had so far proved impossible.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/covid-19-puts-post-brexit-relationship-talks-in-deep-freeze\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/covid-19-puts-post-brexit-relationship-talks-in-deep-freeze", "date_published": "2020-03-26 19:31:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "FA preparing for possibility top women's teams will fold because of coronavirus", "description": "<ul><li>Talks to be held about possible new Championship licences</li><li>Women\u2019s seasons below top two divisions voided</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a> | <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The Football Association is preparing for the possibility that teams in the Women\u2019s Super League and Women\u2019s Championship could fold under the financial pressures placed on them by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>The Guardian understands that when club representatives from the top two divisions hold a conference call with the FA on Friday they will discuss the possibility of inviting teams from lower down the pyramid to apply for Women\u2019s Championship licences should the leagues become imbalanced.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/fa-preparing-for-possibility-top-womens-teams-will-fold-because-of-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/26/fa-preparing-for-possibility-top-womens-teams-will-fold-because-of-coronavirus", "date_published": "2020-03-26 19:31:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus travel updates: which countries have restrictions and FCO warnings in place?", "description": "<p>Foreign Office advises UK nationals against all non-essential travel for 30 days.
