Academic writing is often highly complex, uses lengthy sentences and endless amounts of specialist terminology.\n\nIn today's video, which brings together both my What the Theory? series and Essay Tips series, I take a look at why this might be the case.\n\nDrawing on articles by Steven Pinker, Judith Butler and many other scholars, I dive into the debate over academic writing styles to ask whether academics are simply being self-indulgent when they sit down to write essays, academic papers, books and journal articles or whether there might be a good reason for their work not always being wholly accessible to a general audience.\n\nFollowing on from this, I then take a look at the politics of style to consider whether, sometimes, the use of complex and hard-to-understand language might be necessary to critique the society and culture around us.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities, as well as video essays and more, then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: @Tom_Nicholas\nInstagram: @TomNicholasWTF\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: [www.tomnicholas.com](http://www.tomnicholas.com/)\n\nMusic Credits\nRhodesia\u00a0by\u00a0Twin Musicom\u00a0is licensed under a\u00a0Creative Commons Attribution\u00a0license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist:\u00a0http://www.twinmusicom.org/\n\n#academicwriting #university #philosophy", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbwGr9GOtO0", "date_published": "2020-03-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
