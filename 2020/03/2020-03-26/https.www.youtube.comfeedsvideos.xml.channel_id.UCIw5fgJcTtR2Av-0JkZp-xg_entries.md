Here's a live looping jam of my track Furious Anger, sampled from Pulp Fiction.

Equipment used:
- Elektron Octatrack MkII
- Novation Circuit
- Korg Microkorg XL+
- Teenage Engineering OP-1
- iConnectAudio4+
- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups
- Fender Precision Bass
- myVolts mickXer

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.
The Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+ (ica4+), which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit, OP-1, Microkorg. MIDI start/play message goes to the Circuit only, and starts the drum kit, but since it's tied to a Thru machine Track 1 on the Octatrack that only trigs at a later section, you hear it come in later.
This jam was almost completely structured by the Arranger in the Octatrack, except for the outtro, which was a looping pattern until it was manually selected to play the end pattern. I kept this one simple without many fancy looping tricks, most of the loopers were triggered using one-shot recording trigs. The only time I manually started a loop was the guitar loop at the end.
