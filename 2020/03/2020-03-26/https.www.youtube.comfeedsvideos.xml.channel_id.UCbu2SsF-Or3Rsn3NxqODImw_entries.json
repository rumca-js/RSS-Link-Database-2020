Basically, New Horizons is a family friendly delight that we couldn't enjoy more. But what if you play like a jerk and try to wreak havoc and just be a general nuisance on the island?\n\nThat's exactly the good work that GameSpot's Rob Handerly and Jake Dekker did in a new GameSpot video. Check out our first installment of \"Vile Villager\" to see Handerly and Dekker rekindle the spirit of Dirty Arty to bring you what we can only describe as essential viewing.\n\nRob and Jake begin by creating a very unsettling character before building an island that they most lovingly named \"MeatHouse.\" It only gets more absurd from there, so be sure to watch the full video to see all of their hijinks in action. \n\nDon't forget to check out all of GameSpot's other Animal Crossing: New Horizons guides and features covering everything you need to know about the game. \n\n#TheVileVillager #AnimalCrossing #NewHorizons #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJ5D8lSMLw0", "date_published": "2020-03-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call Of Duty Warzone & Modern Warfare Updates: Everything You Need To Know In Under 3 Minutes", "description": "Activision is rolling out new Call of Duty content across the series this week, with fresh updates for Warzone, Modern Warfare, and Mobile.

Here's why you shouldn't time skip.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons has finally arrived on Nintendo Switch. Nintendo's charming life sim series has always had a very leisurely pace compared to other games, but even by these standards, New Horizons gets off to a slow start. You'll spend your first few days gradually transforming your deserted island into a bustling town, and this entails gathering lots of materials to build bridges, picking out plots of land for new residents, and setting up a museum and general store.\n\nGiven how long it takes to develop your island, you may be tempted to set your Switch clock forward and skip time to unlock things more quickly. We wouldn't recommend that, however. As Jake explains in the video above, time traveling may be an alluring way to get your town up and running, but you should resist the temptation and let the game unfold naturally.\n\nNew Horizons has received very positive reviews from critics. GameSpot's Kallie Plagge gave it an 8/10 in our Animal Crossing: New Horizons review-in-progress, writing, \"So far, I've played Animal Crossing: New Horizons for 80 hours over 17 days, and that anticipation hasn't yet gone away.
