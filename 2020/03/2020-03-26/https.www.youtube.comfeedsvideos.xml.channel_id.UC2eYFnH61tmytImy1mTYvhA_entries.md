How do you set wallpapers in Linux? I show not just how I set them, but easy features to add that pick random wallpapers, change wallpapers persistently, generate color schemes from wall papers and even view wallpapers in a gallery for picking. It's way easier than you think if you just use command line tools instead of a silly gui walled garden! 😉 You can do a lot with xwallpaper!

If you have ffmpeg and know how to use it, you don't need some enormous point and click video editor to do basic tasks. It can crop, resize, split, combine, interpolate, adjoin, readjust, stabilize, filter and everything else your videos. I've used ffmpeg exclusively for probably around the past two years of my YouTube channel.
