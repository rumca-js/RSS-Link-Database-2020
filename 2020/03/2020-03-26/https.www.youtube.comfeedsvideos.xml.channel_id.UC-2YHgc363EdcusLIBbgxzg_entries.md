David Quammen is the author of Spillover: Animal Infections and the Next Human Pandemic, which eerily predicted the kind of zoonotic virus outbreaks that we're seeing right now. In this interview, we talk about his experience tracking ebola in Africa in 2007, why bats make such great hosts for viruses, and why we'll be seeing more outbreaks like this in the future.
