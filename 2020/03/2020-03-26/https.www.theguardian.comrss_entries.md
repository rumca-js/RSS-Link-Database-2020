<p>The coronavirus crisis has exposed the holes in the UK’s welfare net. As unemployment rises, ministers will have to do more so that fewer people fall through them</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>We may be fighting the deadly spread of a tiny foe, but this is not a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/5945c61a-6dc7-11ea-89df-41bea055720b" title="">wartime economy</a>. In war, governments try to increase economic activity to produce weapons and are forced to tamp down inflation. Today governments deliberately want to lower economic activity to cut the risk of a virus transmission. Many Conservatives’ key belief in free-market societies is that they reward the industrious and punish the idle. Yet the mass joblessness, income shortfalls and business failures we hear about are not because of any human flaw, but because of a government-led shutdown and the fear coursing through the economy. The upshot is that GDP will fall. However, we must not let this situation spiral out of control. Letting a shutdown that lowers aggregate demand lead to unemployment that further cuts demand could put the economy into a tailspin. What is needed is for people and firms to maintain cashflow and help with bills, until some semblance of normality returns.</p><p>While businesses have been bailed out, there has been a slower move to put money in the pockets of people. Last week the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, said the government would pay 80% of the wages of the UK’s 28 million private sector employees. It was not until on Thursday that he did the same for the nation’s <a href="https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18334915.rishi-sunak-set-aid-package-5m-self-employed-workers-help-survive-pandemic/" title="">5 million self-employed</a>. This is in part because to help these workers meant dealing with the “<a href="https://www.fissuredworkplace.net/" title="">fissuring</a>” of the workplace, where people doing the same job in many sectors have increasingly different pay, benefits and privileges. While the complexity and precarious nature of the labour market has helped companies, especially those who can skilfully navigate lightly regulated employment rules, these fissures undermine the safety net which depends crucially on employment status.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/the-guardian-view-on-government-bailouts-steadying-unsteady-jobs">Continue reading...</a>

A representative of ASO contacted by the Guardian said the company had no comment to make.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/26/tour-de-france-could-be-staged-this-summer-without-any-spectators">Continue reading...</a>

This song cycle for soprano and ensemble, Grisey’s final work, first performed in 1999 just a few months after his sudden death at the age of 52, stands as one of the finest achievements of the last half-century. It’s an awfully prescient meditation on death and the process of dying, which might have signalled the beginning of a new, more openly lyrical phase in Grisey’s development, had he lived to explore it. Its mingling of loss and consolation is still very hard to separate from the memories of its premiere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/la-passione-review-grisey-barbara-hannigan">Continue reading...</a>

## Lucia Bosé obituary

<p>Italian actor who appeared the films of Antonioni, Buñuel and Fellini</p><p>The Italian actor Lucia Bosé, who has died aged 89, having contracted coronavirus, was much admired in two landmark films of the 1950s: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/aug/01/guardianobituaries.obituaries">Michelangelo Antonioni</a>’s first feature, Cronaca di un Amore (Story of a Love Affair, 1950), and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/02/guardianobituaries.filmnews">Juan Antonio Bardem</a>’s Muerte de un Ciclista (Death of a Cyclist, 1955). The latter changed Bosé’s life, as she met the bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguín when the film was shot in Spain. They married within two months and their relationship gained Bosé greater international attention than any of her films had. Although she gave up acting for several years, she still occasionally appeared in prestigious films, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/nov/01/federico-fellini-dies-film-italy">Federico Fellini</a>’s Satyricon (1969).</p><p>Lucia was born in Milan, to poor parents, Francesca Bosé and Domenico Borloni, and found employment as an errand girl in a lawyer’s office. Later, while working in a Milanese pastry shop, she was noticed by the director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/15/featuresreviews.guardianreview22">Luchino Visconti</a> who promised to help her get into films. In 1947 she won the Miss Italy beauty contest, beating Gina Lollobrigida.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/26/lucia-bose-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## 'They can cost £63k': how the hazmat suit came to represent disease, danger – and hope

<p>On the one hand faceless and frightening, on the other a symbol of heroic resistance to deadly viruses, here’s how the hazmat suit became a symbol of our times<br /></p><p>They tread slowly, gracelessly, at a plodding pace. With their aspirators they could be astronauts, of this earth but detached from it, sucking clean air through umbilical tubes. They comfort and alarm in equal measure, these slow-moving harbingers of sickness and death. Intellectually, you know they are there to help, to protect. But the hazmat suit creates a divide. There is the person who wears it and the person they need protecting from. You never want to be on the wrong side of a hazmat suit, because if you are, you know something’s gone horribly wrong.</p><p>As the coronavirus pandemic spreads around the world, images of medical personnel in hazmat suits have become commonplace in newspapers and news bulletins. But it Is not just medics who are donning protective wear. A fortnight ago, Naomi Campbell <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iqFRaCoyvw&amp;t=302s">posted a video</a> in which she explained her motivations for flying in a hazmat suit, accessorised with a Burberry cape. Last week, before the nationwide lockdown, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/coronavirus-campaigners-lock-down-downing-street-uk-government-europe-measures-a9404441.html">activists in hazmat suits protested outside Downing Street</a> about the government’s sluggish response to coronavirus. Personal protective equipment (PPE) in general has been high up the news agenda, as beleaguered NHS staff warn the government that an inadequate supply is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/22/nhs-staff-cannon-fodder-lack-of-coronavirus-protection">putting frontline health workers at risk</a>. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/hazmat-suit-disease-deadly-viruses-danger-symbol-heroic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the documentary Kill Chain, the weaknesses of America’s basic election infrastructure are laid bare</p><p>Even as much of America grinds to a halt, coronavirus has yet to derail the date of the 2020 election. Which introduces a perhaps underestimated terror, as explained in one of the more deceptively scary documentaries to drop in recent weeks: the vulnerable voting machine. That seemingly benign piece of equipment – the hardware of American democracy – is, as several experts explain in HBO’s Kill Chain: The Cyber War on America’s Elections, nothing more than an obsolete computer. And these machines’ vulnerabilities to hacking are “terrifying”, director Sarah Teale told the Guardian. America’s current election infrastructure is, as Kill Chain explains, a prescription for disaster – an outdated, willfully naive system no more prepared for attack than four years ago.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/19/after-truth-hbo-fake-news-pizzagate-documentary">After Truth: how ordinary people are 'radicalized' by fake news</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/kill-chain-hbo-election-hacking-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dress up to work from home, take up calligraphy, learn Mandarin … enough of this chin-up cheerleading</p><p>Well – it’s all going well so far, this “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/uk-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-what-you-can-and-cannot-do">staying in for ever</a>” thing. My anxiety flares up at different times and mostly takes the form of intense irritation at particular groups of people. But I don’t mind being angry, as that is the thing that stops me being depressed. So far I have managed to have a row with the foolish hippies in the local health food shop about the stupid sign in the window about the only doctors you need being Dr Happy and Dr Nutrition and some other new-age nonsense. I merely pointed out that we might need, you know … some actual doctors.</p><p>Special venom has been reserved for joggers ( I note they now all call themselves runners) who pound every public place full of mucus, assuming they have right of way, and never seeming to observe the two-metre rule.

## Haifaa Al-Mansour: 'Female leaders are crushed. Look at Hillary Clinton'

<p>The Saudi Arabian director directed her first film, Wadjda, hiding in the back of a van on the streets of Riyadh. Now her latest, The Perfect Candidate, is opening doors in Hollywood</p><p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2223783/">Haifaa Al-Mansour</a>’s latest film, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6971114/">The Perfect Candidate</a>, opens with a doctor in her 20s driving to work. In any other film you wouldn’t register the fact that she’s behind the wheel. But this woman, dressed in a black abaya and niqab, is in Saudi Arabia, which until 2018 banned women from driving. Al-Mansour added the scene as a punch-the-air moment for female audiences in Saudi Arabia, an invite to a collective whoop of victory. “I know that in the west this seems like common-sense stuff,” she says. “But I think they’ve really helped women to see themselves as an independent people.” She fixes me with an earnest look, to see if I get it. “For younger professional women, it’s huge, because it gives them control over their destiny.”</p><p>Al-Mansour is Saudi Arabia’s first female director. In 2011, she shot her debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/18/wadjda-review">Wadjda</a>, hiding in the back of a van. It would have been impossible for a woman to be seen openly on the street giving orders to men. So, she kept out of sight and used a walkie-talkie (“But I’m sure you could hear my voice all over Riyadh. ‘Do that!’ ‘Pull the camera back!’”) The film was gorgeous, a funny, big-hearted story about a gobby 10-year-old girl who would stop at nothing to get her hands on a bike. Al-Mansour shrugged off the death threats (“One of them told me they had a coffin ready for me”). Spend five minutes in her company and you are struck by her optimistic energy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/26/haifaa-al-mansour-female-leaders-are-crushed-look-at-hillary-clinton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 1970, Phil Ochs released Greatest Hits, an album titled with savage irony as his career fell apart. But 50 years on, it remains a powerful indictment of an America losing its way</p><p>As a kid in the 1950s, Phil Ochs cut class and spent afternoons at the local movie house. The Searchers and Rebel Without a Cause were two of his favourites. Always a dreamer, Ochs fantasised that one day he could be a stoic cowboy like John Wayne, a teenage rebel like James Dean, or a rockabilly sex symbol like Elvis Presley. He took his early love of Hollywood with him to New York, where he became one of the most celebrated folk singers in the world, culminating in an album that has just turned 50: Greatest Hits, titled with a savage, knowing irony.</p><p>Ochs came up in the Greenwich Village folk scene, rattling off songs at a pace that caused Bob Dylan – with whom he had a friendly rivalry – to complain “I just can’t keep up with Phil”. But Ochs couldn’t cross over like Dylan did. His sole hit song There But for Fortune, which reached No 50 in the US and the Top 10 in the UK, was performed by Joan Baez.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/26/phil-ochs-the-doomed-folk-singer-who-woke-up-from-the-american-dream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A former naughty kid is now the man keeping Britain’s schoolchildren fit in lockdown. His enthusiasm is irrepressible, and he’s using it in the service of some admirably big ambitions</p><p>It is not these extraordinary times that have made Joe Wicks. He was already huge, initially from Instagram cooking videos that lasted just 15 seconds. Rudimentary but engagingly zany, they attracted a substantial if hodgepodge fanbase from body-conscious zoomers to middle-aged mums. So when he brought out the cookbook <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/jan/09/lean-in-15s-joe-wicks-i-dont-understand-the-clean-eating-thing-ive-just-had-bangers-and-mash" title="">Lean in 15</a>, five years ago, his publisher said she would be delighted to sell 70,000 copies, which roughly amounted to one per Insta follower. Instead he sold 700,000, to become the second biggest seller in the cookery hall of fame, below Jamie Oliver.</p><p>This week, though, his live workouts on YouTube have put him in a different league. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/mar/24/why-35-million-people-want-joe-wicks-to-be-their-pe-teacher" title="">Every morning at 9am, he is running a “PE lesson”</a>: an exercise class for kids that you can do in your living room. It sounds like a simple idea, but now every child in the country (and their mum) is talking about it, his name forming a compound noun with his chosen title: “Yes, I’ve done my PE homework, I’ve done JoeWicksBodyCoach.” Kids love the kangaroo hops and parents love the fact it gets their children burning off excess energy when they are trapped inside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/26/joe-wicks-interview-my-hearthrob-days-are-over">Continue reading...</a>

Everyone is surely right about that. But what follows in politics, economics and social behaviour from that recognition? There is no agreement there. There are resemblances with wartime, of course, but Britain never went into almost total lockdown in wartime. There are echoes of past pestilences too, but these afflictions did not bring normal life to such a totalising standstill.</p><p>And these are only early days in a long process. Politicians are no better than anyone else at adjusting to radical change.
