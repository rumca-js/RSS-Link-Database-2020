While we've already seen 12 minutes of official gameplay, we recently learned more about what the DLC includes.\n\nLove, Guns, & Tentacles focuses on the wedding of Sir Hammerlock and Wainwright Jakobs. The ceremony is held on Xylourgos, where you'll also encounter Borderlands 2's Mechromancer Gaige, who just so happens to be the wedding planner. You can battle rock slugs, wolvens, and cultists alongside her on the new ice planet.\n\nThe DLC launches alongside an update for all Borderlands players, which increases the level cap from 53 to 57. The extra skill point included in that bump means you'll be able to equip a second capstone skill. Learn all about it in the video above.\n\n#Borderlands3 #GunsLoveAndTentacles #EverythingYouNeedToKnow #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USSDBT2ge8U", "date_published": "2020-03-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Doom Eternal Review", "description": "Doom Eternal intensifies the battles with Hell's hordes by requiring you to constantly calculate the best ways to rip, tear, and stay alive.\n\n#DOOMEternal #GameSpotReview", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bA3nM_v2eU", "date_published": "2020-03-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Let's Play Bleeding Edge", "description": "With Ninja Theory's Bleeding Edge now available for Xbox One and PC through Xbox Game Pass, Jean-Luc and Ben decide to jump into the MOBA-like 4v4 brawler to cause a little chaos.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiLGUOFs3IU", "date_published": "2020-03-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "37 Things We'll Never Forget About The Xbox One", "description": "The Xbox One has had a tumultuous journey, from a rocky start to a resurgent turn around.

Here's everything you need to know about the free update--and look for Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher too.\n\nGhost Recon Breakpoint is getting a new Immersive mode in its next update. Immersive mode limits your health regeneration, resources, and HUD, and eliminates the tiered loot system. You'll customize the same on or two primary firearms throughout your journey, unless you loot new weapons from fallen enemies.\n\nImmersive mode is one of three ways to play through the game via the Ghost Experience, Ubisoft's official title for the new update. Another way to play is Regular mode, which is the Breakpoint you're used to. Finally, Custom mode lets you tweak a series of rules including injury risk from enemy bullets, number of bandages you can carry, and availability of Maria's Shop. These are detailed in the video above.\n\nThe Ghost Experience update is planned for a March 24 release date on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. That's the same day Splinter Cell crosses over with the franchise again.\n\n#GhostReconBreakpoint #ImmersiveMode #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZOTwnC31LE", "date_published": "2020-03-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Half-Life: Alyx - Things I Wish I Knew Before Playing", "description": "Here's how to dodge Headcrabs, kill Combine with Gravity Gloves, solve puzzles, and survive in Half-Life: Alyx.\n\nHalf-Life: Alyx is a tremendous experience that amplifies the best qualities of the series by leveraging the potential of VR in many ways.
