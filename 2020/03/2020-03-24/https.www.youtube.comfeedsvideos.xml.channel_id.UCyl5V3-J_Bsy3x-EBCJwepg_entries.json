Any of them. \r\n\r\n   Story 2 -  Trump Says, 'I Don't Want Any Americans To Die', NYT Quotes As 'I... Want... Americans To Die'\r\n\r\n   The latest example of fake news. The New York Times changes its headline  three times to make the Democrats look better in the relief bill obstruction. Went from \u201cDemocrats Block\u2026\u201d to \u201cPartisan Divide\u2026\u201d\r\n\r\n   Trump press conferences where reporters take him out of context to make the virus response super partisan and political and try to paint him in the worst light. \u201cThe virus is a hoax\u201d \u201cTrump is attacking the press.\u201d \u201cTrump didn\u2019t plan ahead or order supplies in time.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s response is delayed\u201d \u201cTrump disbanded the pandemic response team\u201d \u201cTrump cut funding to the CDC\u201d, etc... Trump tweeted out this fact check.\r\n\r\n    WaPo reporter apologized and deleted the tweet which made it sound like Trump was calling the virus a \u201choax.\u201d\r\n\r\n   Trump was saying two medicines taken together might prove to be of help for those suffering from the virus, but they\u2019re still looking into it.

A couple drank aquarium tank cleaner and reporters tried to blame Trump.\r\n\r\n    Become a paid subscriber at https://babylonbee.com/plans", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jCrTAE0I80", "date_published": "2020-03-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
