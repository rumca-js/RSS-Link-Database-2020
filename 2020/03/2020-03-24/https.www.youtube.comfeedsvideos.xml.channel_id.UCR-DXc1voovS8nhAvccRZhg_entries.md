Jeff Geerling (geerlingguy) introduces Ansible in the first episode of a new live-streaming series "Ansible 101 with Jeff Geerling."

Jeff walks through installing Ansible, running tasks on a remote AWS EC2 instance using Ansible ad-hoc tasks, integrating Ansible with Vagrant to build local Virtual Machines (VMs), and then teaches you how to write your first Ansible playbook!

This video follows material from chapters 1 and 2 in the bestselling Ansible book, Ansible for DevOps.

In this eight livestream, we manually migrated the Blog view (which included a Blog landing page, a blog.xml RSS feed, and a 'Recent Blog Posts' block) from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8. Then we worked on styling and theming the Blog landing page, incorporating a theme hook suggestion to add a 'visually-hidden' class to the Blog landing page's title so it would not display but would still be present for those using screen readers.
