The second Borderlands 3 expansion is Love, Guns, & Tentacles, and it comes to PS4, Xbox One, and PC on March 26. While we've already seen 12 minutes of official gameplay, we recently learned more about what the DLC includes.

Love, Guns, & Tentacles focuses on the wedding of Sir Hammerlock and Wainwright Jakobs. The ceremony is held on Xylourgos, where you'll also encounter Borderlands 2's Mechromancer Gaige, who just so happens to be the wedding planner. You can battle rock slugs, wolvens, and cultists alongside her on the new ice planet.

The DLC launches alongside an update for all Borderlands players, which increases the level cap from 53 to 57. The extra skill point included in that bump means you'll be able to equip a second capstone skill. Learn all about it in the video above.

The Xbox One has had a tumultuous journey, from a rocky start to a resurgent turn around. We go over its many ups and down over the last 7 years.

In the video above we go over the history from its rocky release in 2013 to 2020. The Xbox One went over several iterations from the original Xbox One, to the slim Xbox One S, to the powerful Xbox One X. Figureheads such as Don Mattrick and Phil Spencer have influenced the Xbox Oneâ€™ history for better and for worse. Many games were created and canceled.

Ghost Recon Breakpoint is adding Immersive mode, challenging you to play with limited resources and no weapon leveling. Here's everything you need to know about the free update--and look for Splinter Cell's Sam Fisher too.

Ghost Recon Breakpoint is getting a new Immersive mode in its next update. Immersive mode limits your health regeneration, resources, and HUD, and eliminates the tiered loot system. You'll customize the same on or two primary firearms throughout your journey, unless you loot new weapons from fallen enemies.

Immersive mode is one of three ways to play through the game via the Ghost Experience, Ubisoft's official title for the new update. Another way to play is Regular mode, which is the Breakpoint you're used to. Finally, Custom mode lets you tweak a series of rules including injury risk from enemy bullets, number of bandages you can carry, and availability of Maria's Shop. These are detailed in the video above.

The Ghost Experience update is planned for a March 24 release date on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. That's the same day Splinter Cell crosses over with the franchise again.

Here's how to dodge Headcrabs, kill Combine with Gravity Gloves, solve puzzles, and survive in Half-Life: Alyx.

Half-Life: Alyx is a tremendous experience that amplifies the best qualities of the series by leveraging the potential of VR in many ways. The game nails so much of what makes the series special, too. But if you're not familiar with the ins-and-outs of VR or the way Half-Life typically does things, we have you covered with our essential tips to guide you on the right path before playing Half-Life: Alyx.

In the video above, we point out the best route to spend your important resource called Resin, which is used to upgrade your weapons. We also give some pointers on how to deal with headcrab zombies and barnacles, and how to generally find solutions to puzzles if you find yourself lost. While you'll have plenty of movement options for VR, we have a suggestion that could make combat more manageable if you're able to do so.

We have this game covered from all angles, so be sure to read up on all our stories like how Half-Life: Alyx could've been more of a horror game, the ideas behind the accessibility options, or all the Half-Life Easter eggs we've found so far. And for our final word on the game, check out our Half-Life: Alyx review.
