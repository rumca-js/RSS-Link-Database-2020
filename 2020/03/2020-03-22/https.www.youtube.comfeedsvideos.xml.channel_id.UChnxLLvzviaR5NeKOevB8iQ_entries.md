The RMR Circuit Pack (Volume 2) is now available. Get it here: https://gum.co/iVYts

This pack is now Circuit Tracks compatible! Check your purchase on Gumroad to get a new download. Also, I've made a mega pack for Circuit Tracks that includes packs 1 and 2 plus new sample content! Get that here: https://redmeansrecording.gumroad.com/l/rmr_ctracks_01

This is a preset pack for the Novation Circuit, a 2-synth, 4-drum groovebox.
This pack has 48 presets, 64 samples, and 19 demo sessions.
It also includes a semi-mapped INIT patch called “_INIT_Mapped_singlepatch.syx” which has the 8 macros mapped to useful things. You can use this to start your own sounds without having to map to some of the most common controls.
The download also includes performances, as audio, of the demo sessions.

UPDATE: While the Covid crisis isn't over, I recently lost my job and now rely on the income from packs like these. I've bumped the pack up to its intended 5$ price. Sorry for having to do that, but times are tough.
