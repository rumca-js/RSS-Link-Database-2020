You'll recognize quite a few of your guns in Eternal from Doom 2016, but in the sequel, they often hit harder, look cooler, and sound better. Check out the video above to see a comparison of each of the returning weapons in Doom Eternal and how they've been tweaked since your last venture to Hell.\n\nOne of the biggest changes in Doom Eternal is the way its weapons give you more options in combat. While you'll have a lot of the same guns and mods as in Doom 2016, you'll often find those weapons have new uses in Eternal. Many demons now have weak points that you can pick off if you have the right weapon, knocking off their guns or limbs and reducing their monstrous lethality. While your guns give you a lot of different ways of ripping and tearing through the legions of Hell, you'll often need to think about the best gun to take out an enemy quickly if you want to stay alive.\n\nUnderstanding the intricacies of Doom Eternal's weapons is an essential part of the experience. As GameSpot's Phil Hornshaw put it in his Doom Eternal review in progress, \"Though it can take a bit to get the hang of it, the intricacies of Doom Eternal's combat, combined with its enhanced mobility and option-heavy level design, create a ton of white-knuckle moments that elevate everything that made Doom 2016 work so well.\"\n\n#DOOMEternal #DOOM2016 #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAdHYSXe-Zo", "date_published": "2020-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Doom Eternal Easter Eggs And References", "description": "From copies of Quake 3 on the Doom Slayer's shelf and classic weapons making a comeback, to finding Daisy the Rabbit, these are Doom Eternal's best Easter Eggs.\n\nDoom has always been full of bizarre secrets, hidden gems and easter eggs and Doom Eternal may have more than all the rest put together.\n\nWe spent some time diving into the dark corners of the game to see what strange things we could find.\n\nFrom giant green fish and skateboards, to toy demons and the Doom Slayer\u2019s pet rabbit Daisy, we do our best to find every Easter Egg in Doom Eternal. \n\nDoom Eternal is stuffed with hilarious Easter eggs and callbacks to not only past Doom games, but other all of id Software's games. There's so much chances are you won't catch them all, which is why we've compiled as many as we could possibly find, just for you!\n\n#DOOMEternal #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CAsHJbALZk", "date_published": "2020-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
