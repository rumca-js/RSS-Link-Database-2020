That we are doing our best to adjust to our bleak new realities? In the age of coronavirus, realities change by the hour. The friends and family who rushed to embrace us after we lost our beautiful boys now keep a responsible distance, especially from my mother, who is 86. The government advises over-70s to stay home and shun visitors. My mother, alone for the first time in her life, oppressed by the weight of \u201csadmin\u201d and new to the technologies that offer virtual connections, could scarcely be more isolated in her self-isolation.
