We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They\u2019re recorded by the artists in their home. It\u2019s the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nWatch Harry Styles play \"Cherry\", \"Watermelon Sugar\", \"To Be So Lonely\" and \"Adore You\" at the Tiny Desk.\n\nDid you know you can watch new Tiny Desk concerts on npr.org ONE WEEK before they go up on YouTube?

But when you watch his set from behind Bob Boilen's desk, you'd never suspect any discomfort.\n\nBacked by his touring band, Styles performed several songs from his latest solo album, Fine Line. Between tracks, he talked about the process of writing these songs: From the day off in Nashville that led to \"Watermelon Sugar,\" to the feeling of lovesickness he tried to capture in \"Adore You.\" The camaraderie between the band was clear; and Styles was in on the joy, twirling in his seat between verses.\n\nStyles might not necessarily be the first name that comes to mind when you think of public radio's only working, desk-music-discovery platform. After all, he's got a wildly devoted fanbase that's followed his every move since his One Direction days. In fact, before soundcheck had even started, a crowd of fans had begun to gather outside NPR HQ. They rightly suspected he would be playing a Tiny Desk concert after word got out that the former One Directioner was spotted in D.C. with no tour date on his public schedule.\n\nBut beyond the headlines, Styles has proven to be an artist who takes his songcraft and aesthetic seriously, interested in subverting expectations of what a pop star can and should sound like in 2020. That sense of unpretentious creativity is exactly what he brought to his Tiny Desk performance \u2013 and it definitely earned him some new adoring public radio fans in the process.\n\n\"I have to come into NPR more often,\" Styles said after he and his band played their first song. \"It's nice here.\"\n\nWe \u2014 and our massive crowd of colleagues \u2014 couldn't agree more.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cherry\"\n\"Watermelon Sugar\"\n\"To Be So Lonely\"\n\"Adore You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nHarry Styles: vocals, guitar; Sarah Jones: drums, vocals; Mitch Rowland: guitar; Adam Prendergast: bass, vocals; Ny Oh: guitar, vocals; Charlotte Clark: piano, Wurlitzer, guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Robin Hilton, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Kara Frame, CJ Riculan, Melany Rochester, Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIIuzB11dsA", "date_published": "2020-03-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US"}]
