All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.\nThe Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+, which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit and Microkorg. This time I didn't use the OP-1 or the Minilogue for the jam - kept it simple.\nI used the Octatrack Arranger for this one, manually moving the arrangement to the next step from the percussion looping part, as I didn't know how long I wanted to be looping those instruments. The rest were Arranger sequenced, and the final part was an infinite looping that I faded out.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tkX2d_xr7Kk", "date_published": "2020-03-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
