One of the great American country singers who had hits with The Gambler, Lucille and Islands in the Stream<p>Kenny Rogers, who has died aged 81, was a prolific hit-maker from the late 1960s into the 80s, and with songs such as Lucille, The Gambler and Coward of the County helped to create a bestselling crossover of pop and country material. “I did songs that were not country but were more pop,” he said in 2016. “If the country audience doesn’t buy it, they’ll kick it out. And if they do, then it becomes country music.”</p><p>Rogers’s knack for finding a popular song – he was modest about his own writing skills and preferred to pick songs from other writers – was unerring, bringing him huge hits with <a href="https://www.songhall.org/profile/don_schlitz" title="">Don Schlitz</a>’s The Gambler (1978), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI2CvL6UYvE" title="">Lionel Richie’s Lady (1980)</a>, and, with Dolly Parton, the Bee Gees’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05TGYk5gTLM" title="">Islands in the Stream (1983)</a> among many others. Though his record sales waned in the late 80s, he bounced back in his last years with three successful albums, The Love of God (2011), You Can’t Make Old Friends (2013) and Once Again It’s Christmas (2015). Altogether he recorded 65 albums and sold more than 165m records.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/22/kenny-rogers-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Universal Music Latino)</p><p>Since Colombian reggaeton sensation J Balvin’s global breakthrough with 2017 banger <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnJ6LuUFpMo" title="">Mi Gente</a>, his stock has risen thanks in part to a slew of well-chosen collaborations that have ridden the wave of streaming culture’s democratisation. From Beyoncé appearing on a Mi Gente remix, to global smashes with the likes of Cardi B (I Like It) and fellow Latin sensation Rosalía (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7bfOZek9t4" title="">Con Altura</a>), Balvin has expertly curated his superstar status by bringing other people into his world without compromise (he still sings and raps in Spanish).</p><p>Perhaps keen to reiterate how in control he is, his sixth album, <em>Colores</em> (each song is named after a shade), limits outside guests to just one, with Nigerian Afrobeats star Mr Eazi bringing a swooning softness to the dancefloor-ready Arcoíris. Elsewhere it’s Balvin’s show, be it utilising a Drake-esque croon on the excellent R&amp;B slow jam-esque Rojo, or eerily stalking the drip-feed beat that underpins bass-rattling highlight, Negro.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/22/j-balvin-colores-review-reggaeton-hooks-ideas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We are not wired to tolerate uncertainty – and these are the most uncertain of times. But while increased anxiety is only natural, we can all adopt strategies to control it</p><p>Just over a week ago, our world looked very different from how it does today. The shift has been so rapid and frightening, it feels as if the ground beneath us has given way. It is disorienting, as if normal life is just over there, out of reach. I have been through two major bereavements, close together, and this has the same unanchored feeling of grief.</p><p>The human brain is not wired to tolerate uncertainty, but it is wired to be alert to any threat. So, if you are feeling pandemic panic, it is only natural. Blame your brain.

## Shakespeare in lockdown: did he write King Lear in plague quarantine?

<p>Pestilence was rife in the Bard’s time, closing theatres and ravaging life. Did he write his bleak, desperate drama while self-isolating? We sift the evidence </p><p>While those of us stuck in self-isolation or working from home <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/quarantine?lang=en">watch </a><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/quarantine?lang=en">TikTok videos</a> and refresh liveblogs, a meme has been going around that claims Shakespeare <a href="https://mashable.com/article/shakespeake-coronavirus-king-lear-plague-memes/?europe=true">made use of being quarantined during the plague to write King Lear</a>. The Bard supposedly took advantage of the Globe’s lengthy closure to get on top of his writing in-tray – coming up with Macbeth and Antony and Cleopatra to boot. If you weren’t panicky enough about how little you’ve achieved recently, this is surely a way to feel worse. Why aren’t you finally dusting off that novel or screenplay you’ve been itching to write? It’s what the Bard would do, surely.</p><p>Yet, is it actually true, the bit about Shakespeare? Well, maybe. Certainly it’s fair to say that, like all Elizabethans, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/broadway-shutdown-could-be-good-theater-coronavirus/607993/">the playwright’s career was affected by the </a><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/broadway-shutdown-could-be-good-theater-coronavirus/607993/">bubonic plague</a> in ways that are all but impossible to conceive now, even in the midst of Covid-19. As an infant, he was lucky to survive the disease: Stratford-upon-Avon was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4Nc7vGnsc0T4YHCRwDMtCG5/transcript-shakespeares-restless-world-programme-17">ravaged by a huge outbreak in the summer of 1564</a>, a few months after he was born, and up to a quarter of the town’s population died. Growing up, Shakespeare would have heard endless stories about this apocalyptic event and kneeled in church in solemn remembrance of townsfolk who were lost. His father, John, was closely involved in relief efforts and attended a meeting to help Stratford’s poorest. It was held outdoors because of the risk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/22/shakespeare-in-lockdown-did-he-write-king-lear-in-plague-quarantine">Continue reading...</a>

The palette of sounds she draws from on the long-awaited, and largely self-incubated, follow-up is familiar – her pitchshifted vocals lend her an androgyny at times, as on First, in which she gives the illusion of duetting with herself – while the ability to conjure emotionally potent songs from the most minimal of raw materials nods to James Blake.</p><p>What is less familiar are her more outward-facing lyrics. Whereas her debut was all about the personal, <em>Through Water</em> is more explicitly political, no more so than on the opening title track, which addresses the climate crisis via quotes made from a speech by her water engineer father. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlf2M56Qbcc" title="">The standout recent single Womxn</a>, meanwhile, tackles female self-confidence via a gloriously uplifting hook. “I look, I breathe, I feel like a woman”.

## Old tech’s new wave, the gadgets of yesteryear making a comeback

<p>Once seen as cutting edge, many of yesterday’s gadgets are – surprisingly – still in use or are making a comeback. Richard Godwin goes back to the future</p><p>Imagine a start-up entrepreneur pitching the traditional milk round to a venture capitalist. “So we’re offering a local, sustainable, subscription-based protein delivery system. And get this: it’s all going to be powered by electric vehicles…” Back in the 1970s, 94% of British households bought their milk this way, but by the 2000s, for the vast majority, it was part of the weekly supermarket shop. It wasn’t technology that killed the centuries-old tradition so much as economic forces: deregulation of the dairy industry and supermarkets pushing plastic bottles. However, milk rounds still account for 3% of milk sales and they are growing in popularity. The revival is mostly down to the “<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/25/plastics-revolution-marine-life" title="">Blue Planet</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/25/plastics-revolution-marine-life" title=""> effect</a>” – glass is much more environmentally friendly than plastic. A typical glass milk bottle is reused 25 times. Come to think of it, why aren’t we reusing Coke bottles, too?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/mar/22/old-techs-new-wave-or-why-we-still-love-faxes-pagers-and-cassettes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What drove a gang of football-loving British teenagers to fight in Syria? In his powerful new book, No Return, award-winning journalist Mark Townsend pieces together their tragic story<br /></p><p>Much has been written about Britons who fought in Syria, but little truly explains who these characters were, what made them tick. Or what actually happened when they disappeared into the byzantine politics of its brutal war. <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/no-return-9781783351817.html">No Return</a></em> tracks five teenage friends from Brighton who stepped into its chaos. All were killed except one. The survivor, Amer Deghayes, is the longest-serving Briton in Syria since the fighting began and offers a unique account of a ceaseless, shifting conflict.</p><p>Equally crucial are those he left behind. I learned that more than 30 Brightonians – the largest identified group of potential jihadists in western Europe – had discussed plans to join him. All were between 13 and 18 years of age, some were girls, most were white, working-class Islamic converts from the forgotten estates of east Brighton.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/22/the-brighton-jihadists-bullied-brothers-who-went-into-battle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Chinese artist answers questions from Observer readers and art world luminaries on creativity and protest, Chinese politics – and why he never cooks the same dish twice</p><p>Ai Weiwei’s studio can be found behind unmarked, black metal doors in a grand square in the old east Berlin. You immediately descend two flights of very steep stone stairs before emerging, blinking for light, into a vast, brick-lined cavern that has the proportions of a church. The temperature drops a few degrees. The space was originally, back in the mid-19th century, the cooling warehouses for the Bavarian brewer Joseph Pfeffer. But, since Ai fled China five years ago, this has been his main place of work – and, given that the 62-year-old artist and activist is almost always working, more besides.</p><p>“When I’m here, it’s like my home,” says Ai, who wears a blue hoodie and comfortable shoes, his beard less unruly than it appears in photographs. “<em>Like</em> my home,” he clarifies. “I’ve never had a home. In China, my studio was often destroyed. So for me, it’s a shelter – a shelter not so different from refugees in the camps that gradually build up. I can leave, of course, but since 2015, I have stayed here, never had a holiday or weekends. I’m working all the time.” His face crinkles into a smile: “I love work.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/22/ai-weiwei-an-artist-must-be-an-activist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The shutdown of cultural life has raised urgent debate about how to protect one of Britain’s most high-profile industries<br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Images of empty museums, cinemas, concert halls and galleries across the country are quickly becoming emblems of our changing life. And this weekend there is fresh speculation that the world’s biggest arts festival in Edinburgh will not take place this August.</p><p>The end of live performance and public cultural activity is one of the most comprehensive of the myriad shocks to the British economy, as well as to a sense of normality. Theatre doors were closed by a puritanical English regime in 1642, but this total shutdown covers every form of shared entertainment and built heritage. And what now worries the country’s arts institutions is how this world-beating resource can be protected during lockdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/22/covid-19-forces-arts-virtual-venues-online-audiences-cultutal-life-shutdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Poverty and insecure pay existed before Covid-19.

So it is with Covid-19. On the one hand there is the selfishness of hoarding, on the other the selflessness of <a href="https://covidmutualaid.org/local-groups/" title="">mutual aid groups</a>. On the one hand, there is Britannia Hotels, which has not just sacked staff but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/scottish-hotel-admin-error-sacking-staff-covid-19" title="">evicted them</a> from their accommodation (a stance it now appears to have reversed under public pressure), on the other the footballer-turned-hotel-owner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-gary-neville-says-nhs-staff-will-stay-at-his-hotels-for-free-video" title="">Gary Neville</a>, who has promised to pay wages to all employees through the pandemic while also providing accommodation free of charge to NHS staff. On the one hand, there are medics and paramedics working heroically with inadequate protective equipment, on the other the Home Office using the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/dec/28/scrap-625-pound-surcharge-for-nhs-ovserseas-staff" title="">health surcharge</a>” to extort money from foreign doctors for the right to make use of the same health service they are helping to sustain.</p><p>In a crisis, too, issues that policymakers have long ignored suddenly become urgent. The pandemic has laid bare the insecurity of work, the cruelty of welfare policy, the hypocrisy of a system in which every time a crisis hits we are told that “we’re all in it together” but in which, before and after the crisis, the needs of the poorest and most vulnerable are largely ignored.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-exposes-society-fragility-find-solutions-that-will-endure">Continue reading...</a>

Ideological beliefs long worshipped in the churches of the right are being sacrificed in the fierce urgency of the now<p>The coronavirus doesn’t respect national borders, political ideologies or conventional thinking. As governments scramble to try to contain the pandemic and mitigate the fallout on economies and societies, the previously unthinkable is suddenly transformed into the essential. Policy ideas that were decried as madness yesterday are being redefined as the only sane response to this emergency. Positions once held to be immutable are being tossed into a great bonfire of discarded orthodoxies.</p><p>This is an especially bracing challenge for politicians of the right, they who have been animated for decades by the belief that the only good government is a small one and that there is no problem to which the market cannot supply the answer. A philosophy rooted in the conviction that individualism and competition are the wellsprings of healthy and productive societies is found wanting when confronted by a crisis that can only be endured and resolved by rediscovering the virtues of collectivism and solidarity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-crisis-ignites-bonfire-of-conservative-orthodoxies">Continue reading...</a>

## Cricket has lost the role it had in 1939 but it's still far more than a game | Kevin Mitchell

<p>For those of us waiting for old certainties to waft again on the summer breeze, there is almost certain disappointment. So we must rely on sporting nostalgia</p><p>Sport means nothing if it is not about passion and connection and nowhere is that more sharply defined than in football, as we have witnessed since coronavirus ripped it from our lives in recent weeks and days. Once, though, it was cricket, the summer game, deeper in history, richer in symbolism, that held the national sentiment in its gentle palm.</p><p>As Derek Birley relates in his excellent A Social History of English Cricket, when Sir Gordon Home wrote in the September 1939 issue of The Cricketer, he went straight for a contemporary metaphor. “England has now begun the grim Test match against Germany,” he said. “We do not wish merely to win the Ashes of civilisation. We want to win a lasting peace with honour and prosperity of all.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/mar/22/cricket-has-lost-the-role-it-had-in-1939-but-its-still-far-more-than-a-game">Continue reading...</a>

## Maggie O’Farrell: ‘Having to bury a child must be unlike anything else’

<p>Shakespeare’s only son, Hamnet, who died aged 11, is the inspiration for Maggie O’Farrell’s remarkable new novel. She talks about the link between his loss and the bard’s most famous work</p><p>When the novelist Maggie O’Farrell was 16, she was invited to a fancy-dress party and knew at once who to be. She put on a black shirt, with a ruffled paper collar, an inky cloak made out of a skirt, her Doc Martens and cheeky shorts over black leggings. To complete her ensemble, she borrowed a skull from her school’s biology lab. She had become obsessed with Hamlet: “He had got under my skin. I felt he was part of my DNA.” And while there is no mystery about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jun/25/hamlet-andrew-scott-harold-pinter-theatre-west-end-transfer-review-robert-icke" title="">Hamlet</a>’s glamorous turbulence appealing to an adolescent, O’Farrell’s feeling was to be rekindled, as an adult, by her discovery of the play’s connection with Shakespeare’s son, Hamnet. There was, she was sure, a novel in it. Over the years, she repeatedly tried to write that novel and almost gave up. Yet it was a story that refused to abandon her.</p><p>And now, here it is: <em><a href="https://www.maggieofarrell.com/titles/maggie-ofarrell/hamnet/9781472223791/" title="">Hamnet</a> </em>– the novel of her career. And that is saying something because O’Farrell is the author of eight accomplished and hugely popular books. She won the Costa novel award, in 2010, for <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/apr/25/hand-that-first-held-mine" title="">The Hand That First Held Mine</a></em>, and shortlisted for both <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/03/instructions-heatwave-maggie-ofarrell-review" title="">Instructions for a Heatwave</a></em> (2013) and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/27/this-must-be-the-place-by-maggie-ofarrell-review" title="">This Must Be the Place</a></em> (2016). Her wildcard memoir, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/20/maggie-ofarrell-i-am-seventeen-brushes-with-death-review" title="">I am, I am, I am: Seventeen Brushes With Death</a></em> (2017), about living close to the edge, was a bestseller. But <em>Hamnet</em> is a novel apart. And what distinguishes it from O’Farrell’s earlier work is that while it shares the page-turning verve of its predecessors, it pulls off what younger writers (she is now 47) seldom achieve: the power of letting a story appear to tell itself. It reads like a fairytale rooted in heartbreaking reality – there is no magic with which to save a child.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/22/maggie-ofarrell-novel-hamnet-interview-the-agony-of-burying-your-child">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Taking time out of the office to have a baby makes you think hard about your work and life</p><p>Why does it feel like a bigger deal preparing for maternity leave than it does for maternity itself? I look back at first-time me, springing out of the office on maternity leave, young and jowl-less, glowing with naivety and vitamin supplements, and I feel a melancholy affection for that sweet little girl. How little I knew. How simple that brain. This time, no. This time, the prospect of lockdown with a newborn and a five-year-old looming, I am an angry barrel rolling slowly from the building, sloshing with anxiety and ill will.</p><p>By the time you read this, I will be gone. I will have ceased to exist in my former identity, a working woman with deadlines and people to chat to by the teapoint and a morning commute. A person of whom more is expected than simply keeping a baby warm and quiet. Not <em>much</em> more, sure – but certainly things like getting to the office on time, performing a certain degree of critical thinking, conversational tact, computer skills, tuna sandwich and, if there’s time, wit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/22/will-my-second-maternity-leave-make-me-invisible-eva-wiseman">Continue reading...</a>

The friends and family who rushed to embrace us after we lost our beautiful boys now keep a responsible distance, especially from my mother, who is 86.

My mother, alone for the first time in her life, oppressed by the weight of “sadmin” and new to the technologies that offer virtual connections, could scarcely be more isolated in her self-isolation.

It’s why he has been a consultant to the World Health Organization, special adviser to four House of Commons select committee inquiries and a food policy adviser to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. So when he says in his new book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/feeding-britain-9780241442227.html" title="">Feeding Britain</a></em>, that, “although not officially at war, the UK is, de facto, facing a wartime scale of food challenge”, it’s worth paying attention. We are, he says, in serious trouble.</p><p>Lang, who established the pioneering <a href="https://www.city.ac.uk/about/schools/health-sciences/research/centre-for-food-policy" title="">Centre for Food Policy</a> at City University in 1994, makes no apologies for the bluntness of the statement. “I did not write that lightly,” he says, when we meet in central London. “I sat in my study, reviewing all the data. Things have just got worse.” Even so, he recognises how it looks. Panic buying aside, our supermarket shelves are usually full. We have access to a greater range of ingredients at better prices than at any time in human history. The conversation around how and what we eat often feels like it sits front and centre of the culture. “I like my food,” he says. “More joy around food has come into our lives.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/tim-lang-interview-professor-of-food-policy-city-university-supply-chain-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

Indigenous species do not grow fast enough, so imports will have to be planted in their millions to offset emissions, expert warns<p>Last century the Forestry Commission sparked anger with a mass planting of conifer trees designed to provide a national reserve of timber because the shortages of the first world war had highlighted a national need.</p><p>Now a leading expert is calling for similar action again, arguing that if the UK is serious about offsetting its carbon dioxide emissions it must plant tens of millions of trees from imported species on open land.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/22/conifer-oak-britain-forest-change-to-meet-climate-targets">Continue reading...</a>

Ville Lenkkeri’s photograph captures his sorrow at having to cut down a beloved tree from his childhood<p>Ville Lenkkeri took this photograph in 2013. The great birch tree, which stood behind his family’s summerhouse in Finland, had been a fixture in his life since childhood. When he was away from the house, he had a sense that it would watch over the place in his absence. And when he saw it once again he was reminded of some “magical and eternal strength”. The photo was taken on the day that Lenkkeri had to chop the tree down.</p><p>He had noticed that it had started to wither and rot from within two years earlier, but had resisted admitting that “its eternity was about to come to an end”. That summer, however, he decided that “felling the giant was a more honourable way to let it go”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/22/big-picture-special-branch-finland-ville-lenkkeri">Continue reading...</a>

Reading the menu makes me feel like one of those parents standing in the wings during the auditions for <em>Britain’s Got Talent</em>, watching my kids, Ant and Dec’s hands lightly on my shoulders for moral support. I am desperate for the kitchen to succeed. I want to hug them all to my bosom and tell them everything will be OK.

He hadn’t anticipated that the prime minister would encourage people to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/pm-tells-britons-to-avoid-non-essential-contact-with-others" title="">stay away from bars, clubs and restaurants</a>. “I had a panic attack,” Hung says. “It was the way it was done. It was announced with no clarity or backup. That wasn’t leadership.”</p><p>Immediately chefs and restaurateurs took to social media to complain that they’d been left hanging: they hadn’t been told to close but because of the coronavirus, their customers had been told to stay away. They understood the need to fight the virus and save lives, they said. But surely there had to be something in the way of support? In the days that followed, restaurant after restaurant announced it was closing its doors for the foreseeable future.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/chefs-and-restaurateurs-fear-they-may-go-under-after-coronavirus-closures">Continue reading...</a>
