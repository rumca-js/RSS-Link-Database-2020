That's the bad news. The worse news? It won't be the last.\n\nIn today's video I speak with bestselling author David Quammen about zoonotic viruses - viruses that jump from animals to humans. Why they're so dangerous, why we've been seeing more of them in recent years, and why COVID-19 will not be the last one we'll be dealing with.\n\nYou can find David's book, Spillover: Animal Infections And The Next Human Pandemic here:\nhttps://amzn.to/2UvmWcy\n\n\nWant to support the channel?
