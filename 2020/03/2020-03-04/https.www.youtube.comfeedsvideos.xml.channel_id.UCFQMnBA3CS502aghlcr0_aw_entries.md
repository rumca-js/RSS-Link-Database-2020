The amazon kindle publishing scam relies on people not understanding that the Kindle publishing ecosystem has dramatically changed.  Not to mention competition has gotten MUCH more intense. Like most online money making opportunities, you're gonna be making pennies, not dollars with these strategies. There are allegedly 5,000 people who fell for this program, RECENTLY, which is promoting an outdated system, with stolen earnings claims, and they're charging $697 for it.

Please note: I offered one of Ty Cohen's team a chance to come on the show and respond to Bobby's allegations and explain their side of the story. They declined to comment.
