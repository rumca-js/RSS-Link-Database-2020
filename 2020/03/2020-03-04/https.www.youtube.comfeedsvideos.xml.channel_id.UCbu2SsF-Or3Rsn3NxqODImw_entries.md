We got the chance to go hands-on with Animal Crossing: New Horizons at PAX East 2020. In this video we craft, re-arrange our furniture, try some new clothes, snitch on some residents, and explore the Museum.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is almost here, but we got a closer look at it during PAX East 2020. The series' debut on the Nintendo Switch includes a bunch of new features and changes that make this relaxing life-sim all the more exciting. There's a new town hall, a revamped Able Sisters clothing store, an extravagant upgrade to the museum, the new crafting bench, and tweaked home design mechanics. We explore and dig into all this in the video above.

New Horizons will introduce a significant crafting mechanic, where you'll gather different resources to build items like furniture and tools. You'll be able to customize your house similarly to Happy Home Designer, which makes decorating a bit easier. At the town hall, you can talk to Isabelle where to change the island's song or flag, and report things that you don't want in the game (such as inappropriate clothing designs that villagers might adopt from other islands). We also got a look at the myriad of cosmetics that'll be available; shirts, bottoms, hats, glasses, socks, shoes, and accessories are all customizable. Lastly, the museum has been renovated with an aquarium for fish, an exhibit for fossils, and a biodome for bugs--and it's lovely.

The game launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020, and for more on this adorable adventure, be sure to watch our video on 19 new things in Animal Crossing: New Horizons or read our preview from our previous hands-on demo. You can also read up on how New Horizons is handling save data recovery or how it's adopting a common shooter feature to make gameplay easier.

But how does it all work? GameSpot's Aaron Sampson breaks it all down in a video video. Check out the video above to find out how to buy one of the Tomogunchi pets and what you need to do to keep the little creature happy. In short, you're encouraged to keep playing … and playing well. If you keep losing, your pet can die, so stay frosty out there, soldiers. 

Be sure to watch the full video above to find out everything you need to know about Tomogunchi pets. The Tomogunchi pets arrive in Modern Warfare ahead of the rumored battle royale mode, Warzone, which is reportedly set to launch later this month.

## You Should Care About Doom Eternal's Multiplayer

Battlemode is Doom Eternal's multiplayer mode, which was built from the ground up. It's a 1v2 asymmetrical competitive mode where one player is Doom Slayer and two plays are demons. Doom Slayer functions just like he does in single-player with a full arsenal of weapons and all the abilities that help him rip and tear demons and help replenish resources. The demon side has five different ones to choose from: Archvile, Pain Elemental, Marauder, Revenant, and Manucubs. Each of them have different movement styles, attacks, and abilities, but they can all summon minion demons to help them fight Doom Slayer.

We recently had a chance to play Battlemode when we visited id Software's studio in Dallas, Texas, and came away impressed overall. It certainly takes some getting used to, especially for the demon side, but tug-of-war structure and pacing make for some real edge-of-your-seat moments. It captures a similar intensity found in the single-player when playing as Doom Slayer, and new layer of strategy spices things up when playing as the variety of demons.

You can watch us give our impressions in the video above. We also have an in-depth article on Doom Eternal's Battlemode on GameSpot which includes insight from game director Hugo Martin and executive producer Marty Stratton. For more on this intense combat-focused FPS, be sure to read our breakdown of Doom Eternal's first boss fight in the campaign or our initial preview of the opening three hours. Doom Eternal launches on March 20 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One, and a Switch version will come in the future.
