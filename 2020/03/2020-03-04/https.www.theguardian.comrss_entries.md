## Wayne Rooney: 'As a kid every half-time I argued with Ferguson'

<p>Before the FA Cup tie Derby’s player-coach discusses the way back for Manchester United and why his second Everton exit rankles</p><p>Four months on, the sight of Wayne Rooney in a Derby County tracksuit is still somewhat unusual. Even more so given he is discussing tackling Manchester United on Thursday, emitting a warm glow as he tries to sum up more than a decade at Old Trafford: 13 years, 12 trophies, 559 appearances and a record 253 goals. “I loved it there,” he says. “Some huge highs and some lows. When you’ve been somewhere so long, and you look back on it, your old teammates and the staff, it was the main part of my career. It was enjoyable and something I’ll look back on with great memories. There was obviously the time when I nearly left the club, which I regret. There were lows but they were certainly outweighed by the highs.”</p><p>For Rooney the FA Cup fifth round promises to be a special, if not a slightly strange occasion at a sold-out Pride Park but facing United is not an alien prospect after twice doing so on his return to Everton three years ago. By the end of the 2017-18 season, Everton deemed Rooney dispensable and he left for DC United until touching down at Derby. The muddiness of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/28/i-have-the-hunger-wayne-rooney-completes-move-to-dc-united" title="">that second Goodison Park exit</a> rankles. “It was a big thing for me to go back there. There were things that got said, or didn’t get said. At the end of the day all I wanted from Everton was a bit of honesty with the situation. I said to them: ‘I’m not a child, I’ll accept whatever you want to happen here.’ That was the only disappointment. But Everton is a fantastic club, I’m delighted for them bringing [Carlo] Ancelotti in and they look like they are thankfully, finally, moving forward.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/04/wayne-rooney-derby-manchester-united-fa-cup-argue-sir-alex-ferguson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Documentary The Booksellers captures the world of rare books, from hip-hop magazine collectors to private librarians, and a trade opened up and apart by the internet</p><p>The annual New York International Antiquarian Book Fair is a maze of glass shelves and display case lighting, a bounty of time portals in the arrangement of a sprawling jewelry convention. Two fourth-edition copies of Don Quixote ask for $120k, while another case contains JP Morgan’s copy of Shakespeare’s Third Folio. There’s a Hemingway archive containing a doll figure of Fidel Castro, cherubic face swallowed by a curly black beard, and a stand dedicated to ephemera of the occult.

Downing Street’s hostility to the civil service is a dangerous distraction from the task of governing in difficult times<p>Every prime minister has at some stage been <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201314/cmselect/cmpubadm/74/7407.htm" title="">frustrated</a> with the machinery of government. They feel it is not geared to delivering their manifestos or, in more paranoid moments, that civil servants are engaged in sabotage. But the current intensity of Downing Street’s hostility to Whitehall is abnormal. Boris Johnson does not stoop to public attacks on senior mandarins, but his aides and parliamentary outriders talk about the civil service as <a href="https://www.voanews.com/europe/britains-boris-johnson-takes-blob" title="">an enemy</a>. That view flows from the belief – not always wrong; usually exaggerated – that most civil servants thought Brexit was a mistake and approach it in terms of damage limitation. Mr Johnson wants the company of people who see only glorious opportunities in the UK’s separation from the EU. That prejudice breeds impatience with evidence and disregard for people who rely on it. That is a recipe for bad government.</p><p>Mr Johnson has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/sajid-javid-resigns-as-chancellor-amid-boris-johnson-reshuffle" title="">already lost a chancellor</a> by demanding that the Treasury surrender any independence from No 10. Sajid Javid resigned rather than tolerate institutional debilitation. Whether his successor, Rishi Sunak, puts up with it has yet to be seen. There might be gains in political efficiency from a submissive Treasury, but there are costs in downgrading a powerhouse of experience in economic policy. Suspicion of Whitehall also radiates from Downing Street’s defence of Priti Patel, the home secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/03/dominic-cummings-fostering-culture-of-bullying-says-labour" title="">over allegations of bullying</a>. It is normal for the prime minister to take an ally’s side when there are rival accounts of what has happened, but the anonymous Conservative “sources” who have been pressing Ms Patel’s case go much further. They accuse Home Office officials of campaigning against their boss because of her political stances. The ugly inference is that officials who say they have been bullied are lying and their motive is softness on immigration and crime.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/04/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-and-whitehall-stop-the-war">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sacked minister offers self-indulgent resignation speech after more bluster from Boris at PMQs</p><p>Those we haven’t loved. It’s yet to register with Andrea Leadsom that she was sacked by Boris Johnson in the February reshuffle. In her own mind she stepped down of her own accord despite repeated phone calls begging her to stay on, and no one has as yet been heartless enough to break the bad news to her. Which is how she came to make one of the least self-aware and most self-indulgent resignation speeches ever heard in the Commons.</p><p>It may even catch on. Last week we had Sajid Javid’s statement, which was all the more powerful for having delivered a warning shot to Boris Johnson. Andrea’s? Not so much. But if every third-rate minister who has been fired is now going to be awarded the primetime gig after PMQs to witter on about their non-existent achievements, then the next few months could get very busy. Priti Patel should probably book her slot now to avoid any future disappointment. It looks as if she’s going to need it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/04/andrea-leadsom-rewrites-her-history-in-desperate-dirge-of-denial">Continue reading...</a>

## Escape from Pretoria review – Daniel Radcliffe restages ANC prison break

<p>The real-life story of anti-apartheid activist Tim Jenkin makes for a tough, muscular drama</p><p>The rather amazing true story of the white ANC activist Tim Jenkin and his audacious escape from Pretoria Prison in apartheid-era South Africa is told in this capable and well-carpentered movie from British film-maker Francis Annan, adapted from Jenkin’s own book. The film has something pleasingly traditional about it, with tense nailbiting moments, slab-faced guards, and touches of The Great Escape and Papillon.</p><p>With long hair and straggly beard, Daniel Radcliffe plays Jenkin and Daniel Webber plays his fellow ANC activist Stephen Lee, imprisoned in 1978 for their “leaflet bombs” – firecracker-type devices left in the street which send blizzards of leaflets flying. Their prison is tough, but as they are white, it is not as tough it might have been. Inside, Jenkin and Lee meet another political prisoner and future escaper: Frenchman Leonard Fontaine (a slightly hammy turn from Mark Leonard Winter). He is evidently based on the Egyptian-born French national, Alex Moumbaris, with whom the men actually broke out, although it isn’t clear why his character has been fictionalised and the others not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/04/escape-from-pretoria-review-daniel-radcliffe-prison-drama">Continue reading...</a>

## Appropriation or plagiarism? Booker novel poses difficult question

<p>International Booker prize nominee Willem Anker has made use of Cormac McCarthy’s fiction - but is this sufficiently acknowledged?</p><p>Writing in the Observer in 1980, Martin Amis took to task a young New York-based writer, Jacob Epstein, for plagiarising him. In Wild Oats, <a href="http://movies2.nytimes.com/books/98/02/01/home/amis-epstein.html">Epstein had taken not just plot structures or character ideas from Amis’s debut</a>, The Rachel Papers, but had duplicated whole sentences. “The boundary between influence and plagiarism will always be vague,” Amis wrote – but Epstein had “decisively breached” that “hazy” line. Rather magnanimously, Amis went on to praise Epstein as a writer of talent; he simply believed that the similarities ought to be made public.<br /><br />That boundary remains hazy. Among the 13 novels longlisted for this year’s International Booker prize, announced last week, is Red Dog by Willem Anker, translated from Afrikaans by Michiel W Heyns. It tells the story of Coenraad de Buys, a seven-foot agent of war who lived and died in the violent, fractured Cape Colony. <a href="https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/mccarthy-cormac-blood-meridian-red-dog/">When I reviewed the novel, unfavourably, in the Times Literary Supplement</a>, my objections lay not just in what I found to be a derivative, repetitious and at times deeply unpleasant book, but in a few sections that bore a striking resemblance to those in Cormac McCarthy’s Blood Meridian, which raised – as I wrote then – “some discussion about the nature and justification of plagiarism”.</p><p>Take the following passage, in which Buys leads his gang of outlaws into an attack “like a horde from Hell more abhorrent even than the fire and brimstone land of Christian Reckoning, skirling and shrieking, clothed in smoke like those phantoms in regions beyond certainty and sense where the eye wanders and the lip shudders and drools.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/mar/04/appropriation-or-plagiarism-booker-novel-poses-difficult-question">Continue reading...</a>

She had repeatedly asked for an epidural; instead, she was allowed only gas and air and two paracetamol. She was “exhausted, dazed, torn, bloody and frightened” by the time her healthy son was placed in her arms.</p><p>“I asked three times for an epidural,” Kate says of her 26-hour labour to deliver her baby, who was back to back and breech. “The first time the midwives said I wasn’t far enough along.

Some of the examples – posted online by anonymous whistleblower CopyComic – date from 15 years back, before the internet made the exposure of joke theft far more likely. Big-hitters implicated in the scandal included French-Moroccan superstars Jamel Debbouze and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80170187">Gad Elmaleh</a>, who are said to have ripped off Dave Chappelle and Jerry Seinfeld respectively. Debbouze responded by saying he was inspired by, but did not model himself on, Chappelle; while Elmaleh claimed the accusations, while partly true, had been blown out of proportion.</p><p>It’s a story that is, paradoxically, a gift to comedy. The standup Shirley Souagnon refers to it at the start of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81008236">her Netflix set</a>, joking that she’s going to be performing Chris Rock jokes, the better to preserve her own material’s shelf life. It’s also a story that shores up our Anglo-Saxon sense of comic superiority. It’s an English-language artform, right? And we Brits are uniquely funny, n’est-ce pas?

The big-name titles, Street Fighter EX3 and Ridge Racer 5, were formulaic entries in tired legacy franchises. Meanwhile, Sega’s Dreamcast machine, released a year earlier, was hosting innovative hits such as Shenmue, Crazy Taxi and Power Stone. Had Sony stumbled after its hugely successful and highly disruptive original PlayStation?</p><p>No, it had not. It just took developers time to understand the architecture of this forward-looking console – especially its hyperbolically named Emotion Engine, the 128-bit central processing unit at the core of the box, designed to generate large, explorable 3D environments and fill them with life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/04/sony-playstation-2-at-20-console-future-of-gaming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gallic style is more in vogue than ever and the Paris fashion week trends will translate easily to our wardrobes</p><p><sup>‘</sup>You don’t have to be French to be a Parisian,” Karl Lagerfeld once said. Lagerfeld wasn’t one to sugarcoat his views on who was or wasn’t chic, so I have always been encouraged by his generosity here. As well as by the example of Betty Catroux – muse to Yves Saint Laurent, and the subject of <a href="https://museeyslparis.com/en/exhibitions/betty-catroux-yves-saint-laurent" title="">an exhibition just opened </a><a href="https://museeyslparis.com/en/exhibitions/betty-catroux-yves-saint-laurent" title="">at the YSL museum in the city</a> – who is Gallic chic to the core, but was born in Brazil. I have had two decades of Paris fashion weeks to try to master the faux-Parisian look and, while I still haven’t nailed it, I like to think I have picked up a bit here and there.</p><p>I have the getting-dressed equivalent of speaking holiday-French, I guess. I don’t pass for a native, but I can put together an outfit that allows me to get seated at Cafe de Flore on Boulevard Saint-Germain at a table that isn’t the one where the loo door bangs in your face.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/04/how-to-dress-like-a-parisian-big-coats-monochrome-and-a-splash-of-crimson">Continue reading...</a>

The neighbour dressed the Norwegian photographer in blue mourning clothes, as is custom, before bringing her into the kitchen where Koksi Leida’s body lay in an open casket.</p><p>During the ceremony, the women of the Baltic island prayed, mourned and sang, before the men arrived and the casket was taken outside. Witnessing these powerful moments of sisterhood transformed Gjelstad’s outlook. “This,” she says, pointing to an image of the women sitting around Leida, “is one of the most emotional moments I have experienced as a photographer. It was like going way back in time and being present at the same time. I thought I would do a book on Estonian handicrafts – but all of a sudden it was about the old women and their culture, which is changing so rapidly.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/04/isle-women-europes-last-matriarchy-anne-helene-gjelstad-kihnu-big-heart-strong-hands">Continue reading...</a>
