They feel it is not geared to delivering their manifestos or, in more paranoid moments, that civil servants are engaged in sabotage. But the current intensity of Downing Street\u2019s hostility to Whitehall is abnormal. Boris Johnson does not stoop to public attacks on senior mandarins, but his aides and parliamentary outriders talk about the civil service as <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/europe/britains-boris-johnson-takes-blob\" title=\"\">an enemy</a>. That view flows from the belief \u2013 not always wrong; usually exaggerated \u2013 that most civil servants thought Brexit was a mistake and approach it in terms of damage limitation.

It is normal for the prime minister to take an ally\u2019s side when there are rival accounts of what has happened, but the anonymous Conservative \u201csources\u201d who have been pressing Ms Patel\u2019s case go much further.
