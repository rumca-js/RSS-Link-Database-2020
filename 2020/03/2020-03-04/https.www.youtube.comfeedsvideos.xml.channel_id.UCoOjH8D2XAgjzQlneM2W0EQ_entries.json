They\u2019re able dictate how much they\u2019re willing to pay suppliers for their products because they\u2019re the biggest buyer. Instead of Walmart being a monopoly, it\u2019s a monopsony. \n\nDrug cartels have the same advantage\nMost of them don\u2019t grow their own drugs, they buy drugs from ordinary poor farmers, that are just trying to make a living\nThen they package it up and handle all the distribution to consumers. They\u2019re able to keep their costs down even when the farmer\u2019s costs go up\n\nMost retail businesses sell their products with around a 10 to 100% markup from the wholesale price\nMarkups in the drug business are a little bit more steep than that\nInstead of a 10-100% markup, going from $385 to $122,000 is more like a 30,000% markup\n\nBut it\u2019s still pretty profitable because drugs are kinda like the marketeer\u2019s dream\nSince man started selling products, they\u2019ve devised better and better ways to make their products more addictive. But drugs are as addictive as it gets!\n\nThe drug trade is the ultimate form of entrepreneurship\nInstead of a traditional market where anyone can easily set up shop, the drug trade is a network market, where a big part of your success is from the connections you have. How good are you at managing relationships? \n\nWith all this money on the line, drug traffickers have tried nearly every idea, so what innovation can you bring to the table\n\n\u201can organization\u2019s people are its most valuable asset\u201d If you want to build a drug cartel empire, then you\u2019re gonna need people. You have to recruit these people in secrecy, without job postings, whiling making sure they\u2019re not undercover cops, informants. If you\u2019re in policed countries like the US or UK, another great option is to use independent contractors\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
