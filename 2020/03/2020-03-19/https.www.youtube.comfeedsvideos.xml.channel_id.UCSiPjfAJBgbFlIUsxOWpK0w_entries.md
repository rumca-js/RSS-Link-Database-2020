LYRICS

You were trying to get me on the guest list
To a party that I didn’t want to go to
It’s surprising that you couldn’t guess that
It’s the last place that I’d ever want to go to

I could see it in their eyes they weren’t at all impressed
Always underdressed I thought
Hell no
Get me out of here
Won’t you get me out get me out get me out of here

Cause the lights are low
And feeling’s so
Embarrassing
And I want you so
Make it all go
Away

There’s a part of me that still believes that
I’ll never be the one they want to talk to
In my heart of hearts I know the secret
But the rest of me is hiding in the bathroom

And I smile so politely cause that’s what they taught me
No wonder they don’t like me
Oh hell no
Just get me out of here
Won’t you get me out get me out get me out of here

Cause the lights are low
And feeling’s so
Embarrassing
And I want you so
Make it all go
Away
