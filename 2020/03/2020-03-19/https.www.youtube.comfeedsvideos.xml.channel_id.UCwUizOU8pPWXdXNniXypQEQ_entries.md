Every Friday night I’ll be doing a LIVE stream comedy show until the quarantine is over! It’ll be a night out while you’re stuck at home with laughs, levity, and you’re favorite red-headed conscious comedian, me! The show will have stand up comedy, sketch comedy, and topical comedy. It’ll be kinda like Saturday Night Live except way more woke! The show is called Friday Night Still Alive! 

It’s 45-60 minutes of laughing away your stress! Click the link in my bio if you are interested in joining me. I’m just working out the tech details now and we’ll be starting one week from today. Click the link and I’ll keep you in the loop so you can have a Friday night out from your own home with me!
