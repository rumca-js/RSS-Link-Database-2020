It\u2019ll be a night out while you\u2019re stuck at home with laughs, levity, and you\u2019re favorite red-headed conscious comedian, me! The show will have stand up comedy, sketch comedy, and topical comedy. It\u2019ll be kinda like Saturday Night Live except way more woke! The show is called Friday Night Still Alive! \n\nIt\u2019s 45-60 minutes of laughing away your stress! Click the link in my bio if you are interested in joining me. I\u2019m just working out the tech details now and we\u2019ll be starting one week from today. Click the link and I\u2019ll keep you in the loop so you can have a Friday night out from your own home with me!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-KWhGwci74", "date_published": "2020-03-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
