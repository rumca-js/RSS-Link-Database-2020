This time I tried something different. Details below.\n\nEquipment used:\n- Elektron Octatrack MkII\n- Novation Circuit\n- Korg Minilogue\n- Korg Microkorg XL+\n- Teenage Engineering OP-1\n- iConnectAudio4+\n- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups\n- Fender Precision Bass\n- myVolts mickXer\n\nMusic-nerd stuff:\nThis jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.\nThe Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+ (ica4+), which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit, OP-1, Microkorg. I somehow couldn't get the Minilogue clock to work properly with the usb clock - will figure it out later. Also, the Microkorg tends to drift, so after many bars, the clock sometimes goes out of sync with the Octatrack, which is a bummer. Need to figure out a more robust system, perhaps with MIDI DIN.\nI didn't use the Octatrack Arranger mode this time - I just manually triggered the patterns when I felt like going to the next section. It's a bit more freeing than the previous track I did, but also requires more dancing about with the fingers, which takes me away from actually playing an instrument (esp guitar , which needs two hands) while transitioning. I did my best. Some minor stumbles but that's to be expected for a live jam. I hope you enjoyed this little explanation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MMNY3XgTvyQ", "date_published": "2020-03-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
