Thank you to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for partnering with us on this episode of SciShow. Visit https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/visit/exhibits/sea-otters/meet-our-otters to learn more about the Sea Otter Program. 

Did you know that some species take care of young that are not their own? This surprising practice is called alloparenting, and itâ€™s been observed in animals from otters, like Rosa and Selka, to birds to baboons! 

Following state recommendations to help slow the spread of COVID-19, the Monterey Bay Aquarium is temporarily closed. Their team is doing their best to bring you the Aquarium remotely. If you're looking for a moment of calm, we recommend tuning in to some of their live stream: https://www.youtube.com/user/MontereyBayAquarium/videos?view=2&sort=dd&live_view=501&shelf_id=18
