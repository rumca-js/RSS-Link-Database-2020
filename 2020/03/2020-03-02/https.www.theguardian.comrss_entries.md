It left local residents outraged, with many questioning the effectiveness of the police and security services in the battle against far-right extremism.</p><p>The Guardian’s Berlin bureau chief <strong>Philip Oltermann </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that this latest attack comes at a worrying time for Germany. There is political upheaval as Angela Merkel prepares to depart as chancellor, and meanwhile the far-right AfD is making gains. He says that while many in Germany’s security services were focusing on the rising threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism, they have been accused of downplaying the threat from neo-Nazi groups. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/mar/02/whats-behind-the-rise-of-germanys-far-right">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Fairfield Halls, London<br /></strong>In his show Taxi Tour, the comic from last year’s Britain’s Got Talent offers only standard-issue middle-aged standup </p><p>Kojo Anim was a star of the black standup circuit for years, but “Britain’s Got Talent changed my life,” he tells his Croydon crowd. The Londoner has booked his Taxi Tour off the back of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxdNKz1Uyik">an appearance in last year’s final</a>, and recounts how that brush with fame – and his Christian faith, and new fatherhood – picked him back up after a grim period in his life. The emotional honesty is refreshing, but plays only a cameo role in an otherwise unadventurous show. Anim certainly does have talent, but – on this evidence – it’s for performing, not for writing distinctive material.</p><p>The show opens with a justification for appearing on BGT, and an account of his experience of overnight celebrity. But it soon devolves into standard issue middle-aged standup comparing his unglamorous childhood with that of today’s pampered youth. His parents play their expected role, giving their son broad accents to mimic when not walloping him for the slightest impertinence. “Only an African parent,” reports our host ruefully, “will beat their own child when they see another child doing something.” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/02/kojo-anim-review-fairfield-halls-london">Continue reading...</a>
