A new boss named Doom Hunter makes its way into Doom Eternal, eyeing to kill the Doom Slayer, but we rip and tear right through it in this gameplay video.

Doom Hunter is one of the new bosses you’ll encounter towards the beginning of Doom Eternal. Doom Eternal is the sequel to 2016’s Doom, and part of the Doom franchise which started in the '90s. According to an in-game pop-up, the Doom Hunter is a Super Heavy Demon that specializes in long-range lock-on targets.

Doom Hunter’s weak points are its shield and sled. Destroying the shield with the Plasma Rifle can briefly disable it. If you destroy the sled you can permanently disable its protective shield and missiles. There are two phases to the fight, and other demons will spawn during the fight.

Doom Eternal is scheduled to release for PS4, Xbox One, Stadia, and PC on March 20, 2020. A Nintendo Switch version of Doom Eternal will be released at a later date. For all things Doom Eternal stay tuned to GameSpot!

One of 2020's most-anticipated games, Doom Eternal, is almost here. Ahead of its release on March 20, GameSpot caught up with id Software's Marty Stratton and Hugo Martin to discuss one of the game's most important and eye-catching elements--the weapons. 

In the video, Stratton and Martin explain the unique benefits of some of Doom Eternal's most impressive and useful weapons, including the combat shotgun, the heavy cannon, the plasma rifle, the rocket launcher, the super shotgun, the chain gun, and of course, the BFG. Each of the weapons can be altered with a mod that makes it even deadlier, which goes a long way toward helping you lay waste to demons.

Doom Eternal launches on March 20 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Fans have had to wait longer than expected, as the game was originally scheduled for release in November 2019 before being shifted to its new date in 2020. Keep checking back with GameSpot for lots more on Doom Eternal in the days and weeks to come!

Valve just released several gameplay teasers revealing some epic environments in City 17. We've compiled over 10 minutes showcasing combat, environment interactions, and various nail-biting encounters as Alyx faces off with some classic Half-Life enemies. Half-Life: Alyx comes out March 23rd on the Valve Index, Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Windows Mixed Reality headsets.

A new Half-Life game is almost here. It's been 13 years since Half-Life 2: Episode 2, and this month, anyone with PC VR platforms (Index, Rift, Vive, Quest with Oculus Link) will be able to play Half-Life: Alyx. In anticipation of its March 20 release date, developer Valve dropped three separate gameplay clips, which we've compiled into one for the video above.

Judging from the gameplay footage, Half-Life: Alyx looks like the unification of many VR mechanics and features we've seen up to this point in other games, but in one full 15-hour single-player campaign. Since the game takes place prior to the events of Half-Life 2, we're getting a new perspective on the struggle and oppression that litters City 17. You take on the role of Alyx Vance, who has been an important character throughout the Half-Life 2 saga--her father Eli Vance, genius scientist and good friend of Gordon Freeman, looks to be a centerpiece for the story as well. The Combine are onto her, and with a VR setup, you'll be in her shoes for this latest chapter in Half-Life's iconic universe.

For more on this wildly anticipated VR game, you can read through our Half-Life: Alyx trailer breakdown to get a better idea of what to expect. We've rounded up everything you need to know about Half-Life: Alyx if you're looking for pre-orders and info on how it works for VR.

Final Fantasy VII Remake is one of 2020's most-anticipated games, and it's coming soon. The long-awaited PS4-exclusive arrives in April, and GameSpot recently had an opportunity to play a chunk of the game. In a new video, Edmond Tran guides you through what he thinks about what he played during his four-hour demo.

Edmond played through Chapters 1, 2, and 7, as well as some of Chapter 10, so there is a lot to unpack. He talks about some of the unique elements that make Final Fantasy 7 Remake feel like a new game, including the new combat mechanics and what makes Midgar feel more alive than ever. Edmond also had things to say about the American voice cast for the new game, so be sure to watch the full video for all the nitty gritty details.

As announced previously, Final Fantasy 7 Remake will be released episodically, so what's available at launch is just the beginning.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake launches on April 10 for PS4. It's a timed-exclusive for PS4 until 2021, at which point it will presumably launch for other consoles and/or PC.

We take a look at how far Final Fantasy VII remake has come by comparing differents parts of the opening mission to the original.

Final Fantasy 7's opening sequence, known as the Bombing Mission, is one of the most recognizable moments in video game history. Whether you're a fan of Square Enix's RPG series or not, you'll no doubt be familiar with some element of: the exciting music, the sweeping camera movement that pulls viewers into the world of Migar, or Cloud's little backflip off the train. It's an iconic moment, which makes seeing it in the upcoming remake an exciting prospect.

Those that have been keeping up on the Final Fantasy 7 Remake news will know that the game will be quite significantly different to the original. Much of it will take place in Midgar, which means players will be seeing more of the city and undertaking a variety of new adventures there. With that in mind, how much has developer Square Enix changed the opening Bombing Mission sequence and the sequence immediately following it? Does it stay true to the original or has it been reworked? You can watch the video above and find out for yourself.

Final Fantasy VII Remake is scheduled to release on PS4 exclusively on April 10. The game's limited-time exclusivity is expected to last for a year, with releases expected thereafter.
