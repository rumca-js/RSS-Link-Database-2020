If you’re unfamiliar with Animal Crossing or haven’t played in a while it can be a bit overwhelming. Fortunately, we have some tips that should help you get through your first few days and weeks.

We've been enjoying Animal Crossing: New Horizons for the past few weeks and, like previous games in the franchise, there's a lot of systems to keep track of, activities to do, and milestones to meet. There's definitely a bit of a learning curve to it all.

In GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review in progress, Kallie Plagge writes, "New Horizons certainly has a slower pace than other Animal Crossing games, partially because you have to work to get things up and running on the island at the start. And while I'm impatient to discover what upgrades might be coming my way (and I need to mess around with Island Designer more), I still feel as though I've done a lot on my island. I've crafted tons of furniture, upgraded my house seven times, picked thousands of weeds, and done far too many drastic outfit changes. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am to decorate my island and make it my own, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future."
