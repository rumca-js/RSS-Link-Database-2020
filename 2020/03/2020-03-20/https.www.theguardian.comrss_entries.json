I thought I had been doing OK at keeping my anxiety levels manageable, but over the weekend I completely collapsed. It was all I could do to get out of bed around lunchtime and even taking the dog for a walk felt horribly scary. Mostly I just lay curled up in a sustained panic attack, obsessing about an increasingly uncertain future. My mother\u2019s care home is sensibly in lockdown with all visitors barred, so I have no idea when I will next see her. My daughter and her husband are in an increasingly quarantined Minneapolis with all flights cancelled for the foreseeable future. My son and his girlfriend are holed up in Brighton. Often at times like these, work proves an excellent distraction but now I was stuck in a Catch-22, as what I was writing about was the very thing I was anxious about, so I found myself unable to sketch for two days. I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to follow the news. But I am luckier than most. My wife, who has seen me in many similar previous meltdowns, was there for me. As were friends and colleagues at work. Not to mention, the small army of mental health professionals who have had my back for decades now. I\u2019d be lost without all of them. It\u2019s a privilege to feel this loved and cared for by so many people. I\u2019ve spent more time just chatting to people on the phone and checking we\u2019re all OK in the last week than I have in the previous year. Right now, it\u2019s simple one-day-at-a-time stuff. Sometimes even an hour at a time. But I\u2019m back writing again.
