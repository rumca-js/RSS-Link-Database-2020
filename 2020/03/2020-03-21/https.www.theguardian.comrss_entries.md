<p>Have a movie night in, say thank you and don’t blame her… loving your mother can make all the difference – to your own life as well as hers</p><p>If you’re lucky enough still to have her around, there’s no one on earth you go back further with than your mother. The bond between a mother and her adult child can be frenzied and fraught, loaded and exasperating, undermining and energy-sapping. As with all family relationships, so much of what’s going on is unsaid or coded. An outsider can only sense the ripples, while you are only too aware of the tsunami. But whatever it’s like, two things are true. First, this is a relationship that always matters; and second, it can always be improved. Here’s how.</p><p><strong>1. Accept that you can’t change her.</strong> “You can’t change anyone else,” says Philippa Perry, psychotherapist and author of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jul/10/the-book-you-wish-your-parents-had-read-philippa-perry-review" title="">The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read</a></em>. “But sometimes, if you change yourself, the other person will change as well. If you decide to be kind towards your mother, and accepting of her, that may shift your relationship. It’s not guaranteed, but it’s a possibility.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/21/mother-dearest-20-ways-to-love-your-mum">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Man suspected of loosening rail bolts on bridge between Cologne and Frankfurt<br /></p><p>A German man has been arrested on suspicion of having loosened the bolts on a high-speed train track between Cologne and Frankfurt.<br /><br />The man, described by Frankfurt’s state prosecutor as being “without fixed abode”, was arrested near Cologne on Friday night after police found specialist equipment for loosening track bolts in his car.<br /><br />Investigators reportedly tracked down the 51-year-old after a confession letter referring to the location of the attempted sabotage was sent to several politicians, including the chancellor, Angela Merkel.<br /><br />According to Der Spiegel, the suspect was only recently released from prison in Nuremberg, where he had served a sentence for attempted blackmail.<br /><br />German police had reported a “possible attack attempt” earlier on Friday after the driver of a high-speed Intercity Express train noticed something unusual in the early hours while crossing Theisstalbrücke bridge near Niedernhausen, just outside Frankfurt.<br /><br />Several trains had already passed over the damaged track before the tampering was uncovered, police said. If the loosened rails had not been reported early, one of the trains could have derailed off the 50m-high bridge, German media reported, citing investigators.<br /><br />The general prosecutor in Frankfurt would not comment on a motive for the attempted attack while investigations were ongoing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/german-man-held-over-attempted-high-speed-train-track-sabotage">Continue reading...</a>

## Jessie Reyez: Before Love Came to Kill Us review – an outrageously fine debut

<p>(FMLY/Island Records)<br />The Colombian-Canadian singer-songwriter delivers a deliciously dark debut</p><p>As the pop landscape becomes progressively bolder and more crowded, it becomes more difficult for any new artist to make an impact. The bandwidth is saturated. Billie Eilish is a hard act to follow; she has rewritten a lot of rules. “Attitude” is standard among R&amp;B singers, and is just as often a pose. Shock value depreciates. But on her debut album, the breakup-fuelled <em>Before Love Came </em><em>to Kill Us</em>, Toronto’s R&amp;B star-in-waiting Jessie Reyez makes herself unforgettable pretty much from the word go.</p><p>Her album, out on 27 March, opens with a toss of her mane. “I should have fucked your friends, it would have been the best revenge,” Reyez seethes – you can hear her eyes are narrowed. A little later in the song, Reyez imagines shooting that cheating ex. “If I blow your brains out I can guarantee that you’d forget her, if I blow your brains out, I can kiss it better.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/21/jessie-reyez-before-love-came-to-kill-us-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The singer, 45, talks about Strictly, Eternal, being voted Sexiest Woman of the Decade and not knowing who Jamie Redknapp was when she met him</p><p><strong>My kids watch </strong>my old pop videos and say, “Now you’re 45, you’ll have to keep your clothes on.” I’m like, “In the next one, I’m going to have five male models and wear less!” They think it’s disgusting. My 15-year-old refuses to tell me what his friends say. He’s very protective. He’s begun to play the role of my husband.</p><p><strong>I didn’t come</strong> from a privileged background. I came from a one-parent family in Lewisham with my mum. I won a scholarship to stage school and fell into Eternal. Suddenly we were selling millions of records, touring the world, and I was just miserable. Everyone thinks it’s all showbiz parties, but I was 20, sitting in hotel rooms on my own. All I knew was that I couldn’t carry on being so unhappy and homesick. My passion for singing and music was dying.

<p>The co-author of Data Feminism on the importance of recognising discrimination in algorithms, understanding it at a technical level – and introducing measures to stamp it out</p><p>Our ability to collect and record information in a digital form has exploded as has our adoption of AI systems, which use data to make decisions. But data isn’t neutral, and sexism, racism and other forms of discrimination are showing up in our data products. Catherine D’Ignazio, an assistant professor of urban science and planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), argues we need to do better. Along with Lauren Klein, who directs the Digital Humanities Lab at Emory University, she is the co-author of the new book <em><a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/data-feminism">Data Feminism</a></em>, which charts a course for a more equitable data science. D’Ignazio also directs MIT’s new Data and Feminism lab, which seeks to use data and computation to counter oppression<em>.</em></p><p><strong>What is data feminism and why do we need it?<br /></strong>It is data science with an intersectional feminist lens. It takes all inequality into account at every stage of the data processing pipeline, including gender discrimination but also other forms of intersecting discrimination like racism, classism and ableism. And the reason we need it is to stop producing harmful racist and sexist data products.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/mar/21/catherine-dignazio-data-is-never-a-raw-truthful-input-and-it-is-never-neutral">Continue reading...</a>

Surely he had Franz Schubert (1797-1828) in mind when he wrote those words, though. In Schubert’s case it’s as often the change from minor to major, the light that comes from darkness, the smile out of the frown, that is strange, and affecting. Our own goodbyes, courtesy of Covid-19, include a farewell to normal concert life. There’s no “ev’ry time” here.

<p>The elder, pioneering Williams sister was being written off. But she triumphed in a breathless, tense match, despite spending the day before the final fighting for equal prize money</p><p>Before there was ever Serena Williams, there was Venus. These days it can be easy to forget that, removed as we are 12 years from Venus’s seventh and last slam triumph, at Wimbledon in 2008. As Serena has risen from star to cultural icon, Venus continues to compete but she is nearly 40 now. She is almost at her end.<br /><br />Fifteen years ago, many concluded she was already there. Venus arrived at Wimbledon in 2005 having suffered the embarrassment of being outplayed at Roland Garros by a 15-year-old from Bulgaria named Sesil Karatantcheva. The American had tumbled from the top 10. She was struggling. People argued her outside interests were eating her game from within, pointing out she had reached her first slam final aged only 17. Perhaps it made sense she was done at 25.<br /><br />After starting timidly at Wimbledon, Williams’s level hit the stratosphere. She marched to the final by sidestepping the defending champion, Maria Sharapova, in a loud, combative, unforgettable classic. At the final hurdle stood the world No 1, Lindsay Davenport, perhaps the cleanest ball-striker the sport has ever seen. As the contest unfolded, Davenport took control, easily matching her opponent’s power and with added, vicious precision. Davenport served for the title at 6-4, 6-5.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/21/my-favourite-game-venus-williams-v-lindsay-davenport-2005-wimbledon-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As trainer consumption booms, so does the number of unwanted shoes. Can anything be done with them?</p><p>Sneaker Con is an aircraft-hangar-sized convention that smells worse and worse as the day goes on. I am at the London edition of the event, but it’s just been in Las Vegas, and is soon due to be in Berlin, then New York. Thousands of sneakerheads have paid the £25 entry fee and are browsing merchandise stalls piled high with sneakers. The price tags on these shoes are not for the faint-hearted: £550, £600, £700.</p><p>The attendees are approximately 95% male. Of the women here, many are the mothers of young boys. One of the few women not chaperoning a child is Helen. She lives in a rented three-bedroom house on the outskirts of London with her husband, Luke, and his collection of trainers. The shoes have filled up the loft and the spare room. When they began to invade her bedroom, Helen told Luke she needed some space. The couple booked a table at Sneaker Con, where their stall is piled with trainers which cumulatively cost tens of thousands of pounds. This expense has become a source of tension. “That’s why he had to stop,” Helen tells me. “Some are quick-strike releases: we’d be on a night out and have to pull over on the motorway to follow a Twitter link to get a pair of trainers.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/21/some-soles-last-1000-years-in-landfill-the-truth-about-the-sneaker-mountain">Continue reading...</a>

The drama of creation and the expert rendering of the artistic process enhance the story of a woman’s struggle<p>This story of high drama and tortured creativity in the art world opens in a decidedly muted fashion. Eve Laing, once the muse to a celebrated portrait painter, is at the height of her career as an artist, and is watching life as she knows it unravel. <em>Nightshade</em> follows her on one nocturnal walk from her former marital home in a privileged corner of west London to her studio in a deprived area of east London. As she walks, she muses on a past whose more interesting elements are subsumed by fairly standard life events. So far, so understated.</p><p>The “show reel of memories” forms a large part of a novel tracing Eve’s often predictable history, from student days in London to life as a young artist in New York. Her lover, the notorious Florian Kiš, immortalises her in his portrait Girl with a Flower, and yet she is obliged to hide in the bathroom listening to his other sexual conquests. Eventually, Eve shakes him off to pursue her own vision; the work that makes her name is Underground Florilegium, a tube map featuring flowers in place of stations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/21/nightshade-annalena-mcafee-review">Continue reading...</a>

## I grew up watching disaster movies. Here’s what I’ve learned | Hadley Freeman

<p>From Armageddon to Outbreak, there’s something reassuring about their predictability, now more than ever<br /></p><p>For reasons I don’t need to spell out, I’ve been thinking a lot about disaster movies recently. I had to leave my home yesterday, something I – a deeply lazy person – avoid even in the healthiest of times, and it really was extraordinary how cinematic London was looking. Being American, London always looks cinematic to me, but on this occasion it seemed a lot more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/01/artsfeatures7" title="">28 Days Later </a>than Mary Poppins. Public transport was so empty that when a busker came into the train carriage it was just him singing Send In The Clowns directly to me, an audience of one. It was simultaneously the most romantic/awkward thing that has ever happened to me, and I was so moved/mortified that I gave him a fiver and rushed back to the safety of home, like everyone else.</p><p>As a teenager of the 90s, I grew up watching disaster movies. Some people (my parents) might have thought that all those hours spent at the Odeon with Armageddon, Twister, Titanic and (perhaps most pertinently) Outbreak were yet more grains of sand of my life that I was merrily chucking into the void. In fact, I was nobly preparing myself for this moment. Disaster films teach us that, even while the world becomes scary and unmanageable, there are only half a dozen types of people, and there is something deeply reassuring about that predictability, now more than ever. So ask yourself: which disaster movie cliche do you want to be?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/21/i-grew-up-watching-disaster-movies-heres-what-ive-learned">Continue reading...</a>

<p> Yes, it’s watching other people have the holiday of a lifetime – but it also captures the highs and lows of travel in all its glory </p><p>Here’s something unusual about Race Across the World (Sunday, 8pm, BBC Two), a sort of competitive gap year where five pairs compete to cross South America on the tightest budget in the shortest time in an effort to have the most annoying conversations back home with the people they know: I have ended up, against my better judgment, liking the contestants.</p><p>Something about this feels fundamentally wrong. The TV arc I am used to is meeting various sets of people willing to participate in a reality TV programme, which already marks me against them (Step 1); making impulsive snap judgments based on accents, the way they look, or one slightly annoying thing they said in their intro reel (Step 2); spending more time with them and having my early impulses proved correct and, quite often, magnified (Step 3); then, in the final episode, watching one person win over all others and feeling nothing (Step 4). That is TV as I know it and how I like it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/race-across-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steve Jarvis lost his sight but not his love of football in a 1984 accident. With his son’s help his journey has been remarkable</p><p>“It knocked me out for 71 days in total,” says Steve Jarvis, retracing the chain of events that left him blind and in a coma after a motorcycle accident in November 1984. A smattering of silence follows but then his overwhelming zest for life, gratitude and uplifting positivity become clear. While he was in Poole hospital, his then girlfriend, now wife, Jane, sent a letter and tape to the then Southampton manager, Lawrie McMenenemy, who duly recorded a message.</p><p>“It might well have been the reason I came around. Thanks, Lawrie!” Steve says, laughing. “He just said: ‘When you’re back up and well, come and see us.’ That’s what I did; I went and met all the players back in ’85. I’ve still got the tape; it will always be in my possession. I’ll always keep it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/blind-southampton-fan-love-football-dad-son-steve-jarvis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In Everything Is Alive, inanimate objects are given a voice – with hilarious and surprisingly moving results </p><p>When you dry yourself off after a shower, how does the towel feel about it? Do your front teeth look forward to your lover kissing you? And does a balloon find joy in helping us celebrate, or is it consumed by a fear of bursting? If none of these questions has ever troubled you, prepare for your brain to be rewired by <a href="https://www.everythingisalive.com/">Everything Is Alive</a>, a podcast from the Radiotopia stable that has found a loyal audience despite its outlandish premise. The host, Ian Chillag, interviews objects, and the objects talk back: the result is a ridiculous comedy with surprising philosophical chops.</p><p>Everything Is Alive is peppered with funny moments, from <a href="https://www.everythingisalive.com/episodes/louis-can-of-cola">a can of cola called Louis </a>recalling the traumatic experience of being part-frozen when he got pushed to the back of the fridge, to Sean the subway seat bitching furiously about the seat opposite. But it is all played straight. Chillag and his collaborators – usually actors or comedians with improv experience – never laugh, nor acknowledge the absurdity of what they’re doing. What emerges is that most precious of things: a stupid idea that is made to work by the total conviction with which it’s executed. “I cut out things that I love, really funny jokes,” Chillag says, down the line from New York. “I’ll sacrifice laughs to maintain that fragile suspension of disbelief. The flatness of the show is a big part of making it feel real. That’s also why I produce it through improvisation rather than scripting it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/21/ever-wondered-what-your-cola-can-thinks-of-you-this-podcast-has-the-answers-everything-is-alive">Continue reading...</a>

Faced with a flood of images that includes migrant children in cages, melting glaciers and forest fires, it has felt impossible to process information, let alone assess the best way to react.</p><p>We’ve entered an era characterised by the twin forces of speed and instability, in which a superabundance of potential threats – running from Islamic State to nuclear war, the rise of the far right, Brexit, environmental catastrophe and now a global pandemic – is matched by a dearth of time in which to process them. It’s impossible to keep up, and far too alarming to look away. Thanks to the accelerating effects of social media, it’s begun to seem as if the social landscape is shifting at such a rate that thinking, the act of making sense, is permanently balked. It’s increasingly difficult to distinguish real danger from rumours, speculations, conspiracy theories and deliberate lies, a process the spread of coronavirus around the globe has only intensified. Logging into Twitter or following the rolling news has meant being trapped in a spin-cycle of hypervigilant anxiety.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/21/feeling-overwhelmed-how-art-can-help-in-an-emergency-by-olivia-laing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The wealthy and the powerful are counting on us not paying attention. They’re looking out for their own while we are left on a sinking ship</p><p>Celebrities have always been the symmetrical, smiling face of wealth inequality. Their role in modern life is as paradoxical as trickle-down economics: to be preternaturally charming and attractive, but also relatable and attainably aspirational. We speak of “liking” one celebrity and “disliking” another on the basis of the professionally calibrated personas they beam out to us as sincerity. We enjoy their work – their acting, their singing, their athleticism – and we cheer on their successes. They are purveyors of a great American myth: that there is such a thing as “well-earned” luxury, or a “deserving” millionaire.</p><p>And in America, fame doesn’t just make you rich: it makes you a role model. So it makes sense that over the past, terrifying week – a week which has set the foundation of modern life shaking like the San Andreas fault – we have seen a slew of beloved celebrities solemnly, dutifully announcing that they have received a positive test result for Covid-19.

## Taking the Mickey: how Disney swallowed up all of culture

<p>Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars... the Mouse House’s empire keeps on expanding. But have recent developments shown the chinks in its armour?</p><p>So all-consuming and all-conquering has Disney become, it even owns the rights to its analogies now. First Disney was Marvel supervillain Thanos, relentlessly acquiring pop culture’s Infinity Stones including Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel itself – all the better to obliterate half the Hollywood universe. Having swallowed up its rival 21st Century Fox for a colossal $71bn, Disney became the Death Star – an empire so intimidatingly huge and hungry it reduced its rivals to the status of scattered rebels. Last year, Disney dominated the movies like no studio has before, taking more than 38% of the world’s box office. Now, with its streaming service <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/12/which-streaming-stick-should-i-buy-for-disney">Disney+</a> rolling out, Disney is like Simba in The Lion King: as Mufasa tells him, “everything the light touches is our kingdom”.</p><p>Maybe not quite everything, yet. But Disney’s gravitational pull is warping the very space-time continuum of the media landscape. You will have to work harder than ever to escape the Magic Kingdom’s reach. If it doesn’t get you with the Avengers, it will get you with The Simpsons, or <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/">National Geographic</a>, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/wes-anderson">Wes Anderson</a>. If it doesn’t get you with Elsa sticking plasters, it will get you with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/03/baby-yoda-the-mandalorian-star-wars">Baby Yoda</a> memes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/21/taking-the-mickey-how-disney-swallowed-up-all-of-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Football takes back seat during coronavirus crisis as Liverpool and Everton rally round communities and regular haunts</p><p>The Winslow on Goodison Road would have been heaving with Evertonians before and after the Merseyside derby on Monday but never opened its doors because of the suspension of the Premier League. Unless football resumes inside the stadium opposite within two months, they may not open again. “We just have to take it on the chin and try to recover,” says the pub’s general manager, Dave Bond.</p><p>The Arkles on Anfield Road might well have staged a title-winning party for Liverpool fans this Saturday, many having circled Roy Hodgson’s return with Crystal Palace as the day their 30-year wait was most likely to end. “Saturday will feel hollow for me as a Liverpool fan of over 50 years,” admits Paul Tremarco, the pub’s manager. “But even for a passionate football fan sport takes second place at the moment.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/21/merseyside-red-blue-mobilise-fight-save-local-livelihoods-liverpool-everton-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

## My tip for self-isolation? It’s best not to stockpile books

<p>From apocalyptic themes to audiobooks – pointers from a specialist in staying at home</p><p>I’m the sort of person who stays in the house for fun. Really. When people ask what I’m doing, expecting that the life of an author is a socially busy one full of launches and parties, I laugh. I mean, it is, and could be, but no thank you. When I’m not in meetings that could have been emails, or sitting with a Word doc open in front of me, begging the words to come, I’m flying through books, or watching music videos on TV.</p><p>So, here for you, are my book-based tips for self-isolation: 1) Don’t go out and buy a thousand books. Much like holiday reading, you almost certainly won’t get through them all. Your to-be-read pile will be too overwhelming and reading might feel like a chore. Three is enough for now and we don’t need any more looting. I’ve had an absolute nightmare finding oat milk this week. 2) Keep your reading relatively light. I probably wouldn’t read anything apocalypse-themed for now. We’re all anxious enough without having to think about how we’ll recreate <em>Station Eleven</em> by Emily St John Mandel. 3) If your eyes are tired and you need to switch it up, download yourself an audiobook. Most of the joy of reading without having to do anything. 4) Keep hydrated. But that’s just a rule for life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/21/book-based-tips-for-self-isolation-apocalypse-themed">Continue reading...</a>

## Four urns for four relatives. But why are they still on my mantelpiece?

<p>When I inherited four sets of ashes, I didn’t plan to keep them at home. But scattering them wasn’t as simple as I had thought</p><p>The candlesticks and photo frames that usually adorn our mantelpiece have been usurped by four less conventional ornaments, and it doesn’t take long for visitors to notice. “Are they... ashes?” Well, yes – but they’re not so much a macabre display of what Americans call “cremains” as a small warehousing operation; we’re working on the logistics to enable their respective onward journeys, but for now they are stuck here, above our fireplace. Visitors have other questions: why the Russian hats? Why is that one just a cardboard box? Let me explain.</p><p>In December 2016, my 70-year-old Uncle Rod, my mum’s younger brother, died. His will, of which I was executor, left his body to medical science. Skeletal and riddled with metastases as he was, the doctors politely declined the gift. His will’s small print stipulated that anything left after his dissection should be cremated and scattered into the Avon from the Ashton Avenue Bridge, near his beloved Bristol City football ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/21/ashes-on-mantelpiece">Continue reading...</a>
