Doom Eternal's arsenal is full of weapons that have been around in the franchise for a long time, but they've gotten some significant tweaks and improvements in id Software's latest title. You'll recognize quite a few of your guns in Eternal from Doom 2016, but in the sequel, they often hit harder, look cooler, and sound better. Check out the video above to see a comparison of each of the returning weapons in Doom Eternal and how they've been tweaked since your last venture to Hell.

One of the biggest changes in Doom Eternal is the way its weapons give you more options in combat. While you'll have a lot of the same guns and mods as in Doom 2016, you'll often find those weapons have new uses in Eternal. Many demons now have weak points that you can pick off if you have the right weapon, knocking off their guns or limbs and reducing their monstrous lethality. While your guns give you a lot of different ways of ripping and tearing through the legions of Hell, you'll often need to think about the best gun to take out an enemy quickly if you want to stay alive.

Understanding the intricacies of Doom Eternal's weapons is an essential part of the experience. As GameSpot's Phil Hornshaw put it in his Doom Eternal review in progress, "Though it can take a bit to get the hang of it, the intricacies of Doom Eternal's combat, combined with its enhanced mobility and option-heavy level design, create a ton of white-knuckle moments that elevate everything that made Doom 2016 work so well."

We spent some time diving into the dark corners of the game to see what strange things we could find.

From giant green fish and skateboards, to toy demons and the Doom Slayer’s pet rabbit Daisy, we do our best to find every Easter Egg in Doom Eternal. 

Doom Eternal is stuffed with hilarious Easter eggs and callbacks to not only past Doom games, but other all of id Software's games. There's so much chances are you won't catch them all, which is why we've compiled as many as we could possibly find, just for you!

In GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review in progress, Kallie Plagge writes, "New Horizons certainly has a slower pace than other Animal Crossing games, partially because you have to work to get things up and running on the island at the start. And while I'm impatient to discover what upgrades might be coming my way (and I need to mess around with Island Designer more), I still feel as though I've done a lot on my island. I've crafted tons of furniture, upgraded my house seven times, picked thousands of weeds, and done far too many drastic outfit changes. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am to decorate my island and make it my own, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future."
