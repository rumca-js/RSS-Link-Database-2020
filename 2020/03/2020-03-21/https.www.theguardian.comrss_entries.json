Three is enough for now and we don\u2019t need any more looting. I\u2019ve had an absolute nightmare finding oat milk this week. 2) Keep your reading relatively light. I probably wouldn\u2019t read anything apocalypse-themed for now. We\u2019re all anxious enough without having to think about how we\u2019ll recreate <em>Station Eleven</em> by Emily St John Mandel. 3) If your eyes are tired and you need to switch it up, download yourself an audiobook. Most of the joy of reading without having to do anything. 4) Keep hydrated.
