Not many people wander around on the ice; I guess I was a bit of a curiosity.” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/mar/14/ice-ice-baby-fishing-huts-of-lake-winnipeg-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

The day after International Women’s Day, shortly before Harvey Weinstein was handed his 23-year jail sentence, and days before Kate Beckinsale outlined a run-in with the rapist movie mogul in which he called her a “cunt” for wearing a suit to a premiere, the British lingerie company Agent Provocateur released an underwear campaign celebrating “the unparalleled potential of the female physique”.</p><p>It opens with a woman’s bottom and closes with another’s cleavage. But here’s the twist. The bottom and breasts belong to four high-profile athletes – British gymnast Georgia-Mae Fenton, Canadian pole vaulter Alysha Newman, American climber <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/16/sasha-digiulian-climber" title="">Sasha DiGiulian</a> and American hurdler Queen Harrison Claye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/14/the-rebranding-of-sex-underwear-hitches-ride-on-metoo-bandwagon">Continue reading...</a>

## Downton-shaped hole in your life? Belgravia is here to fill it

<p>In ITV’s new show based on a book by Julian Fellowes, much of the drama comes from people whispering about manners</p><p>Hmm, what if Downton Abbey, but <em>again</em>?<strong> </strong>I know you were wondering about it, and I was wondering too, and clearly so were ITV execs, who have commissioned one of Julian Fellowes’s books – about the intersection of high society and low, set against the distant, foggy, soft threat of war – and basically it is Downton Abbey, but again, only this time it is called Belgravia.</p><p>The thing is, I don’t particularly see anything wrong with making another jelly from the Downton mould, because the first did such a good job of pleasing the party. If you are a Downton head, do these scenes from <a href="https://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week12/belgravia">Belgravia</a> (Sunday, 9pm, ITV) not all sound delicious? A young servant girl struggles to step in pace while calling her young mistress “Miss!”; a patriarch of low birth sternly corrects a young soldier who addresses him by a slightly incorrect title; mother frets about the party; a gruff older butler keeps a hot-headed young servant boy in check by saying something like: “Master’s always been very fine to me, very fine indeed”; someone dies of an illness that could easily be treated with paracetamol; after a tense dinner, someone pours port out of a slender crystal decanter; a room full of women in fine silk gloves titter when someone mildly poorer than them walks in. You get the idea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/14/belgravia-downton-fellowes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His new graphic novel, Dragman, follows the adventures of a cross-dressing superhero. The artist explains how drawing the character made him realise he’d had enough of leading a double life</p><p>Back in 2002, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/steven-appleby" title="">Steven Appleby </a>inadvertently outed himself in a comic strip about a cross-dressing superhero saving fashion victims from pinstripes and overalls. The strip, published in the Guardian, brought “Dragman” swooping down to earth in a mauve ballgown and yellow wig. Although Appleby had been out for several years to his close friends and family, he realises now that the new character embodied an urge to go further. “I’d had enough of leading a double life. Cross-dressing in secret once or twice a week felt dishonest and stifling,” recalls the 64-year-old artist. “I’d learned to be comfortable with being a transvestite and now I was desperate to live as one.”</p><p>Eighteen years later,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review" title=""> </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review" title="">Dragman</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/03/dragman-steven-appleby-graphic-novel-review" title=""> </a>is back as the star of his own book. His adventures take him from the tip of the Shard to a fetish club deep beneath London’s railway arches, on the trail of a serial killer who specialises in murdering transvestites. But before he can solve the crimes he has first to overcome the enmity of a superhero community that is not only transphobic but has banned any rescue that is not strictly covered by insurance. By instinctively saving a young girl as she plummets off a rooftop, Dragman has outlawed himself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/14/steven-appleby-wanted-to-be-joined-up-person-dragman">Continue reading...</a>

<p> When he no can longer lie or deny, he’ll blame immigrants, journalists, people of color, liberals and other enemies </p><p>Donald Trump’s Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn’t even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration">failing</a>” testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening.</p><p>Trump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care <a href="https://www.businessinsider.nl/presentation-us-hospitals-preparing-for-millions-of-hospitalizations-2020-3?international=true&amp;r=US">running into the millions</a> and only about 45,000 ICU beds <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html">available</a> in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/trump-may-exploit-coronavirus-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

But who these days has the money for the former, or the time for the latter? Nowadays, the surest signs that you’ve reached maturity are an obsession with property magazines and a fascination with the quality of your sleep. Going by this criteria, I am more middle-aged than the most middle-aged sitcom dad ever (Darrin from Bewitched, who, Google informs me, was played by an actor five years younger than me when the show started. I am totally and definitely fine about this.)</p><p>I am fascinated with sleep – but nowhere near as fascinated as everyone else, it seems. I can hardly walk down the street without someone telling me about their latest sleep app, or reading an article about “good sleep hygiene”, or hearing how sleep deprivation is the health equivalent of chaining 40 Benson &amp; Hedges a day, and of course how tired – so very, very tired – everyone is, because they didn’t get their requisite eight hours last night.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/good-sleep-hygiene-new-wellness-goal-baby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Corporate control is a curse for farmers like Rudy Howell who are burdened with debt and have no alternative buyers</p><p>Back in the 1990s, Rudy Howell, then in his mid-50s, took over his father-in-law’s poultry contract business in North Carolina. He and his wife hoped it would provide a decent income they could combine with their small pensions to fund a comfortable retirement.</p><p>Instead, Howell, now 70, finds himself working long hours, deep in debt and earning less than $40,000 (£30,654) in 2019 – well below the average US wage. He spoke to the Guardian about his situation. “It doesn’t matter what I do, I can’t get above water. I do the same thing every time and the payout per flock can vary by as much as $8,000. Our output depends on their input.”<br /><br />Like nearly <a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2019/july/marketing-and-production-contracts-are-widely-used-in-us-agriculture/">90% of </a><a href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/amber-waves/2019/july/marketing-and-production-contracts-are-widely-used-in-us-agriculture/"> US poultry producers</a> Howell is not an independent farmer who can buy and sell his chickens to whoever he wants. He is contracted exclusively to Perdue Farms, one of the largest poultry companies in the US. The company, which produces a number of other agricultural products and services, generates more than $6bn a year in revenue.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/14/i-cant-get-above-water-how-americas-chicken-giant-perdue-controls-farmers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Want help without spending a fortune? These could be the answer</p><p>I’ve been reading US beauty magazines my entire adult life, but feel the Atlantic divide most acutely when they casually suggest “asking your dermatologist”, as though all readers have a skin doctor on speed dial, waiting to advise on every line and pimple. The British system is, of course, entirely different, focused on free-at-the-point-of-delivery healthcare; any GP would rightly need to see a legitimate and unresponsive skin condition to even consider a referral to a consultant.</p><p>Nevertheless, it’s still entirely reasonable to have concerns about skin, whether driven by health or vanity, and to want to seek expert help without dropping £250 for half an hour with a derm. It’s also possible that a prescription-strength product (containing higher levels of active ingredients) will work beyond the reach of a retail equivalent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/14/the-best-online-skincare-experts-sali-hughes">Continue reading...</a>

Several women had dressed up and bought tickets to the televised event at the Royal Albert Hall in London and, at the height of proceedings, threw flour bombs and shook loud rattles, leading to the programme being taken off air and sending the host, the US comedian Bob Hope, scuttling backstage. The massive success of that action taught me that huge change can come from women being inventive and brave.</p><p>At a screening of the film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/10/misbehaviour-review-1970-miss-world-contest-keira-knightley-jessie-buckley">Misbehaviour</a>, based on that protest, I was honoured to sit next to a couple of elderly women who had taken part in the protest.

<p>From cold-water swimming to gardening, the psychological benefits of the great outdoors have inspired a growing genre of books, but can nature improve our mental health?</p><p>There is a revealing moment in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/isabelhardman" title="">Isabel Hardman</a>’s book where the author, a political journalist who lives with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/post-traumatic-stress-disorder" title="">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, joins a forest therapy session. The therapist encourages her to “connect” with herself and “experience nature better”. Hardman wanders through the wood and finds a small hornbeam, which is twisting up towards the light, struggling to make its way in the shade of a mature oak. She is attracted to its shape, admires its bark, and draws parallels with her own life: how long it takes to heal and grow, how the scars we gather can still be beautiful “like the zig-zagging trunk of this young tree”. She reaches up and snaps one of its twigs: the tree is dead.</p><p>“Serves me right for being so dreadfully whimsical,” Hardman writes. “There seemed to be no neat life lesson here, nothing you’d want to write on a fridge magnet or share on social media. I’d come here hoping to connect with myself, and instead I’d been drawn to a tree that was secretly dead.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/14/wild-ideas-how-nature-cures-are-shaping-our-literary-landscape">Continue reading...</a>

Could a socialist become US president? The Bernie Sanders ultras on the self-proclaimed “dirtbag left” certainly thought so.

<p>In the early 90s, Donald Trump judged the world’s biggest modelling competition - since hit by allegations of abuse. This is how the people who were there remember it. </p><p>Special investigation by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/lucy-osborne">Lucy Osborne</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harry-davies">Harry Davies</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner">Stephanie Kirchgaessner</a></p><p>On 1 September 1991, a large private yacht cruised towards the Statue of Liberty. It was a clear, breezy evening, and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York, a golden sunset could be seen glinting off the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, a party was in flow. Scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and miniskirts, some as young as 14, danced under disco lights. It could have been a high school prom, were it not for the crowd of older men surrounding them.</p><p>As the evening wore on, some of the men – many old enough to be the girls’ fathers, or even grandfathers – joined them on the dancefloor, pressing themselves against the girls. One balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models, leering into a film camera that was documenting the evening: “Can you get some beautiful women around me, please?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/teen-models-powerful-men-when-donald-trump-hosted-look-of-the-year">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thanks to a decade of austerity, the Tories have ensured the pandemic will hit the poor the hardest </p><p>The British class system is, at its worst, a killer.

Meanwhile, Britain’s army of precarious workers have nowhere to hide, including from employment that puts their health at risk.

<p>For Trump, who has spent years undermining experts, scientists, and trust in government, the pandemic has shown his weaknesses<br /></p><p>It was just before 9am and the sky was overcast when a small group of reporters were suddenly ushered through the White House’s south portico. They gathered in <a href="http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/diplomatic-room.htm">the diplomatic reception room,</a> once home to Franklin Roosevelt’s “fireside chats”, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal.</p><p>Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn – more than three times what the president himself had requested – and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-response-trump-us">Continue reading...</a>

## And Then We Danced review – heady tale of forbidden desire

<p>Tbilisi is the setting for this charged romance between two men training as traditional Georgian dancers</p><p>Real-life dancer Levan Gelbakhiani is Mehrab, a redhead with round, watchful eyes training as part of the National Georgian Ensemble in Tbilisi. It’s in his blood – his delinquent older brother David (Giorgi Tsereteli) is a dancer too, as were his parents and ageing grandmother. A macho discipline that comprises forceful military moves and elaborate, athletic leaps, the tradition of Georgian dancing contains “no room for weakness” and certainly “no sex”, according to Mehrab’s teacher. Enter new student Irakli (Bachi Valishvili), tall, dark and handsome with a twinkle in his eye and a spring in his step that knocks Mehrab sideways. Swedish writer-director Levan Atkin’s heady third feature is attuned to the way desire has a tendency to throw everyday mundanities into sharp relief.</p><p>Mehrab is indifferent when dance partner Mary (Ana Javakishvili) falls asleep on his shoulder, but when it’s Irakli, he’s silently elated. Most of the boys’ increasingly charged interactions play out in the studio before the sun has risen, and after hours, over a lamp’s orange glow; cinematographer Lisabi Fridell bathes their blooming attraction in syrupy amber light. A street lamp illuminates a private show and turns it gold, as Mehrab dances shirtless for Irakli to Robyn’s seductive track Honey. This awakening eventually leads him to one of Tbilisi’s underground gay clubs. Gelbakhiani is commanding in his first acting role, metabolising heartbreak and moving with an irrepressible prowling sensuality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/14/and-then-we-danced-review-gay-romance-tbilisi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The selection’s fourth in the Welsh National suggests it is only a matter of time before he collects a prize over fences</p><p>The Midlands Grand National at Uttoxeter, racing’s annual hangover cure after the excesses of Cheltenham, can fall to <strong>Prime Venture</strong> <strong>(3.35)</strong>, who looks overpriced at 10-1 or thereabouts. He has yet to win over fences but it is surely only a matter of time in light of efforts like his fourth in the Welsh National.</p><p>A couple of things have gone wrong since then but there is nothing fundamentally wrong with his ability.
