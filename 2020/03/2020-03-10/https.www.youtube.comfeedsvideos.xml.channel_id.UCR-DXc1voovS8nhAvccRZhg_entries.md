In this sixth livestream, we set up an admin theme after discussing Seven and Claro. We added the Admin Toolbar module for a nicer admin UI experience. Then we copied the 'jeffgeerling' theme over from my Drupal 7 site to Drupal 8, and started updating the theme components like the .info.yml and CSS libraries to work with Drupal 8! GitHub Actions is running now, so every time we push a new commit it is tested in a CI environment, yay!
