We recently had the chance to get some hands-on time with the last character of the current Kombat Pack, and he's certainly made the transition well into Netherrealm Studios' violent and over-the-top fighting game.\n\nIn this video, we pulled together some of the greatest hits of Spawn's appearance in Mortal Kombat 11, highlighting his cinematics, fatalities, brutalities, and even his extremely elaborate fatal blow attack. Right from his intro, where you see him perched atop a church rooftop, it's clear that Spawn faithfully recreated in the fighting game. Spawn uses both conventional weapons and demonic powers, which makes his combat style a mix of ranged moves and skills that get up close and personal. His iconic chains and cape also come into play, with some grotesque results.\n\nIn addition to the new character, this next update for Mortal Kombat 11 will also introduce new Matinee-themed costumes for Jacqui Briggs, Kotal Kahn, and Erron Black inspired by pulp-adventure serials from the 1930s. Along with that, Jacqui Briggs will get another costume inspired by Spawn, giving her the appearance of a hellspawn as well.\n\nSpawn is the final character of the current Kombat Pack for Mortal Kombat 11, and he'll be available to current owners on March 17, while non-Kombat Pack owners will be able to play as him on March 24.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZRw6w2cHPE", "date_published": "2020-03-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Why Warzone Battle Royale Is A Big Move For Call Of Duty", "description": "With Modern Warfare's standalone free-to-play game, Warzone, Activision is pushing deeper into the battle royale space, and the impact for Activision could be massive. Not only that, but if successful, Warzone could potentially impact and influence the entire video game industry.\n\nIn a new video, Eddie Makuch looks into how Activision is trying to have its cake and eat it too with Warzone. Activision will continue to release big new Call of Duty games that it charges $60 for every year, on top of making even more money from Warzone (and this is to say nothing of the huge amount of money that Call of Duty: Mobile brings in every month). \n\nBut some questions remain. If Warzone sparks fire and catches on, is Activision running the risk of cannibalizing future Call of Duty games? Will Warzone's free-to-play label change how fans view the franchise? Will Activision release a new battle royale game for the franchise's yearly instalments?
