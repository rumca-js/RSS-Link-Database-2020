But obey him she nearly always did: feeding his chickens, tending his goats, typing up his manuscripts. After their marriage, the couple famously lived (like the common people!) in a cottage belonging to Orwell\u2019s aunt Nellie in Wallington, Hertfordshire, and it was within its dank walls that her husband swiftly established himself as a domestic tyrant. The house had no electricity and no indoor lavatory. Nevertheless, Eileen had to understand that the niceties were still important. Soon after the wedding, she put a jar of marmalade on the table \u2013 she was about to serve him one of his beloved cooked breakfasts \u2013 only to be instructed by Orwell that its contents should first have been decanted into a jam dish.</p><p>The difference between choice and sacrifice in a marriage is inevitably moot, particularly in the context of feminism. It\u2019s easy \u2013 too easy, sometimes \u2013 retrospectively to discount the agency of a wife, and all the more so if she was married, as Eileen was, to the kind of man who repeatedly cheated on her (once with her closest friend); who relied on her for hard labour and, sometimes, for money; and whose fantasies about proletarian life were so determinedly fixed, he would only allow his friends to drink dark ale in the pub, irrespective of what they\u2019d ordered.

As her biographer, Sylvia Topp, makes clear, moreover, her desire to be both his amanuensis and the digger of his potato patch existed alongside something far less meekly devoted. When she followed him to Spain in 1937, where he was fighting the fascists during the civil war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/05/books.artsandhumanities\" title=\"\">she had a fling with his commander, George Kopp</a>, while he was away at the front.
