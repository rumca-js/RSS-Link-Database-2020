<p>Taking the side of the oppressed has long been feminism’s raison d’etre. Amid an explosion of misogyny in public life, compassion and unity are more important than ever</p><p>I have written nothing on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gender" title="">trans issues</a> for seven years. A now-familiar row had broken out in the feminist movement back then, and I assumed that feminism would soon re-orient itself away from which body parts define a woman and whether or not the word “womxn” signified an assault on our sense of selves, and towards what I thought was obviously the more fundamental question of the movement: who has it worse? Feminism, in my life’s experience of it, takes the side of the oppressed. That is our raison d’etre.</p><p>So, anyway, I had seen this wonderful talk by Helen Belcher, who described the three ways in which trans people are portrayed and undermined, in the media and beyond. “The first is that they’re fraudulent. They’re not really who they say they are. We’d better humour them in their delusion. The second is trans as undeserving deviant. The third is trans as comedy.” Since then, this has intensified, with other, even more hostile, elements added: trans people as predators, the trans movement as deliberately poisoning the young. The savage mischief has seeped out of it. There is not much of the “We’d better humour them” any more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/10/feminist-solidarity-empowers-everyone-the-movement-must-be-trans-inclusive">Continue reading...</a>

A tall, elegant man in a crisp navy suit, he hands over a bag of guava from his garden as we sit down to talk. “When I was a child we used to hear tigers roaring in the forest around our village,” he says, over a cup of sweet milky tea. “But even in my lifetime the birds and mammals have disappeared.”</p><p>One of the seven states that make up India’s tribal north-east, Nagaland’s mountains form a jagged spine along the Indo-Myanmar border. Home to the Naga, Tibeto-Burman people made up of an estimated 70 tribes, it is part of the Indo-Burma “biodiversity hotspot”, one of 36 such regions identified globally. Ninety-two species of mammal have been documented here, as well as 490 species of butterfly, 500 species of bird and 360 species of orchid. But Thong, a local conservationist, isn’t the first person to bemoan the disappearance of wildlife.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/10/i-swapped-my-gun-for-binoculars-indias-hunters-turn-to-conservation-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We were all over each other when we dated, but in marriage we have merged our lives to the extent that I don’t really have a social life</p><p><strong>After only five years of marriage, I am finding </strong><strong>it hard to be sexually attracted to my wife</strong><strong>. When we were dating, we were all over each other, but </strong><strong>a lot has changed since we got married. Other than our sex life, w</strong><strong>e have a very good relationship</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>That said, my views on the world</strong><strong> and my personality</strong><strong> are different because of her influence. I strongly believe </strong><strong>this is for the </strong><strong>better, as she is a very sweet and caring person, but </strong><strong>could </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>explain </strong><strong>the change in sexual attraction? </strong><strong>I feel </strong><strong>as though we are </strong><strong>too co</strong><strong>sy</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>have become very alike</strong><strong>. I spend most of my time alone and talk only to her; I don’t really have a social life. </strong><strong>I don’t know how to fix this, but it is killing me</strong><strong>. I feel like less of a man and I feel bad when I am attracted to</strong><strong> other women or watch pornography. </strong></p><p>You and your wife have probably become too familial for optimum sex. Also, perhaps you are harbouring resentment about some of the changes in you that have occurred due to her influence, which could significantly affect your libido. You may need to reclaim your individuality to an extent; in doing so, you will both feel a resurgence of libido. Mutual attraction requires that each partner views the other as being separate from him or herself; if you always know what each other is thinking, the thrill and challenge of the other’s mystery is absent and the spark dies. Choose some different pastimes from your partner – and seek a different friend or two. Stand your ground in an argument. Express your true feelings with respect and clarity and don’t allow them to be dismissed. Paradoxically, good sex will return when you are more emotionally and intellectually separate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/10/i-no-longer-find-my-wife-sexually-attractive-have-we-become-too-alike">Continue reading...</a>

## Eileen: The Making of George Orwell by Sylvia Topp – review
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/10/eileen-the-making-of-george-orwell-sylvia-topp-review](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/10/eileen-the-making-of-george-orwell-sylvia-topp-review)

This life of George Orwell’s first wife, Eileen, is a dispiriting read with unconvincing arguments about her influence on his work<p>When Eileen O’Shaughnessy married George Orwell in 1936, she was 30 years old, highly educated, and knew her own mind; before the wedding, she told the minister that her vows would not include a promise to “obey” her new husband. But obey him she nearly always did: feeding his chickens, tending his goats, typing up his manuscripts. After their marriage, the couple famously lived (like the common people!) in a cottage belonging to Orwell’s aunt Nellie in Wallington, Hertfordshire, and it was within its dank walls that her husband swiftly established himself as a domestic tyrant. The house had no electricity and no indoor lavatory. Nevertheless, Eileen had to understand that the niceties were still important. Soon after the wedding, she put a jar of marmalade on the table – she was about to serve him one of his beloved cooked breakfasts – only to be instructed by Orwell that its contents should first have been decanted into a jam dish.</p><p>The difference between choice and sacrifice in a marriage is inevitably moot, particularly in the context of feminism. It’s easy – too easy, sometimes – retrospectively to discount the agency of a wife, and all the more so if she was married, as Eileen was, to the kind of man who repeatedly cheated on her (once with her closest friend); who relied on her for hard labour and, sometimes, for money; and whose fantasies about proletarian life were so determinedly fixed, he would only allow his friends to drink dark ale in the pub, irrespective of what they’d ordered. But in the case of the first Mrs Orwell – the second was the more famous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/jul/15/biography.comment" title="">Sonia</a>, who married the writer shortly before his death from tuberculosis in 1950 – there is, I think, no getting away from the fact that she knew exactly what she was doing; that some ardent part of her fully bought into his conviction that nothing mattered more than his career as a writer. As her biographer, Sylvia Topp, makes clear, moreover, her desire to be both his amanuensis and the digger of his potato patch existed alongside something far less meekly devoted. When she followed him to Spain in 1937, where he was fighting the fascists during the civil war, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/05/books.artsandhumanities" title="">she had a fling with his commander, George Kopp</a>, while he was away at the front. Other affairs would follow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/10/eileen-the-making-of-george-orwell-sylvia-topp-review">Continue reading...</a>

My kids are 12 and 10, and I work from home. What could possibly be more clement, I thought? It’ll be like having co-workers, except in pyjamas.</p><p>This was only fleeting, before the calamity kicked in. The disruption caused by mass school closures would be simply unmatched by any freak event in living memory: no flood, no ash cloud, no financial crash comes close to losing so much of the workforce to childcare, and for so long. We have some experience of multiple schools closing across a number of regions, for <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10535424/norovirus-uk-schools-hospitals-close/#:~:text=Stay%20at%20home%20if%20you,hours%20after%20symptoms%20have%20cleared." title="">norovirus</a>; that tended to be for no more than a couple of days, for deep cleaning.

<p>As the Cévennes national park celebrates its 50th anniversary, Adam Thorpe reflects on how the ‘intricate hills’ of the Massif Central protect its wildlife – and way of life</p><p>I sometimes think of the Cévennes as the massive knuckles of a sleeping green giant. Insular, tough-minded and Protestant, our home for the last 30 years has sharp granite and limestone hills that here and there stretch up out of deep valleys into proper mountains. Much of it is felted in dwarf holm oak, the evergreen and often impenetrable stuff of southern Europe, which turns metallic grey in poor weather, yet glitters beautifully under clear skies, simultaneously dark and resplendent, as difficult for a painter to capture as olive trees.</p><p>There are Alpine touches, despite its closeness to the Mediterranean: pine and spruce in dark green swathes on the higher slopes, tumbling streams among the great boulders, and the odd solitary eagle eyeing you from the level of the peaks. Beech and chestnut thrive on certain slopes, the latter providing an important income and a source of vital nourishment to the peasant Cévenol over the centuries. We gather chestnuts in season, careful to stick to those tumbled on to the paths, heeling open their spiky hulls to the nuts nestling inside like glossy cubs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/10/cevennes-national-park-rural-france-walking-massif-central">Continue reading...</a>

Adapted from Tom Perrotta’s 2017 novel, it is an unflinching coming-of-age tale – for both mother and son. <em>Ammar Kalia</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/10/tuesday-tv-tonight-mrs-fletcher-the-split">Continue reading...</a>

## 'It was just left to the people': behind a chilling documentary on the Flint water crisis

<p>British director Anthony Baxter had spent five years documenting the fallout in Flint, Michigan after a manmade disaster threatened a small community</p><p>This is, BuzzFeed News noted recently, a time when <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katherinemiller/super-tuesday-joe-biden-amy-klobuchar">“only the last 72 hours seem to matter in politics”</a>. It is the age of news as instant gratification, with goldfish-like attention spans measured out in alerts and tweets on unputdownable phones. A week can seem like a year, a year can seem like a lifetime.</p><p>So it is reassuring to consider a project such as Flint, a documentary film five years in the making. The director, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/apr/04/flint-residents-punished-poisoned-water">Anthony Baxter,</a> was holed up for long periods at the Holiday Inn Express in Flint, Michigan, capturing 400 hours of footage about one of the worst human-caused environmental disasters in American history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/09/flint-water-crisis-documentary-anthony-baxter">Continue reading...</a>

## Homeless in Heathrow: the Windrush victims still suffering two years on

<p>It has been two years since the government apologised for the scandal and promised to rectify the injustices. Yet those affected are still being failed by the Home Office - with some still destitute</p><p>It requires a military level of discipline to live most of your life in Heathrow airport. Gbolagade Ibukun-Oluwa, 59, has been homeless since 2008 and for the past five years has developed a routine that sees him spending several nights a week in the cafes just outside the departures area. He arrives between 11pm and 1am, as day staff are replaced by the night shift, rotating between a Caffè Nero in Terminal 4 and a Costa coffee shop in Terminal 5, where the workers know him and offer him a cup of hot water. If flights have been cancelled and the cafes are very busy, he takes a bus to a 24-hour McDonald’s on the airport slip road, and waits there until dawn, occasionally managing to sleep for an hour or two in his wheelchair.</p><p>In the past, Heathrow security have been hostile, calling the police, who would put him in a van and drive him beyond the airport perimeter, where they would drop him and tell him: “If we ever see you there again, you’re in big trouble.” But that aggressive approach has stopped, and mostly he is ignored by passengers and staff; at a glance he looks like any other traveller, his belongings tidily packed into a few bags. “I have a routine to arrive as late as possible and to move on as early as possible,” he says. “They don’t bother me. They’re used to people waiting all night for a flight.” For all the hassle, the airport is at least warm and safe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/10/it-felt-like-intentional-torture-the-windrush-victims-who-are-still-homeless-two-years-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The notorious case of three teenage sisters inspired a campaign for change – and a backlash from the patriarchy. By Matthew Luxmoore</p><p>At about 3pm on 27 July 2018, the day of his death, Mikhail Khachaturyan scolded his three teenage daughters, Krestina, Angelina and Maria. The apartment they shared – in a Soviet-era housing block near the huge ring road that encircles Moscow – was a mess, he told them, and they would pay for having left it that way. A large, irascible man in his late 50s with a firm Orthodox faith, Khachaturyan had run his household despotically since he allegedly forced his wife to leave in 2015.</p><p>That afternoon, his daughters would later tell investigators, he punished them in his customary sadistic way. Calling them one by one into his bedroom, he cursed and yelled at them, then pepper sprayed each one in the face. The oldest sister, Krestina, 19, began to choke from the effects of the spray. Retreating to the bedroom she shared with her sisters, Krestina collapsed on the bed and lost consciousness. Her sister Maria, then 17, the youngest of the three, would later describe this moment as “the final straw”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/khachaturyan-sisters-killing-of-abusive-father-russia-trial-family-values">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Home-workers are born survivalists. We can create a snack out of anything in the fridge if it means not having to go shopping</p><p>There’s a way of answering the phone that sounds as though you weren’t just asleep, and after nearly eight years of working from home, I’ve mastered it. The affected tone in question is one imbued with a sort of casual brightness. Timing is key. When the phone goes, you’re OK to leave it for a few rings to foster the impression that you were too busy concentrating on your work to answer immediately; snatch it up too soon and your voice will sound as though it is still steeped in half-sleep, which tends to prompt the dreaded question: “I’m sorry, did I wake you?” This question is impossible to answer in a way that is not defensive.</p><p>Since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak" title="">coronavirus outbreak</a> has led more companies to bring in home-working, some – admittedly strange – people appear to be panicking about how they are going to cope away from the office. Social media <a href="https://twitter.com/rhiannonlucyc/status/1236780027355762689" title="">abounds with well-meaning threads</a> that sound as though they were written by head girls trapped in a Kafka novella. Get dressed as though you’re going to work, they say. Try not to take naps. Make sure you go for a walk. In the absence of a boss, they have actually made themselves a schedule. These people are amateurs who have been indoctrinated by advanced capitalism, and most of them are also American (when it comes to skiving off, continental Europe must always be your model). Do not listen to them. They have internalised their own oppression.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/working-from-home-amazon-packages">Continue reading...</a>
