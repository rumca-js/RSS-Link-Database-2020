In this ninth livestream, we upgraded Drupal core from 8.8.2 to 8.8.4 using Composer. We also discussed some migration struggles with the naming of the database connection key (hint: it should be 'migrate'). Then we worked on theming the blog comments, and upgrading a template_preprocess_hook() function from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.
