In dwm and dmenu, however, there was previously added a little block of code that disallows color emojis in any case, so in order to properly see them after the fix (rather than boxes) you have to make this little change to the source code.\n\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\r\nDONATE NOW: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QkByBugq_4", "date_published": "2020-03-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA", "title": "My PERSONAL Scripts (N64 GAYMER CONFIRMED!)", "description": "We look at my personal scripts directory in this video and get a view of the optimizations I've implemented.
