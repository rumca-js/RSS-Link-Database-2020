<p>The ‘Wacko Jacko’ persona was a deliberate ruse to cover a much darker truth, says Jacques Peretti as he examines his own complicity in letting the pop star off the hook<br /></p><p>If you keep wondering what to think about Michael Jackson’s complicated legacy – is it OK to play Billie Jean at a party? Do you have to switch radio stations if Smooth Criminal comes on? – imagine how Jacques Peretti feels. He has made three films about the pop icon in the past 15 years and in this, his fourth, he aimed to build the fullest picture yet. But how many of us are brave enough to confront that picture?</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000gxf7">The Real Michael Jackson</a> (BBC Two) comes just over a year after the broadcast of HBO/Channel 4’s <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/leaving-neverland-michael-jackson-and-me/on-demand/63905-002">Leaving Neverland</a>, a gruelling, four-hour documentary built around the detailed accounts of two men, Wade Robson and James Safechuck, who say they were sexually abused by Jackson as children. Peretti’s film was initially billed as a rival Jackson film, but in the event, it’s much more like an unofficial sequel; a film that could not exist if Leaving Neverland hadn’t cleared the media’s hagiographic haze, but which also provides necessary context on the huge fallout from Jackson’s 2009 death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/30/real-michael-jackson-review-jacques-peretti">Continue reading...</a>

This means Conservative MPs considered Raab to be a worse option than both someone as pathologically untrustworthy as the Govester, and a man, in Stewart, who would soon not even be a member of the party.</p><p>Now take a deep breath, preferably not within two metres of a stranger: with Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock temporarily out of action, Raab has been the de facto leader of the country for the last five days. Or at least the politician tasked with doing all the front-of-house prime ministerial stuff. Not that we would have necessarily known, as no one can recall having seen the foreign secretary in person for more than a week. Rumour has it he had yet more unfinished body-disposal business to take care of first. Having a stand-in prime minister that looks like the serial killer in every Netflix miniseries is not altogether reassuring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/with-raab-at-the-reins-things-are-really-getting-finger-lickin-bad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jogging round the block. A bike ride in the park. An online yoga class. We must take what we can get</p><p>So, how’s quarantine going for you?

But, on a sunny morning in São Paulo, behind his aviator sunglasses and neatly trimmed moustache, he looks relaxed and content. Well he might. We are talking before the coronavirus pandemic shook the world and Scolari has been kicking back at home. “I’ve been on the beach for two months, every day,” he says. “It’s the first time I’ve been able to do that in 50 years.”</p><p>Scolari has been out of work since being sacked by Palmeiras in September and has been spending time in his native Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil’s southernmost state, to plan his next steps and mull over the last half century. There is rather a lot to reflect on. As a manager he has worked in eight countries and been to three World Cups. There was a winner’s medal in 2002 and two more semi-final appearances, the second of which we will come to later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/30/luiz-felipe-scolari-manager-teacher-brazil-england-world-cup-chelsea-ronaldinho">Continue reading...</a>

There’s a decent number of new works, too, especially among the programmes conducted by Simon Rattle, while the most recent of them is Hans Abrahamsen’s Horn Concerto, whose premiere, with the Berlin Phil’s principal horn Stefan Dohr as the immaculate soloist, is the centrepiece of a concert under Paavo Järvi. It’s framed by “fantastic” works – a rare outing for Stravinsky’s early, Rimsky-esque Scherzo Fantastique, and Berlioz’s famous symphony – and there’s an element of fantasy about the concerto, too. The horn, with its all its Romantic associations with the worlds of legend and magic, seems to be cast as the storyteller, leading the orchestra through a series of enchanted landscapes, all coloured by the fragile, intricate patterning that is a feature of Abrahamsen’s music. <em>(Digital concert hall footage is free for 30 days after registering)</em> <strong>Andrew Clements</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/30/free-opera-and-classical-for-watching-at-home-our-critics-picks-week-two">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Conservative whip whom many held responsible for Margaret Thatcher’s downfall</p><p>Tristan Garel-Jones, who has died aged 79, was a perceptive and astute member of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies" title="">Thatcher</a> government whips’ office, with such unerring political instincts that he won admiration even from his opponents in the Labour whips’ office on the other side of the members’ lobby as well as among his critics on the Conservative right- wing. The widespread belief that it was he who inspired the ruthless character of Francis Urquhart in the novel and TV series House of Cards sprang from the wit and subtlety he displayed during eight years as a whip.</p><p>But Garel-Jones also had the ability to win affection and trust. A wealthy man of great generosity, he drew his political strength from a complete lack of personal ambition for anything other than the advancement of his friends and the political causes in which he believed. Primary among the latter was the future of the European Union and, as minister of state at the Foreign Office, he was responsible for the 1993 legislation to ratify the Maastricht treaty that stoked the Tory infighting that eventually led to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/jun/23/eu-referendum-live-results-and-analysis" title="">2016 referendum</a> on withdrawal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/30/lord-garel-jones-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Relations are turning fractious as runners and pedestrians compete for dominance of the nation’s footpaths. Where will it all end?</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> Joggers.</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> Joggers or jogging?<br /><br /><strong>Joggers first: </strong>All ages, but the super-fit under-40s predominate.<br /><br /><strong>And jogging?</strong> The word, a variant of <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/shog">shogging</a> – meaning to move in a jerky manner, has been around <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/jog">since the 16th century</a>. Shakespeare uses it in The Taming of the Shrew: “You may be jogging whiles your boots are green.”<br /><br /><strong>That’s incredible. Was Shakespeare a jogger?</strong> Not as far as we know. The modern use of the term to mean running for exercise dates from the 1940s, and the idea really gathered speed after 1962 when the New Zealand athletics coach <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/arthur-lydiard-688214.html">Arthur Lydiard</a> set up the Auckland Joggers Club, which encouraged gentle long-distance running as a health benefit. The US author Jim Fixx’s 1977 book The Complete Book of Running gave the movement a huge boost, although he didn’t help the cause by dying of a heart attack while out jogging seven years later at the age of only 52.<br /><br /><strong>Still, a wonderful thing, isn’t it? I think I might go out for a jog right now to ease the boredom and get some air into my lungs. </strong>Well, if you do, be careful. There is a war raging out there.<br /><br /><strong>I thought that was just in the supermarkets. </strong>No, it’s in the nation’s parks and on its pavements and towpaths, too, where joggers – or runners, as many prefer to be called these days – and walkers are engaged in a do-or-die battle for space.<br /><strong><br />Why do joggers now prefer to be called runners?</strong> Because, as Stuart Heritage put it in a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/25/jogger-not-runner-stuart-heritage1">seminal Guardian article on the subject</a>: “Runners run because they love running. Joggers jog because they love cake.” Running is about freedom; jogging is about guilt.<br /><br /><strong>And the war? </strong>Ah yes, the war. Joggers, AKA runners, have become public enemy No 1 in the current crisis. “Public outrage is now chiefly focused on runners and joggers who have been panting along pavements and in parks, refusing to get out of the way for pedestrians in case they lose half a second off their ‘time,’” <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/uk/public-outrage-turns-to-joggers-as-london-adjusts-to-social-distancing-1.4213288">reports</a> the London correspondent of the Irish Times. Relations between runners and dog walkers are becoming <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-lockdown-give-dog-walkers-more-room-army-of-joggers-told-3bx6w6qb7">particularly fractious</a>, and Michael Gove (definitely a jogger rather than a runner) has said no run <a href="https://www.politicshome.com/news/article/michael-gove-tells-joggers-to-limit-exercise-stints-to-30-minutes-amid-coronavirus-lockdown">should exceed 30 minutes</a>.<br /><br /><strong>Where will it all end?</strong> Almost certainly with one of the combatants being bitten.<br /><br /><strong>Not to be confused with:</strong> Self-isolation, good manners or the blitz spirit.<br /><br /><strong>Do say: </strong>“Oi, don’t get so close! Who do you think you are? Mo Farah?”<br /><br /><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “But what about my marathon training?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/30/joggers-v-walkers-the-battle-for-our-pathways-during-the-coronavirus-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

Sprouting broccoli is bang in season, so all over the shops and markets right now. It is full of essential nutrients, making it perfect for feeding a nation of children who face home-schooling for the foreseeable future. Here I cut the broccoli into ribbons so it folds and disappears into the piles of similarly shaped pasta. That, and the insanely silky, cheesy sauce, should win over many a picky child and get them eating their greens.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/30/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-sprouting-broccoli-tagliatelle">Continue reading...</a>

Fabrizia Lanza, who was in charge at the school, reminded us that while it was a sensory session, not a lesson in citrus taxonomy, it was worth keeping in mind that most modern varieties are hybrids of three ancestral fruits: mandarin, pomelo and citron. We stood next to a huge table, each of the 28 varieties on one plate, one fruit cut open, the plates spread all over the table for what felt like a mad, aromatic tea party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-spaghetti-with-lemon-basil-and-breadcrumbs">Continue reading...</a>

In the 70s, Boyd married Mick Fleetwood twice, first in a stretch between 1970 and 1976, and then, for a fraught year between 1977 and 78, each resulting in feelings of loneliness, jealousy, rage and, ultimately, a total loss of identity. “If you’re going to be with someone who’s clearly an artist, who’s deeply dedicated to what they do, then you need something that <em>you’re</em> passionate about,” she said. “Otherwise, you’re just an extension of someone else’s dream. Sadly, I never felt I was creative.
