Due to a fix I've mentioned before on my channel, you can now get colored emoji and other characters in your suckless software, just install libxft-bgra (or wait until the upstream fix) and you can see them in st without crashes. In dwm and dmenu, however, there was previously added a little block of code that disallows color emojis in any case, so in order to properly see them after the fix (rather than boxes) you have to make this little change to the source code.
