The Modern Warfare 2 campaign is available now on PS4, coming later to Xbox One and PC. Here's what's included in the surprise Call of Duty remaster.

The Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered leak was real, and it's live now on PS4. The remaster revamps the original game with better visuals: that's 4K and HDR support consoles, plus an uncapped framerate and ultrawide monitor support on PC.

That said, the PC and Xbox One versions will launch on April 30. You can pre-order those or pick it up on PS4 for $19.99 / Â£19.99. Purchasing any version gets you instant access to the Underwater Team Classic Ghost Bundle, which you can learn more about in the video above.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is out now on Nintendo Switch, and it introduces a ton of exciting new features to the series, from the Island Designer--which lets you edit your town's terrain--to the ability to craft your own furniture and tools. However, there are some notable features from the series' previous entry, Animal Crossing: New Leaf for 3DS, that seem to be missing in action.

In the video above, we take a look at some Animal Crossing staples that have been conspicuously absent in New Horizons in the month that we've been playing the game so far, from beloved recurring characters like Rover and Tortimer to popular facilities like Re-Tail and Brewster's Cafe.

While we've yet to encounter these characters and features in New Horizons, that doesn't necessarily mean they've been completely cut from the game. During the recent Nintendo Direct Mini presentation, we got a brief look at New Horizons' first seasonal event, which will see Zipper T. Bunny visit your island for Bunny Day. Nintendo teased that an Earth Day event is also on the way later in the month, and it appears the flower-loving sloth Leif will return for that.

If you're just getting started in New Horizons, we've assembled a ton of different guides to help you out, from what you should be doing every day to how to make Bells fast. We also have guides on how to unlock key buildings like Nook's Cranny, how to add friends, and even how to crossbreed flowers.

P5R features 15 to 20 hours of new content, but you'll need to follow these steps in order to experience it.

Persona 5 Royal has a lot of new content that builds on the original game. However, the biggest chunk of that (the third semester and ninth palace) comes towards the end, but you'll have to do certain things throughout the course of the story to unlock all of it. This mainly consists of leveling up the new Confidants available in P5R.

The three Confidants you should rank up as soon as they're available are Akechi, Kasumi, and Maruki. As long as you take care of your relationships with them, you should be in the clear. However, there are a few things to take note of to make sure you go about it properly, mainly dates for when things happen, deadlines to rank them up, and a few tips to make things easier.

For more on Persona 5 Royal, be sure to check out our video on our experience at about 50 hours in, and stay tuned for our full review.
