Here's what's included in the surprise Call of Duty remaster.\n\nThe Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Remastered leak was real, and it's live now on PS4. The remaster revamps the original game with better visuals: that's 4K and HDR support consoles, plus an uncapped framerate and ultrawide monitor support on PC.\n\nThat said, the PC and Xbox One versions will launch on April 30. You can pre-order those or pick it up on PS4 for $19.99 / \u00a319.99. Purchasing any version gets you instant access to the Underwater Team Classic Ghost Bundle, which you can learn more about in the video above.\n\n#CallOfDuty #ModernWarfare2 #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNz0OG6sbTk", "date_published": "2020-04-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Let's Hunt For Eggs In Animal Crossing: New Horizons", "description": "Animal Crossing: New Horizons has just launched the Bunny Day event!

However, there are some notable features from the series' previous entry, Animal Crossing: New Leaf for 3DS, that seem to be missing in action.\n\nIn the video above, we take a look at some Animal Crossing staples that have been conspicuously absent in New Horizons in the month that we've been playing the game so far, from beloved recurring characters like Rover and Tortimer to popular facilities like Re-Tail and Brewster's Cafe.\n\nWhile we've yet to encounter these characters and features in New Horizons, that doesn't necessarily mean they've been completely cut from the game. During the recent Nintendo Direct Mini presentation, we got a brief look at New Horizons' first seasonal event, which will see Zipper T. Bunny visit your island for Bunny Day. Nintendo teased that an Earth Day event is also on the way later in the month, and it appears the flower-loving sloth Leif will return for that.\n\nIf you're just getting started in New Horizons, we've assembled a ton of different guides to help you out, from what you should be doing every day to how to make Bells fast. We also have guides on how to unlock key buildings like Nook's Cranny, how to add friends, and even how to crossbreed flowers.\n\n#AnimalCrossing #NewHorizons #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWILbeAELUU", "date_published": "2020-04-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Persona 5 Royal: How To Unlock The New Palace And Third Semester (Spoiler-Free)", "description": "P5R features 15 to 20 hours of new content, but you'll need to follow these steps in order to experience it.\n\nPersona 5 Royal has a lot of new content that builds on the original game. However, the biggest chunk of that (the third semester and ninth palace) comes towards the end, but you'll have to do certain things throughout the course of the story to unlock all of it. This mainly consists of leveling up the new Confidants available in P5R.\n\nThe three Confidants you should rank up as soon as they're available are Akechi, Kasumi, and Maruki. As long as you take care of your relationships with them, you should be in the clear. However, there are a few things to take note of to make sure you go about it properly, mainly dates for when things happen, deadlines to rank them up, and a few tips to make things easier.\n\nFor more on Persona 5 Royal, be sure to check out our video on our experience at about 50 hours in, and stay tuned for our full review.\n\n#Persona5Royal #HowTo #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRvkMMhV-YQ", "date_published": "2020-04-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 Campaign Remastered - Official Trailer", "description": "Relive the exhilarating classic in stunning remastered quality. \n\nPlay alongside Soap, Shepherd, Ghost and other familiar faces once again as you fight back against Vladimir Makarov, the Inner Circle, and other unforeseen foes.\n\nDownload and play now on PS4, or pre-purchase on other platforms today to play April 30th and get instant access to the free UDT Classic Ghost Bundle in Modern Warfare*.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spfO5smsfZE", "date_published": "2020-03-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Free PS4 PlayStation Plus Games For April 2020 Revealed", "description": "PS4's PlayStation Plus free games for April 2020 have been revealed.
