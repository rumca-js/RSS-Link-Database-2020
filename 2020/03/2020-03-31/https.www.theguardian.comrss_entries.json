Fragments of rock, twigs and old leaves are carried there by glaciers and streams; desert sands hitch a ride on the wind and tiny plankton die, decay and settle to the ocean floor. Last year <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GC008115\">a survey of ocean floors</a>, using seismic reflection data, revealed that the oceans contain a whopping 3.37 x 10<sup>8</sup> cubic kilometres of sediment \u2013 approximately enough to cover Earth\u2019s continents in a 2km thick layer.

But now what?</p><p>Everyone rightly sympathises with forlorn GCSE and A-level students, left in limbo when their exams were cancelled and still unsure of their path to university. But the worst hit in many ways are 18-year-old school leavers and final-year university students, due to emerge this summer into the world of work. Who will be hiring in the wake of what looks like a vertiginous crash?
