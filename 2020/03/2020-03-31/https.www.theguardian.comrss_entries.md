<p>The 30-something creators, Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, play their 13-year-old selves in a carthartic comedy that has lots of laughs but never mocks</p><p>On paper PEN15 has a gimmick, which is that the two 31-year-old writers and creators of the 10-part comedy series – Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle – play their 13-year-old selves trying to navigate middle school, amid a cast of actual teenage actors. So rapidly, however, are they subsumed into their parts that (apart from Konkle being a head taller than everyone else) it becomes unnoticeable. It’s only when you lift your head for air after each half hour of agonising immersion in their immaculately and intimately detailed pubescent world that you remember how old they are, and the collapsing of chronology makes the show’s depiction of the malevolent first stirrings of adolescence even more exquisitely painful.</p><p>We are still the children we used to be and the product of the experiences we had then and the influences that gathered around us.

## Terrawatch: plastic-rich canyons forming in the deep ocean

<p>Study suggests that 99% of the plastic arriving in the ocean is being whisked down to its far depths</p><p>The Earth’s oceans are the graveyard for almost everything eventually. Fragments of rock, twigs and old leaves are carried there by glaciers and streams; desert sands hitch a ride on the wind and tiny plankton die, decay and settle to the ocean floor. Last year <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2018GC008115">a survey of ocean floors</a>, using seismic reflection data, revealed that the oceans contain a whopping 3.37 x 10<sup>8</sup> cubic kilometres of sediment – approximately enough to cover Earth’s continents in a 2km thick layer. However, the sediment is thicker in some places than in others, and now <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.9b07527">a new study</a> shows how a very modern form of sediment – plastic – is forming plastic-rich channels on the deep ocean floor.</p><p>Using a flume tank, scientists mimicked what happens to a mix of sand and microplastic pieces when they emerge from a river mouth and enter the sea. Microplastic fragments tended to get stuck among the sand grains, and travelled with them as they fell in an avalanche off a mock ocean shelf. The results suggest that in the real world around 99% of the plastic arriving in the ocean is being whisked down to the far depths by underwater avalanches, potentially travelling thousands of kilometres across the ocean floor, and accumulating in deep sea canyons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/31/terrawatch-plastic-rich-canyons-forming-in-the-deep-ocean">Continue reading...</a>

Governors impose rigorous quarantines. The health minister urges people to stay at home, warning that unless transmission is curbed the health system will collapse by the end of April. Even drug gangs lock down favelas to stop the spread of coronavirus. Meanwhile, a citizen decries the restrictions and heads out for a stroll at a local market. Facebook and Twitter remove his posts for touting unproven remedies and attacking physical distancing. One man cannot normally cause too much damage. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/tp-captain-corona" title="">this one is the president</a>.</p><p>Jair Bolsonaro’s ascent was always frightening, and his record since taking power last year – with attacks on human rights, minorities, the arts, and destruction of the Amazon – has been shameful. His response to coronavirus has plumbed new depths. Many governments will have to answer for their mistakes and complacency when the pandemic is over.

These rules stipulate that we must have a reasonable excuse to leave our homes and that with a few exceptions, gatherings of more than two people in a public place are forbidden. The punishment for breaking the rules is either a fixed penalty notice or potentially a criminal conviction, with the police empowered to make us go home and if necessary, use force to do so. The current situation is being further complicated by discrepancies between government guidance and the letter of the law.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/people-colour-covid-19-laws-police-track-record">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From cucumber-crunchers to cranial exams, YouTube is full of ASMRtists provoking the strangely pleasurable autonomous sensory meridian response.

Others take a bar of soap and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-5P8GsdigQ">slice it methodically into tiny cubes</a>, letting the pieces clatter into a plastic tray. There are those who dress up as doctors and pretend to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjvWAdGF0S0">perform a cranial nerve exam</a>, and the ones who eat food as noisily as they can, recording every crunch and slurp in 3D stereo sound.<br /><br />To an outsider, the world of ASMR videos can be a baffling, kooky place. In a fast-growing corner of the internet, millions of people are watching each other tap, rattle, stroke and whisper their way through hours of homemade videos, with the aim of being lulled to sleep, or in the hope of experiencing “the tingles” – AKA, the <a href="https://asmruniversity.com/about-asmr/what-is-asmr/">autonomous sensory meridian response</a>.<br /><br />“It feels like a rush of champagne bubbles at the top of your head,” says curator James Taylor-Foster. “There’s a mild sense of euphoria and a feeling of deep calm.” Taylor-Foster has spent many hours trawling the weirdest depths of YouTube in preparation for a new exhibition, <a href="https://arkdes.se/en/utstallning/asmr-weird-sensation-feels-good/">Weird Sensation Feels Good</a>, at <a href="https://arkdes.se/en">ArkDes</a>, Sweden’s national centre for architecture and design, on what he sees as one of the most important creative movements to emerge from the internet.

The aisle was from Amazon, too, and so were the fairy lights strung around the chuppah. The wedding party was small: only immediate family and the rabbi. Although rain had been forecast, the weather held, and when 23-year-old student Eliana Amrami, from Chicago, married her boyfriend, 22-year-old Elliot Birn, in her parents’ garden, the sun was shining. As is customary during Jewish weddings, the bride and groom prepared to smash a glass underfoot.</p><p>Unable to attend the wedding in person due to the coronavirus shutdown, the couple’s extended family and friends had driven to neighbouring streets, and dialled into the wedding on Zoom or caught it via a YouTube live stream. Cocooned in their cars a safe distance away, they watched on smartphone screens as the couple clasped hands and stamped on the glass. As it shattered, the sound of car horns filled the air. On a laptop, elderly relatives watching the ceremony smiled and waved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/31/the-day-was-full-of-joy-and-love-how-people-are-getting-married-while-in-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

And if you have an onion and/or garlic, even better.” Sweat any alliums until they’re soft, add the ground or whole spices – if they’re on the old side, revive them first by toasting in a dry pan until aromatic – then stir in the veg, heat and, voila, a more than serviceable dish that’s ready in minutes.

To slow the spread of a virus, the government must convincingly inform and instruct the public. And to do this, it must inspire trust – trust that it is following the science, acting out of the interests of the population, and enforcing measures that will help to keep the public safe. Trust depends on transparency. If governments appear to be concealing the truth, or withholding information, their credibility can quickly crumble.</p><p>The Egyptian government has long seen transparency as a weakness, and guarded information as though it were a national security threat.

No one cares what they are wearing or who they are snogging any more; the world’s attention has been diverted by a headline-hogging pandemic.

<p>As she releases her superb fifth album, Alabama musician Katie Crutchfield shows us around her native Birmingham, and explains how sobriety opened up her songwriting</p><p>Katie Crutchfield pulls up in her dad’s rugged Jeep outside my hotel in a suburb of Birmingham, Alabama. She grins when I voice my surprise at her ride. “I should have told you it was a ragtop with crazy tyres,” she says. It’s early March, and we head to a nearby coffee shop then she steers us into the city. As soon as I take out a notebook, the bumpy ride upends my pen. “Sorry,” she says. “I love driving it so much, but it’s a little wild.”</p><p>With a licence plate repping the college football powerhouse Alabama Crimson Tide, the vehicle blends into Crutchfield’s home town. Her relationship to the place is more complex. One of the US’s sharpest and most acclaimed songwriters, she’s about to give me a tour of Birmingham as she viewed it as a teenager: through the lens of the underground punk scene. Now 31, Crutchfield about to release <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/waxahatchee-saint-cloud-review">Saint Cloud</a>, her fifth album as Waxahatchee, which finds her reexamining her southern roots with increased self-awareness. It’s one of the year’s most bewitching albums, the bristly indie rock for which she’s best known enhanced by country and folk, and the clarifying effect of new sobriety. “If you’re getting sober, you’re facing all of this stuff that has been shoved deep down and covered in booze for years,” she says. “And I’m like, oh my god, my brain is a scary place right now.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/31/waxahatchee-katie-crutchfield-getting-sober-birmingham-alabama">Continue reading...</a>

At the same time, it feels as if we’ve walked into an old recurring dream. In a way, we have. We’ve seen it before, on TV and in blockbusters. We knew roughly what it would be like, and somehow this makes the encounter not less strange, but more so.</p><p>Every day brings news of developments that, as recently as February, would have felt impossible – the work of years, not mere days.

<p>As the Australian soap reaches 35 years old, the cast and programme makers talk about the outlandish storylines, the phenomenal success and the show’s agenda of social activism <br /></p><p>On 18 March 1985, Australian TV viewers got their first glimpse of the sun-soaked cul de sac of Ramsay Street, in a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Australia. Its inhabitants were a convivial, nosy bunch particularly prone to romantic affairs and, increasingly, bouts of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/when-neighbours-jumped-the-shark">personality disorder, amnesia and violence</a>. The confines of Erinsborough provided a moral utopia – no matter how much soapy drama poured forth, the barbies, bikinis and banter would soon return.</p><p>First broadcast in the UK in October 1986 on BBC One, the show was a symbol of exotic aspirationalism amid the gloom of Thatcherite politics and the continual shuttering of industry. The teatime drama drew in 20 million viewers when Kylie Minogue (as Charlene) married Jason Donovan (Scott) in 1988.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/bouncers-dream-and-gorillagrams-an-oral-history-of-neighbours-the-worlds-silliest-sunniest-show">Continue reading...</a>
