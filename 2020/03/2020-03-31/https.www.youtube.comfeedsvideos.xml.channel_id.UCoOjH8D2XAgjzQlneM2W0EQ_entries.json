But by 2018, half of the humanity\u2019s population, around 3.4 billion people at the time, still have not experienced the golden age of information\n\nThat\u2019s where Starlink comes in. And with this system alone, Starlink could single handily bring half of the world into the modern economy\n\nPeople that live away from major metropolitan areas can afford fast internet, but they\u2019re the hardest for telecom companies to reach. Before Starlink is able to serve the ones that need internet most, it has to not go bankrupt\n\nBy 1997, owning a computer went from a far off luxury to a necessity and the Age of Information was born with plenty of money to follow.\nIf Starlink is successful, wnot only will Elon be able to get to Mars faster, but he will have inadvertently created a similar boom\n3.75b more people with money to spend online\nDouble the people to serve ads to\nDouble the people that will want an online education\nDouble the people on YouTube\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
