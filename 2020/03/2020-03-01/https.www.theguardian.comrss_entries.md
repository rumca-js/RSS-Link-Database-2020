<p>After a wait of 1,954 days, the Santiago Bernabéu saw Barcelona defeated. Through the rain they watched as Vinícius Júnior scored the goal that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/mar/01/real-madrid-barcelona-clasico-la-liga-live-el-clasico" title="">changed everything</a>: a night, that had begun nervously, and perhaps the destination of the title race too. For almost an hour they had suffered, as if awaiting the inevitable against a side seemingly sure of its superiority, but now they celebrated. At the end Marcelo slipped to his knees and the arena leapt to its feet, symbolic of what this meant.</p><p>The reaction after that first hour began with a shot from Isco, flying just over via Marc-André ter Stegen’s glove, before Vinícius gave Madrid a lead that Mariano Díaz doubled on the final whistle, as if to underline how fast things can change and Zinedine Zidane’s seemingly superhuman ability to revive footballers. Mariano had not played a single minute this season and had been on the pitch only 30 seconds but now he scored.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/01/real-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

By midday on Sunday two more vessels will have crossed from Turkey, carrying 127 Afghans to the north of the Aegean isle.</p><p>“I was really scared,” Kamaras, 34, from Sierra Leone, says, dazed and disoriented from the journey, his face covered by a surgical mask handed to him by the Greek police. “Our engine was really weak, we were in the boat for four hours and all the time I thought, what if I die,” he murmurs, raising a right hand with all five fingers missing, the price he says he has paid in torture for political opposition. “But I had spent six months in Istanbul.

## When should journalists start calling an incident an act of terror? | Elisabeth Ribbans

Readers have asked about delays in calling the Hanau tragedy a terror attack. It’s a legitimate concern, but accuracy is key<p>Just after 7am on 20 February, a reader emailed to say the Guardian had “made a massive error by calling the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/hanau-shootings" title="">Hanau</a> tragedy a shooting and not correctly calling it a terrorist attack”. At about 9pm GMT the night before, Tobias Rathjen had killed nine people at two shisha bars in Hanau, near Frankfurt, before killing his mother and then himself. “Why on earth has this not been described as a terrorist attack? To me this shows a racial bias,” wrote another reader mid-morning.</p><p>The Centre for Media Monitoring, a project of the Muslim Council of Britain, also contacted me at lunchtime over what it described as the Guardian’s initial reluctance to call the attack terrorism. “While we understand that you may have been waiting for confirmation from the authorities, there appears to be enough evidence for it to be called an act of terror,” said the CfMM’s director, Rizwana Hamid. She said that Rathjen’s manifesto revealed white supremacist views; counter-terrorism police were investigating; and Peter Beuth, the interior minister for the state of Hesse, had said federal prosecutors were treating it as an act of domestic terror.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/journalists-calling-incident-act-of-terror-hanau-readers">Continue reading...</a>

Sir Philip Rutnam’s resignation offers more evidence of this government’s reckless approach to running the country<p>One of the most striking aspects of turbulent times in British politics is the determination with which Boris Johnson’s administration appears to actively court conflict at the heart of government and beyond. In the wake of Sir Philip Rutnam’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/philip-rutnam-resignation-his-full-statement" title="">unprecedented resignation statement</a> on Saturday morning, in which the former permanent secretary to the Home Office condemned a pattern of bullying and intimidation in Whitehall, one senior ex-civil servant described the Tory leadership as modern-day Jacobins. “They used to want to preserve our great institutions,” <a href="https://twitter.com/nickmacpherson2?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" title="">tweeted Nick Macpherson</a>. “They are now hell-bent on destroying them.”</p><p>The civil service has been a prime target. Sir Philip’s decision to resign after 33 years’ service came after what he described as a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him. This was sanctioned, he believes, by his boss, the home secretary, Priti Patel, with whom he had arguments about personnel and Ms Patel’s management style. Sir Philip is now taking legal action against the government on the grounds of constructive dismissal. His statement accused Ms Patel of bullying other Home Office officials by “shouting and swearing, belittling people, making unreasonable and repeated demands”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/the-guardian-view-on-trouble-at-the-home-office-ideology-trumps-good-governance">Continue reading...</a>

## Manchester City sink Aston Villa to win third successive Carabao Cup

<p>Manchester City had no time for the romance of Aston Villa’s Carabao Cup final story. Pep Guardiola and his players deal only in the hard currency of domestic trophies and they extended their grip on it via a performance of near suffocating control.</p><p>It was important to add the qualification. Goals from Sergio Agüero and Rodri had put City in charge and, although Mbwana Samatta halved the deficit against the run of play before half-time, it looked as though Villa would be unable to fashion a shot at the equaliser, let alone score it.

<p>The way in which the Home Office’s permanent secretary quit was unprecedented, and will have far-reaching consequences</p><p>Senior officials in the civil service tend to avoid the limelight. Sometimes they emerge in front of select committees, and occasionally they give speeches or make set-piece appearances in their department. It was therefore an astonishing move for the permanent secretary of the Home Office, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/philip-rutnam-from-unflappable-civil-servant-to-priti-patel-headache" title="">Sir Philip Rutnam</a>, to hold a press conference on Saturday to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/philip-rutnam-resignation-his-full-statement" title="">announce his resignation</a>.</p><p>But the fact of Rutnam’s appearance in front of the cameras paled in comparison to what he had to say. “I regret I do not believe her,” he declared, in reference to Priti Patel’s denials that she had been involved in a briefing campaign against him. These are extraordinary words for a permanent secretary to be using about his political boss.

Turning up on the doorstep of Evelyn (Judith Jacob), whose teenage son Michael was brutally murdered 15 years ago to the day, Jackie begs her to let the past lie.

Writer best known for her biographies of Eric Gill and William Morris<p>The writer Fiona MacCarthy, who has died aged 80, believed fervently, like her adored William Morris, that design was about the power of choice – not just what to buy and use, but what to do, how to live; that actively choosing was the core of life.</p><p>In that belief, she wrote mighty biographies about outsider creators and their difficult choices. Her first major book, which calmly revealed the devout artist Eric Gill as an extreme sexual predator, was an outrageous success in 1989, yet her work most likely to last is the 1994 Morris biography, subtitled A Life for Our Time. She wrote it in <a href="https://www.davidmellordesign.com/the-round-building/" title="">the Round Building complex</a>, Hathersage, near Sheffield, the home and perfect factory that she and her partner, the industrial designer <a href="https://www.davidmellordesign.com/david-mellor-biography/" title="">David Mellor</a>, built in 1990, an exemplar of the balance of craft, domesticity and community Morris had longed for but never quite achieved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/fiona-maccarthy-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Former Uber engineer Susan Fowler has written a memoir about her fight with the company over sexism – and she hopes it will help other women in the tech industry<p>Before Susan Fowler was a whistleblower she was a violinist, and before she was a violinist she fed fruit flies to spiders that were milked for their venom at a small Arizona business known as Spider Pharm. In February 2017, Fowler was thrown into the public eye after she published a damning blogpost exposing the toxic sexism she experienced working as a software engineer at Uber. And in her new memoir, <em>Whistleblower</em>, she explains how she came to shake up one of the world’s most valuable startups. But, despite the title of her book, Fowler defies one-word labels. She is a musician, a writer, a physicist, a philosopher: a person who demands to be seen, she has written, as more than “that woman who was sexually harassed”.</p><p>Six million people read <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber" title="">Fowler’s blogpost</a> in which she chronicled her time at what was then the No 1 disrupter in Silicon Valley. In the post – titled “Reflecting On One Very, Very Strange Year At Uber” – Fowler recounted how she was pestered by her new boss on her first official day at the company. “He was in an open relationship, he said, and his girlfriend was having an easy time finding new partners but he wasn’t,” Fowler recalled. “It was clear that he was trying to get me to have sex with him.” Fowler immediately reported the conversation to HR.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/susan-fowler-uber-whistleblower-interview-travis-kalanick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Differences are becoming increasingly visible between the soft left, radical left and the orthodox left</p><p>The Labour party has always been a broad church made up of many political traditions: from trade unionists, to free marketeers, to radical socialists. With each leader the makeup of the party has changed composition, bringing in new members and shifting old alliances. The Corbyn years saw a significant sea change in Labour’s internal politics, and the current leadership election is revealing new contours to Labour’s internal topology. Most important, we’re seeing the emergence of a distinctive, radical-left current that is democratic, green and internationalist in its socialist aspirations.</p><p>Until 2015, there were <a href="http://nearfuturesonline.org/corbynism-and-its-futures/" title="">four main factional tendencies</a> in the Labour party: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labour_First" title="">“old right”</a>, the “hard left”, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/24/soft-left-labour-splinter-party" title="">“soft left”</a> and the Blairites. The old right – rooted in local government and union bureaucracies – has campaigned against radical socialism since the 1940s. The political crises of the 1980s saw the Labour left divide between the hard left of Tony Benn and the soft left led by Neil Kinnock (and, later, Ed Miliband). The soft left wanted to update socialism for a post-industrial age, to expel Trotskyist factions from the party, and to make whatever accommodations it took to win elections. The hard left remained committed to the radical policy agenda developed in the 1970s, despite waning support for traditional socialism among the electorate. The Blairites, advocating free markets and globalisation, emerged as a distinctive section of the party elite in the 1990s, but never had an enthusiastic base among members; they always relied on support from the old right and the soft left to carry out their agenda.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/01/labour-leadership-contest-new-factions">Continue reading...</a>

## Jan Morris: ‘You’re talking to someone at the very end of things’

<p>From her reporting on the first ascent of Everest to her acclaimed career as writer and historian, Jan Morris – who transitioned from male to female in the 70s – has led an extraordinary life. Now, at 93, she is publishing what may be her last book</p><p>Trefan Morys is a low 18th-century barn, stone-built, slate-roofed, topped with a weather vane and surrounded by a dense tangle of garden beneath a towering elm tree. Jan Morris has lived here, halfway up a hill in the top-left corner of Wales, with Elizabeth, once her wife, now her civil partner, for the past 30 years. Before that they had raised their four children in the big manor house a little further down the lane toward Criccieth and the coast. Like everything about Jan Morris’s long and unique life there is a kind of storytellers’ magic to Trefan Morys. Last week, I drove up through Snowdonia and down toward the Irish Sea, to listen to some of Morris’s myths and legends, while the last of storm Dennis rattled outside.</p><p>Hearing about most lives you have a sense of beginnings and middles and ends, but Morris’s 93 years resist very much in the way of this-led-to-that. It is a life that forms instead around improbable adventures a million miles from here – Morris, at 26, was the only journalist to accompany Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay on their 1953 ascent of Everest; at other times she wrote about living on Field Marshal Montgomery’s family houseboat on the Nile, and in a palazzo on the Grand Canal; she met Che Guevara in Cuba; she visited Hiroshima after the bomb, and reported on the trial of Adolf Eichmann in 1961. In her dreamy books about cities – most memorably Venice and Trieste – the world can seem a permanent Xanadu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/01/jan-morris-thinking-again-interview-youre-talking-to-someone-at-the-very-end-of-things">Continue reading...</a>

## The big picture: a dog at the wheel

<p>Martin Usborne’s expressive images capture the emotions of dogs left in cars</p><p>The photographer Martin Usborne believes the urgent idea to photograph dogs in cars came from a buried childhood memory. Aged three or four, he was left in a car in a supermarket car park; not for long, maybe a few minutes, but long enough to wonder if his parents might not come back. The feeling never left him: “In a child’s mind, it is possible to be alone for ever.”</p><p>Somehow, in his subconscious, that feeling of potential abandonment attached itself to animals. He was disturbed by the way humans might silence or confine animals, in zoos or on farms, even at home. Years later, he wanted to find a harmless way of photographing that feeling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/01/big-picture-dogs-in-cars-martin-usborne">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Focus on your marriage first – and deal with it kindly. Then decide what to do next. That’s the grown-up thing to do</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>I’m in love with my wife’s close friend. These feelings built up over four years, and when we were drunk one night, I told her</em><em>. She said she felt the same. </em><em>Months later we met and chatted, but the net result is, because of her friendship with my wife, nothing could happen. She is now in another relationship and has moved on. I understand </em><em>I’m the bad guy here, but it hurts that it’s circumstance rather than her not being interested in me.</em></p><p><em>I’m struggling. I’ve fallen totally in love and think about her every waking minute. I think she represents everything that is missing in my current marriage – the spark for me has gone. I love my wife and care about her, but ultimately don’t fancy her any more. Is this normal for a marriage of 12 years? Should I be content with a woman who loves me, or does it mean I have some sort of mental issue for not being able to move on and enjoy life?</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/01/im-in-love-with-my-wifes-best-friend-and-it-is-making-me-ill-mariella-frostrup">Continue reading...</a>
