Thanks to Subaru for partnering with us on this episode. Head to https://www.subaru.com/vehicles/outback/ to learn more about the all-new 2020 Subaru Outback.

Olympic National Park is temporarily closed as Washington, the US, and the world work to mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus. We filmed this series in early January and are currently at home practicing social distancing. We hope you and your community of friends and family are staying healthy as we work to #flattenthecurve.

Our road trip through Olympic National Park continues! This week, Stefan and Alexis are headed to Ruby Beach to find out how its famous sea stacks formed.
