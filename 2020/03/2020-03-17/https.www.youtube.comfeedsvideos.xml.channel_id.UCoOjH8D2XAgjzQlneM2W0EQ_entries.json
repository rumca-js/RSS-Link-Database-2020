That will be $140,000 and a luxury yacht\n\nBut today only around 17% of people actually trusting the government, directly taking bribes just don\u2019t work anymore\nWho cares about a few thousand dollars? You\u2019re a selfless public servant. You deserve more.\nWe need a new way to take bribes, a new way to get insider deals, without alerting the public and directly breaking any laws\n\nAs a politician, you\u2019re in the business of selling influence to those looking to buy political favors, exceptions, insider deals; and your customers whether that be a local company, or a foreign corporation or government, pays in the form of bribes\nOnce the public did catch on, they put together disclosure laws \nIf the money you\u2019re directly getting is legal, it\u2019s probably best to avoid any suspicious transactions at all cost bc why draw attention to yourself\nThere\u2019s a simple solution to this that does require more work, but it\u2019s absolutely worth it bc we\u2019re able to move hundreds of millions of dollars at a time, sometimes billions of dollars\nWe just need to borrow a simple concept from the business world called offshoring\nAs the economy becomes more global, companies use offshoring to maximize their profits\nSome offshoring is legitimate, but some companies do it to obscure their transactions\nSo we offshore our corruption\nInstead of us doing the questionable deal we move the deal and the people involved out of the country to places where there are far less disclosure laws or have our kids or close friends do the deal.\n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
