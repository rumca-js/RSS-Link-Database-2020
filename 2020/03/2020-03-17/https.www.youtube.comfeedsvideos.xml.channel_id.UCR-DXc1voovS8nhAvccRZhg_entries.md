In this seventh livestream, we mentioned the importance of coming together during the strange (and sometimes lonely!) times we live in with coronavirus and quarantines. We summarized a few things worked on between last episode and today, like a faster local development environment (trying Drupal VM, DDEV Local, and Symfony Local Server too!). We also ran through some pragmatic choices with regard to switching modules in Drupal 8 (and why I chose to stick with the older but working code filter module). Finally, we spent a half an hour working on making blog posts look the same on the Drupal 8 site as the Drupal 7 site.
