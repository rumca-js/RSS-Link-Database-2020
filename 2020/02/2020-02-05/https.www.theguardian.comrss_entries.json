But Kramer vs Kramer just converts its rage and sadness into more rage and more sadness. In Heartburn, Ephron alchemised her anger and grief into something extremely funny, honest and vulnerable. Baumbach does the same with Marriage Story, which tells the story of the collapse of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole\u2019s (Scarlett Johansson) marriage. But Baumbach goes one step further, something you almost never see in any movie, let alone one about divorce: he looks at both the man and the woman\u2019s experiences. (In fact, the only movie I can think of that is equally interested in its male and female protagonists is When Harry Met Sally, which was written by \u2026 Nora Ephron.)</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/05/why-marriage-story-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/05/why-marriage-story-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar", "date_published": "2020-02-05 06:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Only rebel Tories can restore power and sovereignty to parliament now | Rafael Behr", "description": "<p>The opposition will vote impotently against whatever Johnson proposes.
