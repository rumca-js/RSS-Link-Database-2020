<p>Scotland host England on Saturday but whatever the result at Murrayfield it is unlikely to match the fervour of their famous win 30 years ago</p><p>Even now, 30 years on, memories of Scotland’s tumultuous 1990 grand-slam triumph over England have the power to move those involved to tears. Iwan Tukalo is recounting the team talk delivered by Scotland’s revered coaching double-act of Ian McGeechan and Jim Telfer at their hotel before heading to Murrayfield. It was, he believes, the “defining moment” when hope was infused with conviction they could topple Will Carling’s England and seize European rugby’s biggest prize themselves.</p><p>“Normally it was a little bit like being back at school, with the teachers – the coaches – at the front and then our chairs set out in rows,” the former wing says. “This time all the seats were in a circle and on the front of each chair was a jersey but you couldn’t see the numbers, just the thistle. They said: ‘Come in, just sit anywhere.’</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/05/scotland-england-1990-grand-slam-rmurrayfield-six-nations-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tottenham’s motivation in hiring José Mourinho to replace Mauricio Pochettino was clear. They wanted the serial winner to guide them to silverware which, despite Pochettino’s excellence, has consistently eluded them. The drought pre-dated the Argentinian. Since the 1984 Uefa Cup, the club have won only three major trophies.</p><p>Mourinho has viewed this season’s FA Cup through the prism of opportunity.

## Impeachment didn't remove Trump. But what if elections won't either? | Lawrence Douglas

<p>A Democratic victory on election day should free us from the chaos of the Trump presidency. But that is far from guaranteed</p><p>By all measures, the president was a malicious demagogue with a “taste for public performance”, reviled for his “swaggering vanity”. Many considered him incompetent and unfit for office; some called him mad. He impugned the character of the country’s most famous war hero but was, himself, “exquisitely sensitive to slights, real or perceived”. He inflamed racial tensions and embraced the cause of white supremacists. He liked to “humiliate, harass, and hound” his enemies, real and imagined. Heedless of consequences, he “baited Congress and bullied men, believing his enemies were enemies of the people”. A leading senator lamented that “he has introduced the most fearful system of corruption and demoralization into any government in modern history”. The hostilities between Congress and the president became so great that impeachment was all but inevitable.</p><p>Sound familiar? Yet much as this may sound like a portrait of the current inhabitant of the White House, it is in fact Brenda Wineapple’s description of Andrew Johnson in her immensely readable book, The Impeachers: The Trial of Andrew Johnson and the Dream of a Just Nation<em>. </em>Johnson, as we recall, was the first president in American history to be impeached, and like Donald Trump survived removal by the Senate – in Johnson’s case, by a single vote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/trump-impeachment-acquittal-2020-election">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on HS2: let the train take the strain | Editorial
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-hs2-let-the-train-take-the-strain](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-hs2-let-the-train-take-the-strain)

<p>HS2 is well behind schedule and over budget. It can only work as part of an integrated transport plan designed to cut carbon</p><p>“When in a hole, stop digging” is an iron law of politics, but not one that Boris Johnson recognises. He made his name by flouting conventional wisdom and gives the impression there’s no reason to stop. In the case of High Speed 2 – a railway where costs have doubled to around £100bn – he joked to schoolchildren last week that with a hole this big “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/31/boris-johnson-hs2-keep-digging" title="">the only thing to do is keep digging</a>”. Yet Mr Johnson knows the arguments are finely balanced: between those who claim the scheme will be an economic boost for a country far too reliant on the south-east and highly polluting forms of travel, against those who say it is not the most cost-effective or the greenest solution to the problems it is intended to solve.</p><p>Mr Johnson has yet to make a convincing case for proceeding with the project – which his chief adviser calls a “<a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7381615/Boris-Johnsons-aide-Dominic-Cummings-called-HS2-disaster-zone.html" title="">disaster zone</a>”. Instead the prime minister has hidden behind a review that he launched last August and leaks suggesting that Douglas Oakervee, the former HS2 chairman reporting to Mr Johnson, strongly “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51319261" title="">advised against cancelling the project</a>”. There’s no doubt HS2 has been mismanaged and is well behind schedule and over budget. More than £7bn has been sunk into the project. The first trains were supposed to run by 2026 but won’t pull out of stations <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2019-09-03/HCWS1809/" title="">before 2028</a>. The project’s objectives are pretty clear: to increase capacity on the railway to meet long-term demand; to rebalance the economy by stimulating growth in the north of England; and to do both of these things in the most environmentally sustainable way possible. But is HS2 the answer to the questions raised? Or would a better reply be to scrap it and start with something else?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/the-guardian-view-on-hs2-let-the-train-take-the-strain">Continue reading...</a>

Barcelona are in a mess and Eric Abidal’s comments that the players were to blame was simply too much for the Argentinian<p>Quique Setién scoffed and then started laughing. “No way,” he said. He had been talking for 12 minutes and he was only halfway through, still trying to put out the fire, when he was asked if he regretted becoming the Barcelona manager. “It’s true that a month ago I was at home and I had no problems, but [these are] blessed problems. I have the same enthusiasm as ever, the same will, because my life hasn’t been easy. You know things will happen here, you know the repercussions will be huge, but I’m blown by the north wind; I don’t go down easily.”</p><p>Nobody said it was easy, but nobody said it would be this hard. As for the problems, there are a lot. “It’s not normal to take over at a team that’s top,” Setién said when he arrived on 13 January but nor is it normal for so many things to happen so fast. And the scale of the latest problem – his captain and best player <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/04/barcelona-meltdown-lionel-messi-eric-abidal" title="">publicly calling out the sporting director</a> – is yet to be fully gauged.

<p>These oat, date and chocolate energy balls do not contain unnecessary fat, so tick all the right boxes for a pre-gym snack</p><p>There are endless variations on date-based energy snacks, but I think this version ticks all the right boxes for a pre-gym snack. Unlike others, these balls do not contain unnecessary fat through the addition of ground nuts, but the main difference is that they are not too sticky. Most energy snacks use the dates to bind the other ingredients together. They are rich, caramelly and chewy, but they can also be a bit grainy and sticky. These energy balls are smooth and glossy due to the emulsifying effect of the melted dark chocolate. More importantly, they give you theobromine, a stimulant similar to caffeine and abundant in chocolate that has a high cocoa-solids content. I credit the dark chocolate with giving me that second wind to carry me to the gym after work.</p><p><em>Makes 9 or 10 balls</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/05/david-athertons-recipe-for-banana-energy-balls">Continue reading...</a>

It was 2015 and Berrington was told in writing that there would be some nudity, which she was OK with in principle, as long as all the details were straightened out in advance.</p><p>But she says alarm bells began ringing when Poliakoff wouldn’t agree to contractually stipulate the exact requirements of Berrington’s nude scenes before filming began. However, Berrington was optimistic they’d be able to work something out, so she requested a phone call with Poliakoff. When they spoke, Berrington asked him how long she’d be nude for, what the lighting would be like and whether she’d be able to choose which specific parts of her body would be seen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/05/horror-stories-how-to-shoot-ethical-sex-scene-ruth-wilson-affair-emilia-clarke-game-of-thrones">Continue reading...</a>

Survivors face returning to their abuser or sleeping rough as they can’t prove they are vulnerable to council housing officers<p>Sara Mayer’s youngest child often asks: “Mum, how many days will we stay here?” Each time, she tells him they won’t have to move again, but so far she has been unable to keep her promise.

The family moved and tried to settle somewhere new, but time and again he tracked them down.</p><p>In 2018, he locked himself in the house with his teenage daughter, who only escaped when Mayer arrived with the police.

<p>As well as green credentials, the Bristol Wing has a strong community ethos, providing rooms for young homeless people alongside paying guests </p><p>Not so many years ago, arriving on a Friday night at Bridewell Street in the centre of Bristol (better known as The Bridewell) might have meant a night in the cells. Until 2005, this cluster of Grade II-listed buildings housed a police headquarters, police station and law courts, as well as a fire station. Since then it has been many things, including a graffiti gallery and a circus space – I have dim memories of coming to a rave here, once – and now it’s home to the <a href="https://thebristolwing.co.uk/" title="">Bristol Wing</a>, a new boutique hostel with a social conscience.</p><p>Passing through a doorway engraved with the words Bristol Police Headquarters, my partner and I found ourselves in a stately 1920s foyer with forest-green walls, a black-and-white tiled floor and a restored cage lift: it’s a bit like a scene from Wes Anderson’s The Grand Budapest Hotel. It would be tempting to describe this as a sanctuary from the streets outside, but that would miss the point. Along with its green credentials (wood-fibre insulation, solar panels and bird boxes on the roof), this hostel, opened in January 2018, provides nine single bedrooms for young homeless people every night, as well as one-to-one support, subsidised by fees from the commercial rooms and dorms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/05/bristols-old-police-headquarters-is-now-a-boutique-hostel-with-a-social-conscience">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ian Shaw plays his actor father in West End play about the troubled production of Spielberg’s first blockbuster </p><p>When Robert Shaw was filming the blockbuster Jaws, the actor’s young son came to visit with the hope of seeing the famous mechanical shark named Bruce. “He was strictly under wraps,” recalls Ian Shaw. “I was let in and someone pulled off the dust cover.” How did he feel when he came face to face with the sharp-toothed Bruce? “It scared me,” he admits. “It was certainly frightening, even out of the water.”</p><p>Forty-five years later, he is portraying his father in a play about the famously beleaguered Jaws shoot. The Shark Is Broken, co-written by Ian Shaw and Joseph Nixon, was a hit at the Edinburgh festival last summer and will open in London’s West End in May, directed by Guy Masterson and presented by Sonia Friedman Productions. It is a three-hander following Robert Shaw and his fellow actors <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/12/obituaries.usa">Roy Scheider</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/24/richard-dreyfuss-reckless-when-i-die-i-want-the-chance-to-hit-god-in-the-face">Richard Dreyfuss</a>, who are “stuck together on a boat waiting to film” as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/31/jaws-40-years-on-truly-great-lasting-classics-of-america-cinema">Steven Spielberg’s movie</a> goes wildly over budget and over schedule on location in Martha’s Vineyard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/05/robert-shaw-son-play-jaws-fractious-shoot-spielberg-the-shark-is-broken">Continue reading...</a>

## Dawn choruses: are these the best five songs to wake up to?

<p>Scientists have found that upbeat music, rather than the shrill beep of an alarm clock, is the best way to rise and shine. But which tunes should you try?</p><p>As if life isn’t enough of a slog, every morning millions of us are yanked out of sleep by the shrill beep of an alarm, only to hit snooze groggily and relive the torture nine minutes later. If you have ever found yourself thinking that there must be a better way to live than this, you might be right. Over at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, scientists have been busy s<a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/news/all-news/2020/feb/melodic-alarms" title="">tudying the best way</a> to drag yourself into the light of a new day – and it turns out that music is the way to go. Waking up to a gently melodic, upbeat song gets the synapses firing or, as they put it, helps you to “transition to a waking state in a more effective way”.</p><p>So what songs should you switch your alarm to? There are a couple of obvious contenders, but don’t be fooled: the Boo Radleys’ song Wake Up Boo! has the words “wake up” in it, but that is no reason to subject yourself to it first thing in the morning; and while the first 20 plays of Sonny and Cher’s I Got You Babe may be OK, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day, you will eventually hate waking up to this song so much you will want to kidnap a groundhog and drive it off a cliff. Instead, say goodbye to grogginess and hello to a whole new you with these failsafe alarm alternatives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/feb/05/dawn-choruses-are-these-the-best-five-songs-to-wake-up-to">Continue reading...</a>

## Why Marriage Story should win the best picture Oscar

<p>Noah Baumbach’s film about divorce, starring Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, is unique: it is simultaneously sad and funny, mean and hilarious </p><p>‘I knew the moment my marriage ended that someday it might make a book – if I could just stop crying about it. One of the things I’m proudest of is that I managed to convert an event that seemed to me hideously tragic at the time to a comedy – and if that’s not fiction I don’t know what is.”</p><p>This is what Nora Ephron wrote on the 25th anniversary of the publication of her classic novel, Heartburn, which was inspired by her divorce from the journalist Carl Bernstein. It’s a quote that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/noah-baumbach-marriage-story-divorce-hope">Noah Baumbach</a> would be more than entitled to slap on at the beginning of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/17/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-noah-baumbach-best-film-yet">Marriage Story</a>, a film that was inspired by his divorce from actor Jennifer Jason Leigh. For some reason, people (fools) keep comparing Baumbach’s movie to <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2016/03/meryl-streep-kramer-vs-kramer-oscar">Kramer vs Kramer</a>, the 1979 anti-feminist divorce movie starring Dustin Hoffman and Meryl Streep. But Kramer vs Kramer just converts its rage and sadness into more rage and more sadness. In Heartburn, Ephron alchemised her anger and grief into something extremely funny, honest and vulnerable. Baumbach does the same with Marriage Story, which tells the story of the collapse of Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole’s (Scarlett Johansson) marriage. But Baumbach goes one step further, something you almost never see in any movie, let alone one about divorce: he looks at both the man and the woman’s experiences. (In fact, the only movie I can think of that is equally interested in its male and female protagonists is When Harry Met Sally, which was written by … Nora Ephron.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/05/why-marriage-story-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The opposition will vote impotently against whatever Johnson proposes. So the salient question is: what might cause a revolt?</p><p>Conscience and parliament are two forces to constrain a prime minister, and Boris Johnson is troubled by neither. There have been leaders without scruple and ruling parties with large majorities before, but it is a while since Britain felt the combination. It will take some adjustment after the hung parliament years, when government had to scrimp for votes to legislate. That situation flattered opposition parties who felt their hands on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/mar/12/mps-ignore-mays-pleas-and-defeat-her-brexit-deal-by-149-votes" title="">lever of power</a>, albeit only to obstruct.</p><p>A majority of 80 takes the heat off Johnson to satisfy anyone but himself. He has already done the only thing most people will remember from his election manifesto: Britain has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/31/brexit-day-britain-prepares-leave-eu-live-news-updates" title="">left the European Union</a>. He can treat stray pledges left over from the campaign as disposable. The Tory leader’s record shows no fear of being caught in a blatant lie, and his supporters’ record of indulgence justifies that confidence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/05/rebel-tories-sovereignty-parliment-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>
