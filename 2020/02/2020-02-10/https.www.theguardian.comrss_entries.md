## Running reaches crossroads as Nike-led footwear arms race infects mainstream | Jonathan Liew

<p>From Olympic and world records down to parkruns, Vaporfly’s sole technology thrives at the expense of a sport’s soul</p><p>There was a guy at parkrun the weekend before last wearing a pair of lime-green Vaporflys on the start line. At least he looked suitably sheepish about it – pointedly ignoring the sharp whispers, the discreet pointing, the gentle ribbing from his running club mates. With its clownish platform heels and lurid alien colour scheme, the Vaporfly is not a shoe for blending into the crowd. Even in a field of 600 anonymous runners the eye is always going to be drawn to the one wearing what looks like a mutant tropical fish on each foot. The race began and off he streaked: a blur of lime-green disappearing into the distance, leaving the rest of us, with our boring reasonably-priced shoes and sniggering moral judgments, in his dust.</p><p>Of course, it’s easy to scoff when the stakes are minuscule. Turning up for your local Saturday morning fun run in £250 space-age trainers: objectively very funny, and largely analogous to the guy who wears his Lionel Messi astro boots to Wednesday five-a-side (and leaves with several painful stud-shaped indentations in his ankle). What happens, though, when the stakes are far higher? When the prize is an Olympic gold medal, when the audience is global, when the margins are life-changing? Should it matter what shoes the competitors are wearing? And if not, why not?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/10/running-crossroads-nike-vaporfly-footwear-arms-race-mainstream">Continue reading...</a>

## Everton show the way by promoting community rather gambling | David Conn

If Premier League clubs want recognition for work off the pitch, then rejecting sponsorship from bookies is the way forward<p>In a climate of serious concern finally rising about football’s drenching with gambling adverts, Everton showed a glimpse of a better future at their home match with Crystal Palace on Saturday. Rather than promoting to the watching world Everton’s sponsor, the Kenyan betting giant SportPesa, the players wore a name across their shirts that looked very much more appropriate for the self-styled “people’s club”: their own Everton in the Community programme.</p><p>It was a one-off, Everton taking advantage of the single match a season when clubs generally can promote a good cause rather than their commercial sponsor, which, for 10 of the 20 Premier League clubs, is an online gambling company. Palace were wearing the name of theirs, ManBetX, reported to be a Filipino-owned sports betting and casino outfit, operated by a company registered in Malta.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/10/everton-community-gambling-sponsorship-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Seeing fans and family gather in Kingston to celebrate the late musician’s 75th birthday, music writer Vivien Goldman reflects on his indelible legacy</p><p>At 7am on 6 February, on what would have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobmarley">Bob Marley</a>’s 75th birthday, the abeng conch shell blows at his old home at uptown Kingston’s 56 Hope Road – now the Bob Marley museum – as it did in the days of the long-gone indigenous Taino tribe, and later as a call to slave uprisings on the plantation.</p><p>Today, the museum is the Jamaican capital’s hottest tourist ticket, drawing more than 60,000 visitors a year. But in the turbulent 1970s, when the downtown area was torn between superpower ideologies and their local paymasters, it was audacious of Marley to insert his ragtag “ghetto star” Rasta crew into Hope Road – also home to Jamaica’s prime minister – a process he described to me in the 1970s as “bringing the ghetto uptown”. He hoped to make a safe space for the gangs of youth who were controlled on their home turf by opposing political forces: it worked, at least until <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/16/urban.worldmusic">gunmen tried to kill him there in 1976</a>.

<p>These ‘ugly but good’ brittle cookies make an attractive pairing with all kinds of soft puddings, or just eat them on their own with a cuppa</p><p><em>Brutti ma buoni</em>, or “ugly but good”, is the name of this week’s recipe: hazelnut and egg white biscuits. Like many edible things, their origins are disputed; it seems likely that the biscuits originated in Prato, a city and commune in Tuscany where they are also known as <em>mandorlati di San Clemente</em>. Wherever they originated, <em>brutti ma buoni</em> have migrated all over Italy and are now found in pretty much every bakery next to the soft almond biscuits, the biscuits made with wine (to dip in wine) and wisp-thin cat’s tongues.</p><p>Quite how ugly the biscuits are depends on the bakery, and the beholder. Our local makes brutti ma buoni – and there is no getting around this – that look like neat mounds of poo. I am amused every time I see them, which is every day.

<p><strong>Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff</strong><br />Conductor Carlo Rizzi and Welsh National Opera’s chorus and orchestra give the ear much to savour, but the voices disappoint in David Pountney’s new production </p><p>Giuseppe Verdi’s determination to conquer Paris with a grand opera that fulfilled the requisites of French convention just about paid off: its first performance in 1855 was a modest success. Grand and, at three-and-a-half hours, a long haul, Les Vêpres Siciliennes requires a parallel determination on the part of today’s audience – not least in getting to grips with a story rooted in an actual historical event: the massacre of Sicilians by their French oppressors in 1282. But Verdi is core to the Welsh National Opera’s tradition and with this production – the last in the trilogy undertaken over three seasons by director David Pountney and conductor laureate <a href="http://carlorizzi.com/">Carlo Rizzi</a> – they honour his intentions nobly.</p><p>Insisting on the composer’s advances in creating musical drama that’s both imposing and intimate, Pountney and Rizzi also uphold the integrity of the French operatic experience that demanded ballet as part of the opera, by involving National Dance Company Wales. Rather than interpolated as mere divertissement, their dances – contemporary rather than balletic in style – enact the backstory of Sicilian freedom-fighter Henri, conceived when his mother is raped by Guy de Montfort, the Frenchman who becomes the island’s brutal governor. Learning that this man is his father appals Henri, and it is the confrontation of the two men, the collision of agonising political and emotional considerations, that Verdi conjures most brilliantly. It is indeed in their central duet and those between Henri and his beloved Hélène that the music is at its most intense; together with highly charged choruses, the WNO forces are here at their customary best.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/10/les-vepres-siciliennes-review-wales-millennium-centre-cardiff-verdi-welsh-national-opera">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Birds of Prey to Wonder Woman 1984, superhero blockbusters are ditching gloomy realism for gold and neon</p><p>A new, more colourful era of comic-book movies beckons this year, with a slate of movies centred on female superheroes and directed by women, including DC’s Birds of Prey and Wonder Woman 1984, and Marvel’s Black Widow and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/24/game-of-thrones-star-kit-harington-joins-marvels-the-eternals">Eternals</a>. But it is not just a change of perspective; things are literally getting more colourful.</p><p>Just check out the trailer for Birds of Prey: compared to its gloom-laden DC predecessors, it is a riot of colour. Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn sets the tone, from her pink-and-blue bunches to her neon pink-and-gold wardrobe. And that brightness is carried through to the locations, the accessories, the lighting, the set-pieces (a Gentlemen Prefer Blondes homage). Even the explosions are more colourful. It is ostensibly set in the same shadowy Gotham City that Batman and co skulk through, but visually it is a different universe. It is a reminder that, for all their spectacular success, comic-book movies have often been dull as ditchwater to look at.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/neon-demons-why-comic-book-movies-are-replacing-grey-with-vibrant-colour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Black and minority ethnic people are more likely to develop mental health conditions but less likely to access counselling – or find it fit for purpose. Are more BME therapists the answer?</p><p>When Sana, then a student in London hailing from Coventry, was 20 years old, she was referred to a psychotherapist. Her father had died and, miles away from home, she had begun to spiral into a depression. She became withdrawn and would lock herself away in her bedroom. Eventually, her friends persuaded her to seek help.</p><p>“It had got to the point where I was basically paralysed and I needed some kind of escape,” she recalls. “There was no other way out … I forced myself to go to the doctor.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/10/therapy-failing-bme-patients-mental-health-counselling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brighton still searching for right system, Richarlison is showing his class and ruthless Nottingham Forest have the momentum</p><p>Brighton have been chopping and changing, looking for a formula that might help them beat the drop. They remain outside the relegation zone by three points and have a better goal difference than their rivals. But they have not won since December and, ever since, the team has gone through a number of permutations from 3-5-2 to 4-4-2 and others in between. On Saturday they started in a 4-1-4-1 with Davy Pröpper anchoring midfield behind Aaron Mooy and Pascal Gross. By the time the game ended there were two up top and two wide midfielders at full-back. In the end it worked, with one substitute, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, firing over the cross that Adrian Mariappa turned into his own net for Brighton’s equaliser. But it was a close-run thing. Brighton are still looking for an approach they can rely on. They will need to settle on one soon. <strong>Paul MacInnes</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/10/premier-league-champiosnhip-europe-talking-points">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wales’s fabled ability to recover from defeat will be tested by France while England need to start taking the initiative earlier</p><p>Wayne Pivac suffered his first defeat, but while the greater emphasis he places on attack was evident in the off-loads and running angles the Six Nations champions indulged in when they managed to generate quick ball, they came a distant second physically. It could be seen as a vindication of Warren Gatland’s insistence that ambition to play a wide game matters little if the gainline battle is lost, but he watched similar defeats in Dublin two years ago and in 2014 when they were pounded into submission. Wales under Gatland tended to recover quickly from a setback and with France at home in the next round, it will be an early indicator for the new regime of how much they have preserved. <strong>Paul Rees</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/10/six-nations-talking-points-stormy-second-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m in doubt because one of them has a help to buy Isa and this may disqualify her as a first-time buyer</p><p><strong>Q</strong> I am in a dilemma as to what to do with an inherited property. My first thoughts were to sign the property jointly over to my two daughters. However, one of them has a help to buy Isa and has been told that if she already owns property (albeit gifted to her), she would not be eligible as a first time buyer. Is this correct?<br /><strong>DS</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> Yes that is correct. And no longer counting as a first-time buyer would mean that she was no longer eligible to claim the help to buy Isa* bonus paid on the completion on the purchase of a first-time home. More expensively, transferring inherited property to your daughter would mean that she (and possibly her sister if she is also a potential first-time buyer) would no longer qualify for zero stamp duty land tax on the first £300,000 of a first-time home costing up to £500,000; the amount over £300,000 and up to £500,000 would be charged at 5%.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/10/should-i-sign-over-inherited-property-to-my-daughters">Continue reading...</a>

Those who lobby against the corporation’s service remit fail to understand its unique relationship with its audience<p>‘‘You’re mistaken if you think you can hand Margaret Thatcher a pearl-handled revolver and expect her to do the right thing. She’d shoot you with it.” As memory serves me, those were the words of a member of parliament being interviewed on the BBC World Service in November 1990. The programme was Newshour, and the presenter was Owen Bennett-Jones. I recall these details because the ousting of Thatcher was the first political event I tuned into properly as a child with an interest in politics living in a sub-Saharan African country with no access to media that covered current events.</p><p>Satellite dishes were prohibitively expensive, and apart from a short news bulletin on state-controlled TV there was no other source of news, let alone analysis – until I found the BBC World Service on shortwave radio. I started to haul the only portable radio in the house, a large battery-powered contraption with a long-bent aerial, everywhere I went, becoming aware of the dead zones in the house where the signal was weak, and making note of the times when the signal was strongest. Night-times were the worst. I would heave the radio into the bed and painstakingly tease the dial to find the crackling transmission from Bush House, able only to fall asleep when I managed to find the faint voices fading in and out of the crackle of white noise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/10/bbc-public-value-audiences">Continue reading...</a>

## Austerity is grinding on – it has cut too deep to ‘level up’ | John Harris

Much of what has closed is not coming back</p><p>Seven years ago, pretty much to the week, I paid my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/04/newcastle-cold-fear-little-sense-of-hope" title="">first visit as a journalist</a> to Newcastle upon Tyne. The ostensible reason was a fuss about the city council’s proposal to cut its arts budget to zero, and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/16/newcastle-arts-cuts-disastrous-stars" title="">campaign of opposition</a> endorsed by such alumni of the city as Bryan Ferry and Gordon “Sting” Sumner. But that controversy was only a small, distracting aspect of a much bigger story: the fact that the coalition government’s austerity was now threatening some of the most basic parts of Newcastle’s social fabric, as councillors faced cuts of around £100m, spread over three years. Then as now, they were led by Nick Forbes, the imaginative, engaging politician who remains in post, and is these days also the leader of the Local Government Association’s Labour group, which represents councillors from across England and Wales, and had its annual conference at the weekend.</p><p>£37m was cut in 2013-14, followed by £38m, then £40m and so on, until the council had lost £300m by the end of 2019</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/10/austerity-level-up-newcastle-budget-cuts">Continue reading...</a>

The plan was to discuss his new book, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/i-love-the-bones-of-you-9781471176319.html" title="">I Love the Bones of You</a>, which is part autobiography and part moving tribute to his father, Ronnie, who died in 2012 following a long period with dementia. But then word reached us that the actor was keen not to dwell on that; was there anything else we might like him to talk about?</p><p>It is unusual for a celebrity to want to discuss anything <em>other</em> than the thing they were promoting. But it turns out Eccleston had his reasons for changing the subject. His book focuses heavily on his previously undisclosed struggle with anorexia and a mental breakdown so intense that the Priory psychiatrist Justin Haslam described it as one of the worst cases of clinical depression he had ever seen. Eccleston, 55, found it easy enough to write his account of the trauma, but the subsequent task of promoting it was far tougher than he had expected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/10/christopher-eccleston-felt-was-going-to-die-depression-anorexia-books">Continue reading...</a>

Remodelling our lives around creativity and participation will ease the transition that the climate crisis demands<p>Can we fully absorb the scale of the climate crisis without becoming paralysed by fear? This is a big question, with more than one answer. But it helps, I think, to recognise the extent of the challenge to our imaginations. The Indian writers Arundhati Roy and Amitav Ghosh have expressed this best. Roy used the image of a mountain filled with valuable bauxite to ask whether we could ever care enough about our environment to leave resources in the ground. Last year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/31/arundhati-roy-novelist-god-small-things-activism" title="">she spelled out </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/31/arundhati-roy-novelist-god-small-things-activism" title="">her belief </a>that the answer goes beyond politics, since what is needed is an “imagination that neither the left or the right has. To decide how you’re going to manage without” the wealth derived from mineral resources.</p><p>Ghosh’s book The Great Derangement argues that humanity’s alienation from nature is a delusion more than two centuries in the making – and one that writers and artists have proved as unable to resist as everyone else. “Let us make no mistake,” he writes, “the climate crisis is also a crisis of culture, and thus of the imagination.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/10/everyday-arts-low-carbon-creativity-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>
