Ahead of the start of System Override Collection, learn about all the in-game changes and content coming in the Apex Legends limited-time event--including the new Deja Loot mode, Evo Shield, legendary skins, and Octane heirloom.

 

Respawn has announced the next limited-time event for Apex Legends is coming March 3. It's called System Override, and will offer plenty of new content--some of which will stick around but most of which will be gone after two weeks. Keep watching to learn everything you need to know about what's coming in System Override.

Let's start with the limited-time stuff. During System Override, you'll have access to a new mode called Deja Loot. Though the drop ship path and ring closure pattern will change day-to-day in the new mode, loot placement won't. The loot spawn is permanently set during Deja Loot.

So if you happen to find a perfectly outfitted Triple-Take somewhere, you can rest easy knowing that same Triple-Take will spawn in that exact spot for every match you play. Just don't rest too easy--chances are if you know where all the best loot will spawn, your opponents will too. Deja Loot will take place on World's Edge during the first week of System Override before transitioning to Kings Canyon for the second week.

In Deja Loot, you'll also find a brand-new piece of armor: the Evo Shield. This glowing body shield starts out weaker than a common white one, but damaging enemies will allow it to grow stronger. At max strength, the Evo Shield surpasses an epic purple body shield--rivaling a legendary gold one.

Respawn has said the Evo Shield will remain exclusive to Deja Loot for now, but the team will consider adding the armor to the main game based on player feedback.

System Override presents plenty of limited-time cosmetics to earn too. Complete in-game challenges and you'll move up in the Prize Track, allowing you to unlock rewards. There are also 24 themed, limited-time cosmetics that you can purchase through Apex Coins or Crafting Materials or earn through special Apex Packs. Nab all 24 and you'll earn Octane's heirloom: a butterfly knife that also acts as a Stim syringe.

Permanent changes will be made in System Override too. Do you want one of those cool-looking character heirlooms, but you're scared that the RNG gods will curse you with the exact one you don't want? Once System Override starts, you don't have to worry about that.

Instead of randomly earning an heirloom from opening Apex Packs, players will instead earn heirloom shards. With these shards, you can construct whichever heirloom you want, whether you want Wraith, Bloodhound, Lifeline, or Pathfinder. Once System Override ends, the Octane heirloom will be added to the pool too. This heirloom system will stick around even after System Override ends.

And that's everything there is to know about System Override ahead of the event. Are you excited to see Kings Canyon return once again? Are you curious as to the effectiveness of the Evo Shield? Let us know in the comments section below.

Media Molecule's long-awaited PlayStation 4 exclusive Dreams is finally here. Dreams is more than a game, however, as it's really a game and a game-making tool. Creators have already built some amazing things with Dreams, and this includes some creepy and bizarre horror games.

In a new video, Jess and Eddie head to the Dreamerverse and pick out a handful of spooky games to test out, and they really deliver the chills. We may or may not shriek and gasp a few times as we make our way through a fan-made P.T. follow-up of sorts, as well as an unsettling game themed around purgatory that has a surprise ending. Check out the full video to see all the games we tried out. The names of the levels and content creators can also be found in the video if you want to try them yourself.

Dreams scored a 9/10 in GameSpot's review. We called it a creative and technical marvel. "It's a stunning achievement that encourages limitless creative expression, a place where people can come together, collaborate, and explore each other's imaginations," reviewer Richard Wakeling said. "It's a tool for the fools who dream, and one of the most innovative releases in years."
