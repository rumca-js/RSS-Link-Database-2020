<p>Police declare critical incident with residents fearing new inundation</p><p>Linda Davis let her groceries drop beside the piles of sandbags protecting her house in Pontypridd from the once-again surging waters of the River Taff. The 73-year-old was utterly exhausted on Saturdayafter spending all night watching the mud-brown river rise higher and higher as heavy rain swept in with Storm Jorge. “It is frightening,” she said, tears welling up in her eyes. “I’m just so tired.”</p><p>Davis’s house, along with many of her neighbours’ properties, was inundated with a metre of filthy floodwater two weeks ago in the aftermath of Storm Dennis. Since then, she and her husband, Howard, 76, have had no fridge to keep their food fresh and no hot water.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/29/pontypridd-braced-second-flood-in-fortnight-storm-jorge">Continue reading...</a>

## Manchester City fans left unhappy by curse of constantly winning trophies | Jonathan Wilson

<p>When a club ceases to be that hapless entity that drew you in, it seems success is not as much fun as everybody assumes</p><p>S ilenus the satyr, stumbling with age and wine, was taken captive by the Phrygians and taken before King Midas. But the king recognised him as a friend and joyfully led a celebration of his guest’s arrival, lasting 10 days. On the 11th day the king with gladness came to the field of Lydia and restored Silenus to his foster son, Bacchus. The god, delighted at his father’s return, offered Midas a gift. “Make it,” Midas said, “so Manchester City, whom I supported even in the Third Division days, are the richest club in the world.” Bacchus accepted and Midas returned, rejoicing in his bane. But as City won, and kept winning, he came to understand his strange misfortune, for it didn’t make him happy.</p><p>One of my earliest memories is of walking into the kitchen and saying: “I wish we lived in Liverpool.” Surprised, my mam asked why. “Because then we might win things.” Looking back, being born and growing up in Sunderland, and being unaware till much later that some people chose their teams, seems an incredibly fortunate escape. Being a fan of a superclub looks immensely stressful. Seriously, have you seen how stressed they are, all the time? Far better to have a couple of pints with your mates, drift along to the game and half-watch it talking nonsense, comfortable in the knowledge that none of it much matters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/29/manchester-city-fans-unhappy-constantly-winning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A sense of inevitability characterises Liverpool’s pursuit of the title but no longer is it one cloaked in invincibility. Yes, that’s right, Jürgen Klopp’s men have lost a Premier League game, 423 days since they last did so, and in a manner that was so complete that its unfolding felt like an almighty trick of the mind. Was this really happening? Was a side that had won their last 18 league games and maintained a 22-point lead at the top of the table really utterly out-thought, outfought and outplayed by opponents fighting relegation? Indeed they were, and then some.</p><p>Quite simply Liverpool were battered. From first minute until last Watford refused to display any sense of an inferiority complex against esteemed opponents and instead delivered a display of great togetherness, aggression and potency. They scored three and could have had more on a night that will be spoken about in these parts for years to come. That much could be taken from the thunderous roar that greeted the final whistle from the majority of those in attendance. A famous victory for Watford’s supporters to celebrate and one that also lifts their side out of the bottom three on goal difference and gives them renewed belief they can avoid the drop after all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/29/watford-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Sir Philip Rutnam has taken a stand for civil service values, but Home Office officials will come under scrutiny too<p>The low-level warfare between ministers and civil servants since Boris Johnson’s administration took office has gone nuclear. Sir Philip Rutnam has refused blandishments, and cash, and taken a stand against what he sees as an external campaign of denigration by the home secretary, Priti Patel, and her allies and an internal track record of unacceptable treatment of his staff.</p><p>It is hardly unprecedented for the top relationship in a department to break down. Usually both sides decide it’s better to go quietly – with a peerage, a job at a quango, or a package. From Rutnam’s statement it is clear that is what the Cabinet Office tried to do this time round. But he clearly thought that someone needed to stand up for the civil servants he led as permanent secretary at the Home Office, and civil service values more generally – and retreating gracefully would not do that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/29/whitehall-warfare-goes-nuclear">Continue reading...</a>

Odd wattles hang from its head. A jaunty steel and aluminium car port, like something from a 1950s motel, takes a running jump at its flank, then morphs into an angular peak that surmounts the whole composition.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2016/aug/15/julius-shulman-modernism-rediscovered-photography" title="">Prairie House, built for Greene</a> and his young family in 1961, pops up from time to time in architecture books, usually presented as a diverting proposition, an image of a future not chosen.

By this, Kranzberg meant that technology’s interaction with society is such “that technical developments frequently have environmental, social and human consequences that go far beyond the immediate purposes of the technical devices and practices themselves, and the same technology can have quite different results when introduced into different contexts or under different circumstances”.</p><p>The saloon-bar version of this is that “technology is both good and bad; it all depends on how it’s used” – a tactic that tech evangelists regularly deploy as a way of stopping the conversation.

## ‘His inner circle knew about the abuse': Daniela Soleri on her architect father Paolo

<p>Fifty years ago, his utopian desert city attracted acolytes from around the world. Can his legacy survive allegations of sexual abuse?</p><p>Arcosanti looks much as it did <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/aug/25/architecture.ethicalliving" title="">when I visited in 2008</a>: curving vaults, apses and amphitheatres with patterns inscribed in the concrete; circular windows, winding little paths, cypress trees, wind chimes tinkling in the breeze. This experimental city in the Arizona desert, founded in 1970, is like a set from a sci-fi movie for an alien civilisation more enlightened than ours.</p><p>And in some ways, Arcosanti <em>is</em> more enlightened. Its utopian community was the brainchild of Paolo Soleri, an outsider architect who looked at America’s unfolding future of consumerism, urban sprawl and environmental destruction, and decided there had to be something better. Arcosanti was a showcase for his concept of “arcology” (architecture plus ecology), which argued that cities should be compact, car-free, low-impact, civic-minded. Planned as a city of 5,000, its population has, however, rarely risen above 150. By 2008, it had come to a standstill. “The main fault is me,” Soleri told me then. He was 89, and seemed resigned. “I don’t have the gift of proselytising.” But this was not the full extent of the problem, it emerged.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/29/paolo-soleri-architect-abuser-arcosanti-utopian-city-steve-rose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coogan and Brydon continue to aggressively impersonate Michael Caine over risotto – and yet, within that, there is art</p><p>Ludicrous to think that it has been 10 years since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/15/the-trip-series-four-greece-rob-brydon-steve-coogan" title="">The Trip</a> first aired, a movie-in-the-shape-of-a-TV-show where Rob Brydon annoyed Steve Coogan around the Pennines, for no reason, while they slowly ate food. There is no way of describing The Trip without it sounding featherlight and pointless – “Two men approach their 50s by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFIQIpC5_wY&amp;list=PLAE8683DAEAA24C20" title="">aggressively impersonating Michael Caine</a> ” – but to love The Trip, as I unashamedly do, is to watch it first-hand, to consume it, to let it wash over you like a wave. Yes: a vast percentage of the show’s four episodic series is just Rob Brydon licking his lips and shouting: “WHATTYA GOT?” at a succession of politely smiling waitresses. But somehow within that there is art.</p><p>The Trip to Greece (Tuesday, 10pm, Sky One) is just every other series of The Trip, then, though this time in Greece. Brydon again plays an amped-up version of himself, clanging on the verge of annoying, seemingly missing two or three of humanity’s core social nodes, always singing that same song, a Ronnie Corbett impression that goes on too long; while Coogan does the same, playing himself-but-not-himself, the chip-shouldered, fractious actor who takes driving very seriously and always seems on the verge of a full-blown temper tantrum.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/29/brydon-coogan-the-trip-to-greece">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s a myth that wisdom comes only with age, the writer argues. Young women and girls offer new tools to use<br /></p><p>As you grow older you become an immigrant from a vanished country, a country some of your peers may remember but the young may find unimaginable or incomprehensible. You could call it the land of before; before some great change, before we did things this way, before we decided that was unacceptable, before we shed new light on an old problem. I was shaped by a world that no longer quite exists, so I can’t imagine myself at, say, 18 in the present moment, because to do so is to imagine someone utterly different. She does not exist, and I – as we all do – exist as the cumulative effect of my experiences, opportunities or lack thereof, and ideals.</p><p>So much of what shaped and scarred my younger self, and made me a solitary feminist, and then much later one among many, was the unspeakability of violence against women and all the denigration, harassment and silencing that went with it. It was epidemic, and yet every incident was supposed to be an isolated incident, and nobody was supposed to connect the crimes to the culture that relished violence against women as entertainment, and denied it existed in any significant way as fact, and made sure that prevention and prosecution were as feeble as they were rare. All those forces still exist, but something else does alongside them: a vigorous conversation, speaking and naming and describing and defining; rejecting the excuses and cover-ups and justifications.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/29/rebecca-solnit-younger-feminists-shift-understanding-give-new-tools">Continue reading...</a>

His mouth froths. He gets so excited that he spills some of his lemon and ginger tea on the floor of the photo studio we’re sitting in. “Oh dear,” he says, Iggy Pop transforming rapidly into an extremely apologetic, polite young man. “I’m just going to wipe that up with my bum.” And so he does – sliding across the floor while his black trousers soak up the drink.</p><p>A polite young man George MacKay might be, but at just 27 he’s had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/03/george-mackay-yours-sincerely-sunshine-on-leith" title="p">plenty of practice</a> trying on other personas: a closeted gay activist in Pride, a singing Scottish squaddie in Sunshine On Leith and – most recently – Lance Corporal Will Schofield in Sam Mendes’ first world war smash, 1917. He is soon to play the notorious Australian bushranger Ned Kelly in True History Of The Kelly Gang, which is where today’s unlikely punk outburst comes in: director Justin Kurzel wanted his young actors to put a punky spin on the tale of the Aussie folk hero, so he booked a gig venue and told them to perform their own songs live as a punk band.

I know it’s possible because I have seen it successfully executed, by the instructor, Star. When I try it, nothing on earth feels less likely. It’s ridiculous hubris even being in the room: no less absurd than thinking I could scale sheet glass because I’ve seen Spider-Man.</p><p>“This is quite hard,” Star begins, “and it hurts.

<p>Suddenly single at 52, I had a lot to learn about dating. But nothing prepared me for the casual racism</p><p>I had been with my partner for six years when she announced, abruptly, that it was over. I remember she was crying. I was not: I was too stunned. It was as if, in the rulebook of how to end a relationship, she had torn out the last chapter. Disagreements, rows, eating meals in silence, sleeping in separate rooms: these things were all missing from our end sequence.</p><p>So, at 52, I found myself unexpectedly single. As well as the pain of the breakup, I was also scared about single life. I had never struggled to meet women, but in the old-fashioned way: at parties, bars and clubs. This was the age of apps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/29/dating-in-age-of-apps-sex-with-a-black-man-on-bucket-list-ben-arogundade">Continue reading...</a>
