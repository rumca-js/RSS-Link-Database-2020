Half Moon Run - Favourite Boy  tekst 

Well, I heard you've got that show tonight
Don't you know that I wanna be there
But I gave my name to the girl at the door
When you knew that it wasn't there
Now I know I'm not your favorite boy
I can see it in the way you fake your smile
At least you could say I was good to you
At least you could say I tried, alright
And I know how it feels to look at you
Know you've got a lot of eyes
And you look so good in that summer dress
Against the color of the sky
And I don't know how it started
Don't know what to believe
Your head upon my shoulder
Or the ringing in my ears
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
Now here we are in the red moonlight, girl
Ooh just waiting on a feeling
And I know I'm not the only one
That stopped believin'
Now I'm floating a million miles away
Just floating on a breeze
I see you in my nightmares
I see you in my dreams
I don't know how it started
Don't know what to believe
Your head upon my shoulder
Or the ringing in my ears
I know I'm not your favorite boy
I can see it in the way you fake your smile
