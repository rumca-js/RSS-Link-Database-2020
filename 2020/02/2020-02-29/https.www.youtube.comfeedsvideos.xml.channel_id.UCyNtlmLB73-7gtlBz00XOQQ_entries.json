I first tried to make this video January 2018, but skidded out when I got distracted by Fifty Shades Freed, which inspired me to expand my already-in-the-works Fifty Shades video into a full three-part series that took most of the rest of the year to make. Then I tried again in January 2019, but things were moving along poorly, the script just wouldn't crack, and eventually I ran out of winter when I decided to Pivot to Fortnite, a video which took a huge number of hours to make. So it feels good to finally have this off my plate, even if it doesn't feel like a video that should have taken two years to come out.\n\nTo add to all that, because The Snowman is cursed, it took ten hours of revisions, fifteen different versions, to get this video past Universal, who would flag it instantly with a total global block. \n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nSpecial thanks to Kara and Crystal and all my Patrons.\n\nCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehuman\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=buYxGFWCWNg", "date_published": "2020-02-29 16:53:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
