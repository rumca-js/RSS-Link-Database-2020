Google Earth is no longer exclusive to GOogle chrome. Thanks to webassembly, a relatively new technology based on the ancien assembly programming language, Google Earth now supports Firefox, Opera and Edge Chromium. It’s good to see such an interesting web application being accessible from other browsers, and it’s a surprising move from Google, but appreciated nonetheless.

OBS, the open source scren recording and streaming studio, has received a new sponsor in the form of Facebook. The company became a Premiere Tier sponsor, donating more than 50 000$. Obviously, this doens’t give Facebook any control over the application, and the OBS team will expand as a result. I use OBS for all my screen recording, and it’s great to see this app well funded and getting what it deserves !
