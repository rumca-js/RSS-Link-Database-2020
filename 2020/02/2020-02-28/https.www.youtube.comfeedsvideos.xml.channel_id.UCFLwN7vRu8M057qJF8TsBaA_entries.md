In this week's video I am parodying those MasterClass Trailer videos. I have watched almost all the MasterClass trailers and have seen a bit of a pattern for how MasterClass lay them out. I thought it would be fun to parody them.  I most enjoyed the Penn and Teller and Gordon Ramsay MasterClass trailers, and this is heavily inspired by them.

This is by no means making fun of MasterClass, iI think thier trailers are some of the best videos online, they are entertaining, engaging and well edited. I tried to use a blend of classical music and title screens to properly emulate the feel you get from these MasterClass Trailers. Hopefully it comes across.

The other goal was to be entirely satirical of YouTube, everything I say is a joke or sarcastic, to add a twist to the heavily serious and well thought out trailers that MasterClass produce.
