We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

June 29, 2009 | Stephen Thompson 

The Omaha-based folk-pop duo Azure Ray was built around the tension between its two very different halves: the playful experimentation of Orenda Fink and the straight-to-the-heart melancholy of Maria Taylor. Ever since Azure Ray went on hiatus in 2004, Fink and Taylor have released solo records and side projects — Fink popped up as half of O+S earlier this year, while both have performed in Now It's Overhead and Bright Eyes — that play to their respective strengths. In the case of Taylor, that's meant three terrific albums (11:11, Lynn Teeter Flower and the new LadyLuck) that bleed wistful beauty.

Azure Ray just announced a short reunion tour, with an album on the way thereafter, so it's a good time to revel in the quiet, sweet sadness of Taylor's solo side. It's clear from this Tiny Desk Concert, recorded without amplification at the desk of All Songs Considered host Bob Boilen while Bob was on vacation, that Taylor has never made a go of it as a busker: In terms of volume, she's closer to Laura Gibson than Tom Jones. But hers is a wonderfully warm presence, and the setting brings out her songs' winsome essence.

This three-song set features a pair of highlights of LadyLuck — the title track and the first single, "Time Lapse Lifeline" — before closing with a devastating song from Lynn Teeter Flower. Given a spare acoustic reading, "Clean Getaway" closes the set on a tender, reflective note. Amplification wouldn't have done it justice.

Feb. 21 | Abby O'Neill -- "If you've never been to a Drumhedz show... ...we're gonna take you on a quick journey as if you're going through a record store," Chris Dave told the NPR Music offices at the top of his set, "picking up different genres of music and putting it in your bag."

Chris Dave is reasonably described as your favorite drummer's favorite drummer, or better yet, your favorite musician's favorite drummer. As a veteran session artist in the music industry, he's recorded and written with everyone from D'Angelo to Adele. The Houston native leads the Drumhedz behind a trap set, with his unorthodox, stacked crash cymbals and percussive toys.

The set snuck in with a serpentine flute line that any '70s heist flick would be proud to have. Sonic smash-cuts between the musical ideas whisk away the misconception you're in control of the ride you're about to take. Vocalist and new Drumhedz member, Aaron Camper gathered the audience with a quick invocation, putting his unique range and texture on full display.

Elzhi, formerly of Slum Village, Detroit's true-school hip-hop outfit, surprised the room with an unannounced cameo, reprising his rapid-fire cadence on "Whatever" and inciting the crowd to nod along as the Drumhedz segued into "Tainted," Slum Village's turn-of-the-millennium jam.

On "Clear View," Camper and the Drumhedz ushered in '60s psychedelia reminiscent of Jefferson Airplane's "White Rabbit," as if interpreted by Curtis Mayfield. Atmospheric keys played by Daniel Crawford ran roughshod over the mix, while Chris Dave, with his gift for syncopation, fostered a musical space for his bandmates to shine.

The melodic journey ended with a praise-song of gratitude and love of family called "Job Well Done." It was clear that Chris Dave and the Drumhedz had done just that.
