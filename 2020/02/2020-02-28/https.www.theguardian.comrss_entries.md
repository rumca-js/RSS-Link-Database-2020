<p>Platform sandals meet 40-denier tights as rock’n’roll goes bourgeois at Paris fashion week</p><p>At his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/celine">Celine</a> catwalk show on Friday night, the designer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/hedi-slimane">Hedi Slimane</a> distilled what looks to be the most compelling trend of this season of fashion shows. Working title: rock’n’roll bourgeois.<br /><br />Slim knee-length dresses were worn with slinky chain belts; towering platform sandals with sensible 40-denier semi-sheer tights; slim bootcut velvet trousers worn with Princess-line above-the-knee coats. This was a masterclass in Parisian allure: take one part Avenue Montaigne privilege, and mix with one part backstage pass.

## Jamal Lewis's precise strike gives Norwich win over Leicester

<p>Against the great escapologists of old, Norwich gave themselves genuine reason to believe a new Houdini act is possible. Nobody expects them to emulate Leicester in steaming on to win next season’s Premier League, but survival this year no longer seems out of the question and by one measure they are ahead of schedule. Back in 2014-15, Leicester began eating into a seven-point deficit with nine games to play; Daniel Farke’s side are two matches better off and a campaign that had all but been explained away as a learning experience pulsates, at least for the next week or so, with fresh life.</p><p>They deserved this win, only the second in their last 15 top-flight outings, against opponents whose deterioration in the final half-hour was a puzzle. Norwich’s tails were already up when, 20 minutes from time, their indefatigable right-back Max Aarons stole a yard on Ben Chilwell and spotted his colleague on the opposite flank making ground rapidly. Aarons crossed perceptively, bypassing everyone in the middle and allowing Jamal Lewis to size things up on the far side of the box. Lewis controlled with his chest and then, with impeccable technique, cut across the ball to spear a raking low volley across Kasper Schmeichel and send Carrow Road into raptures. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/28/norwich-leicester-premier-league-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Premier League’s first Tanzanian had no salary at his first club but Aston Villa’s striker now has his sights set on Manchester City at Wembley</p><p>Mbwana Samatta is the son of a policeman but pays little attention to the law of probability. Good thing, too, otherwise the player who grew up kicking rolled-up plastic bags around the streets of Dar es Salaam would not be preparing to lead the line for Aston Villa at Wembley. More than 10 family members will be watching from the stands in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final and millions of his fellow Tanzanians will be cheering him on from farther afield. From Birmingham to east Africa, fans have invested a lot of hope in this 27-year-old. And that is how he likes it.</p><p>Samatta says he always wanted to be someone on whom folks could rely. At first he thought he should become a solider – “Just to be someone for the people, they could look and say: ‘Because of him, we are safe’” – but instead he achieved something far more improbable by becoming, following January’s £8.5m arrival from Genk, the first Tanzanian to play in the Premier League and the centre-forward whom Villa want to fire them to their first major trophy since 1996. Sure, Villa are underdogs but that does not matter to Samatta. Talent and strength of will have taken him a long way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/28/mbwana-samatta-aston-villa-carabao-cup-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Managing the economic and health risks of Covid-19 is difficult. In the UK, as elsewhere, ministers must step up</p><p>A passenger on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan became the first Briton to die of the Covid-19 coronavirus on Friday. Further UK cases beyond the 20 already confirmed are expected, while countries including Mexico, Nigeria and Denmark have announced their first positive tests. The World Health Organization assesses the level of risk as “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-live-updates-latest-news-china-wuhan-stock-markets-update" title="">very high at global level”</a>. But the scale and impact of the Covid-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, in December, remain deeply uncertain. That is because whle viral outbreaks have happened before, each one is different. While severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) had a higher death rate, Covid-19 appears to be more contagious. Its spread is already being determined in hard-to-predict ways by human behaviour.</p><p>To limit the damage as far as possible, trust and information are of the essence. In the UK, as elsewhere, it is imperative that the government, and other public bodies, provide straightforward advice about travel and sanitation as well as the disease. For the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to say earlier this week that he would not travel to northern Italy was unwise because it contradicted official guidance. Instead, ministers must lead by example.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/the-guardian-view-on-the-coronavirus-outbreak-leadership-is-required">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the Sun Yang case the only thing clear about the way Fina runs swimming is the water in the pool</p><p>In August 2016, two years after Sun Yang was banned for three months because he’d been caught using an illegal stimulant, he won the Olympic 200m freestyle. It was his third gold medal, after his victories in the 400m and 1500m at London 2012. Sun explained the drug was medication for a heart problem. Still, it’s fair to say that some people there weren’t too happy about it. Australian freestyler Mack Horton called him a “drugs cheat”, French backstroker Camille Lacourt said he “pisses purple”. Others, though, seemed to be genuinely pleased for him. Particularly Cornel Marculescu, the executive director of Fina, the international swimming federation, who gave Sun a long hug after he stepped off the podium.</p><p>Afterwards, Sun explained that Marculescu had been “like a grandfather” to him. “He is a very good friend of the Chinese swim team,” he said. “So I was very happy to see him see me win the gold. I hope this friendship will last.” It did. A year later, Fina made a special point of celebrating “this friendship” at its World Aquatics Gala in the Chinese city of Sanya, when it presented Sun with a bespoke award for “Outstanding Contribution to Swimming Popularity in China”. Asked about it afterwards, a Fina spokesman <a href="https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1058724/fina-give-outstanding-contribution-to-swimming-popularity-award-to-convicted-drugs-cheat" title="">told Inside the Games</a> the award had been made at “the request of the China Swimming Association”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/28/sun-yang-benefited-from-convenient-friendship-with-swimmings-chiefs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Supermarkets are running out of hand sanitiser as people rush to protect themselves from Covid-19. But does it beat using soap and water?</p><p>As the public and governments grapple with understanding Covid-19 and how to curb its spread, sales of hand sanitiser gel have soared. In the UK, some supermarkets have already run out and Boots is rationing purchases to two bottles a customer. But is hand gel really effective against coronavirus? And, if so, should we be making our own if it is not available in the shops or online?</p><p>Hand sanitiser is not new. In 1966, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/may/13/do-we-really-need-hand-sanitisers" title="">Lupe Hernandez</a>, a student nurse from Bakersfield, California, patented the idea of an alcohol-based gel to clean hands in the absence of handwashing facilities. However, it was not until the <a href="https://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/en/" title="">H1N1 swine flu pandemic</a> in 2009 that the product went from being used in institutions to something the public carried with them. That year, sales of antibacterial gels and wipes in the US soared by more than 70% in six months. By 2010, little bottles of the stuff were everywhere – from checkout counters in airport bookshops to online retailers offering customisable dispensers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/hand-sanitiser-or-hand-washing-which-more-effective-against-coronavirus-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Musicians used to start out playing pubs – now the likes of Lewis Capaldi are booking arenas before their debut album. Is this sudden success damaging long-term careers?</p><p>Picking up an honour earlier this month at LA’s Pollstar awards, which celebrate achievements in live music, Elton John delivered some advice. “To people who manage people who are young: don’t put them in big arenas too soon, make it interesting. If I was Lewis Capaldi’s manager, I wouldn’t put him into Madison Square Garden. I’d say, we’ll play two nights at Radio City. Let him have the demand … You build up a career.”</p><p>But Capaldi, the Grammy-nominated Scottish singer who had 2019’s biggest-selling album in the UK and a No 1 single in the US, is already at arena level – his 2020 tour, beginning next week, will see him play some of the UK’s biggest venues, including two nights at London’s Wembley Arena. He is one of a few artists playing giant rooms after just one album: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/12/sam-fender-hypersonic-missiles-review">Sam Fender</a> and Dermot Kennedy will soon play two shows each at Alexandra Palace, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/billie-eilish">Billie Eilish</a> plays four O2 Arena dates in July. Scottish troubadour <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/dec/17/gerry-cinnamon-review-o2-academy-glasgow">Gerry Cinnamon</a> is set to play arenas, castles, parks and even Glasgow’s Hampden Park stadium. Selling that many tickets on a debut album campaign contrasts with the slow-and-steady strategy that worked for Elton John and many more of the world’s biggest acts. Even Adele didn’t play the O2 Arena until releasing her third album, and Ed Sheeran visited on his second.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/28/why-young-pop-stars-are-suddenly-playing-arenas-lewis-capaldi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The keeping of one and brewing of the other have long gone hand in hand in this beautiful market town</p><p><strong>What’s going for it?</strong> Sheep and beer. Beer and sheep. Sheep, beer. Beer, sheep. Often together (ahhh, a pint of Black Sheep! A lamb and ale stew! A lamb and ale stew with a pint of Black Sheep on the side... now you’re talking). There’s no getting away from them in Masham. There can’t be many places this size with two – TWO! – illustrious breweries in them. I wouldn’t be surprised if the citizens of this beautiful market town on the flanks of the Yorkshire Dales were buried with a fleece and a flagon of ale. Thanks to the monks (Jervaulx and Fountains Abbeys dominated these parts for centuries), the keeping of sheep and the brewing of beer have long gone hand in hand round here. They’re in the blood, in the culture (the fabulous <a href="https://www.mashamsheepfair.com/" title="">Masham Sheep Fair </a>is a sight to behold), in the landscape and definitely in the history. There are, it’s true, other things to do in Masham. A teacake, perhaps, at Johnny Baghdad’s. Fish’n’chips at Harry’s. You could potter round the giftshops, buy a canvas in one of the art galleries, play an over on the cricket pitch. There is, whisper it, a fine wine merchant in town. But remember, these are but sideshows to the main events. Move here and ewe will think beer and dream sheep. There’s no escape.</p><p><strong>The case against</strong> What? You’re a vegan teetotaller? Also, out of the way, though not particularly remote; and quietly rural for those who like their hubbub.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/feb/28/lets-move-to-masham-north-yorkshire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spanish brand sashays into Paris fashion week with unfamiliar shapes for autumn 2020</p><p>A new silhouette was born on the catwalk at Paris fashion week on Friday morning. Flat at the front, with a tight black panel running from the abdomen to the throat, it puffed out at the hips and lower belly around the curve of a deep scooped bodice.</p><p>That unfamiliar shape was presented three times, in forest green, cobalt blue and buttercream brocade, on the Loewe catwalk. Other novel shapes followed: three more gowns with tight black bodices, in cinnamon, cream and electric blue, covered the upper torso with a large off-the-shoulder ruffle, and sprouted out, in a cascade of brocade, at the mid-back. Later there were three dresses with drop shoulders, balloon sleeves and a drop waist at the side of which were two pannier-like points of fabric.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/28/paris-fashion-week-a-silhouette-is-born-loewe-changes-shapes-with-new-collection">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor has been battling for justice since the Hollywood producer attacked her more than 20 years ago. She talks about how that fight cost her motherhood and her career – but helped spark a movement<br /><br /></p><p>Wow, has it been a huge week.” Rose McGowan is speaking on the phone from New York, vivid, unguarded, persuasive, so much more campaigner than celebrity. On Monday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/24/harvey-weinstein-guilty-trial-charges-verdict" title="">Harvey Weinstein was found guilty of rape and sexual assault</a>. McGowan was not in court, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/23/rose-mcgowan-harvey-weinstein-lawsuit-rape-allegations#maincontent" title="">her accusation of rape against Weinstein</a> will never be brought, as a civil or criminal case. One of the stunning side notes of this scandal is the impact of having a statute of limitations in cases of sexual violence: more than 100 women have made chillingly similar allegations against Weinstein, yet only a handful of them were recent enough for charges to be pressed.</p><p>McGowan woke up an hour after the verdict was delivered, to a “raft of messages on my phone. And I thought: ‘He must be guilty because otherwise nobody would have texted me.’ The week before the trial, I got very little contact.” This has been McGowan’s reality since 1997, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein" title="">Weinstein assaulted her at the Sundance film festival</a>: she had pariah status, peppered periodically in gossip columns with insinuations about her character. Weinstein, as many of his victims attested, could freeze out an adversary so comprehensively that their phone would never ring again. “Everybody expected him to get off, including me,” says McGowan. “In my experience with this stuff, his defences were so strong. The two cases that were chosen to prosecute had never been successfully prosecuted in a court of law [because his accusers had continued to have contact with him after his attacks]. And also, I’m just a woman. We expect to get absolutely nothing. We’re so used to being dumped on that why would anybody believe us?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/28/rose-mcgowan-i-wont-be-free-of-harvey-weinstein-until-hes-dead-or-i-am">Continue reading...</a>

Computer scientist who made the cut, copy and paste commands simple to use<p>Anyone who uses the cut, copy and paste commands on their computer or mobile device has Larry Tesler to thank for making them so simple and easy to use. </p><p>Tesler, who has died aged 74, began his work on cut, copy and paste in 1973, when he was hired by Xerox’s Palo Alto Research Center (Parc) in California. Among other things he worked with a fellow computer scientist, Tim Mott, on the development of Gypsy, a “modeless” word processor. At the time most software had modes: for example, you might press I to enter the insert mode, or R for the replace mode. But Tesler’s research showed that non-expert users found modes confusing – and so he began to fight against them. He had “Nomodes” as his car numberplate and, later, a website at nomodes.com.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/28/larry-tesler-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sleep deprivation makes perspective a long-forgotten friend, my days spent mentally spiralling off the smallest thing</p><p>A while ago, I came across the work of motivational speaker Eric Thomas, who is a bit like the US megastar life coach Tony Robbins, except, in his own words, “hip hop”. Thomas’s talks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1d28mrBqCQliL_N48tZZiw" title="">I found them on YouTube</a>) are shouty, inspirational monologues in which he berates people for not wanting success enough: they think they want it, but they need to want it the way they want to breathe. And I do find them quite motivating, once you get past the fact that this logic completely ignores social circumstance as the primary driver of success.</p><p>One of the things that Thomas asserts is that he wakes up at 3am. This enables him to get loads of stuff done while everyone else is asleep, and so stay ahead of the competition. He says cool-sounding things like, “I use pain to push me to greatness”, and “I do not take constructive criticism from people who have never constructed anything”, which implies you should only take advice from builders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/28/romesh-ranganathan-getting-up-at-5am-to-chase-the-tiger">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The truth about the protective value of face masks and how easy it is to catch Covid-19</p><p>Many individuals who get coronavirus will experience nothing worse than seasonal flu symptoms, but the overall profile of the disease, including its mortality rate, looks more serious. At the start of an outbreak the apparent mortality rate can be an overestimate if a lot of mild cases are being missed. But this week, a WHO expert suggested that this has not been the case with Covid-19. Bruce Aylward, who led an international mission to China to learn about the virus and the country’s response, said the evidence did not suggest that we were only seeing the tip of the iceberg. If borne out by further testing, this could mean that current estimates of a roughly 1% fatality rate are accurate. This would make Covid-19 about 10 times more deadly than seasonal flu, which is estimated to kill between 290,000 and 650,000 people a year globally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-truth-myths-flu-covid-19-face-masks">Continue reading...</a>

I can still taste it when I think about it.</p><p>Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things.

Sharp shadows suggest the sun has broken through the cloud, while the sheep boast their thick winter coats.

<p>For a leader to holiday while floods hit the country isn’t normal, but ours believes in his own exceptionalism</p><p>Eight years after she died, Whitney Houston is to make a stadium comeback tour. At least a hologram of her is. So thousands of people will be paying to see someone who isn’t really there, while a live band plays along to a recording of her voice. However much you may have loved Whitney, it’s hard to think of anything more genuinely pointless. Do people imagine they are getting the same experience as if she was still alive? I’ve always felt that I lost out by being too young to see Maria Callas on stage, but nothing would induce me to attend a performance of Tosca in which a hologram of her appeared alongside current opera stars. Just about the only place where such fakery might work would be Eurovision. Personally, I’ve never got why so many people take the song contest so seriously. It seems self-evident both that most nations don’t much like the UK and vote in blocs against us and that we actually quite like the feeling of coming nearly last. Which is why the public invariably has chosen an entirely forgettable and rubbish song. Nor does this year’s attempt to professionalise the UK entry by cutting out the public middlemen and getting a record company to make the selection appear to have made any difference. On one hearing – more than enough – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/27/james-newman-my-last-breath-uk-eurovision-entry">the chosen song</a> is just as crap as ever. If we really wanted to get serious about winning the competition again, we should enter a hologram of a barefooted Sandie Shaw singing Puppet on a String. That would clean up, just as it did back in 1967.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/28/johnson-shows-get-away-with-stuff-other-pm-couldnt">Continue reading...</a>

Yes, 2020 is a leap year, which means we all get an extra day, and this year, for the first time in almost 30 years, 29 February falls on a Saturday. </p><p>People born on 29 February will be able to celebrate their birthdays on the right day for the first time in four years. Being a “leaper” or “leapling” makes some feel special, but others are peeved about logistical pitfalls such as with driving licences or passports expiring on days that don’t exist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/28/betrothals-babies-and-big-birthdays-how-people-make-the-most-of-the-leap-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I believed that God loved me and had a plan for me – and that plan did not include homosexuality</p><p>I moved out of home when I was 18. My first place was an apartment and I became friendly with the guy who lived above me. I was having a beer with him one night and asked him if he was gay. I told him I had always wondered whether I was.</p><p>I had sex with him that night. He was much older than me, and I wasn’t attracted to him, but I wanted to experience what it was like to be with a man. Afterwards, I felt awful about what had happened. When I was growing up, the word “gay” was a slur; I’d only ever heard negative things about homosexual life. My parents would call and I’d start crying, but I could never tell them why.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/28/i-was-a-gay-conversion-therapist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having once lived life as a high-stakes game, Nirpal Dhaliwal has turned his back on the lemming-like pursuit of high-octane moments. He explains the rich rewards of embracing safety </p><p>As a young man, I relished the sharp tang of risk; that piquant charge that accompanies the taste of a first, preferably illicit, kiss, or when stepping off a plane in an unknown city to find hazardous sport among strangers.</p><p>Life was a high-stakes game in which it was always best to twist – never to stick. True pleasure, I mistakenly thought, came always at the chance of a painful price. Relationships, money, even my health, were all things I was happy to wager in this endless pursuit of an explosive experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/safe-is-the-new-bold/2020/feb/28/from-fomo-to-jomo-why-i-now-prefer-a-life-less-risky">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Activists hope appeal court’s decision will mean death of third runway expansion plan</p><p>In the bar of the Five Bells pub, campaigners against a third runway at Heathrow were celebrating.</p><p>The 400-year-old establishment in Harmondsworth has been at the centre of the fight against the airport’s expansion for nearly 20 years. Under the plans, half of the ancient village would be destroyed, including a number of listed buildings and a small housing estate. The rest would be at the perimeter fence of the new runway, and would be, residents say, uninhabitable due to the thunderous noise and pollution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/28/campaigners-celebrate-heathrow-ruling-as-beginning-of-the-end">Continue reading...</a>

## What Noma did next: how the ‘New Nordic’ is reshaping the food world

<p>In our time of climate crisis and inequality, as top chefs dream less of Michelin stars and more of changing the world, the New Nordic movement is reaching beyond haute cuisine into classrooms, supermarkets and parliaments. By Kieran Morris</p><p>Few restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World’s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are <a href="https://journals.openedition.org/aof/7249" title="">Noma dissertations</a> and dozens of “<a href="https://www.grubstreet.com/2019/06/noma-plant-kingdom-menu-platt.html" title="">Nomaheads</a>” – dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again. In the early 2010s, there were so many articles about hunting for wild produce with Noma’s charismatic head chef that one writer <a href="https://www.eater.com/2011/5/3/6683095/the-era-of-the-i-foraged-with-rene-redzepi-piece" title="">declared it</a> “The Era of the ‘I Foraged With René Redzepi’ Piece”. There is even a 240-page <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/553576/hungry-by-jeff-gordinier/" title="">travelogue</a>, written by an Esquire editor who followed Redzepi across the world for four years.</p><p>But all the attention that has been lavished on Noma’s hyperlocal, micro-seasonal food – butterflies moulded from blackcurrant leather; 100-year-old mahogany clams served in their shell – has obscured the much more ambitious aims that the restaurant’s creators, alumni and allies have been trying to achieve. Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/28/what-noma-did-next-new-nordic-food-rene-redzepi-claus-meyer-locavore-foraging">Continue reading...</a>
