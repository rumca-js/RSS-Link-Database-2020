One of the stunning side notes of this scandal is the impact of having a statute of limitations in cases of sexual violence: more than 100 women have made chillingly similar allegations against Weinstein, yet only a handful of them were recent enough for charges to be pressed.</p><p>McGowan woke up an hour after the verdict was delivered, to a \u201craft of messages on my phone. And I thought: \u2018He must be guilty because otherwise nobody would have texted me.\u2019 The week before the trial, I got very little contact.\u201d This has been McGowan\u2019s reality since 1997, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/30/brave-rose-mcgowans-memoir-details-by-harvey-weinstein\" title=\"\">Weinstein assaulted her at the Sundance film festival</a>: she had pariah status, peppered periodically in gossip columns with insinuations about her character. Weinstein, as many of his victims attested, could freeze out an adversary so comprehensively that their phone would never ring again. \u201cEverybody expected him to get off, including me,\u201d says McGowan. \u201cIn my experience with this stuff, his defences were so strong. The two cases that were chosen to prosecute had never been successfully prosecuted in a court of law [because his accusers had continued to have contact with him after his attacks]. And also, I\u2019m just a woman. We expect to get absolutely nothing.

By Kieran Morris</p><p>Few restaurants have enjoyed as much acclaim and influence, or been as widely caricatured, as the Copenhagen fine-dining institution Noma. In its 16 years of existence, it has been at the top of the World\u2019s 50 Best Restaurants list four times. There are three Noma books, two feature-length films and a Noma documentary series. There are <a href=\"https://journals.openedition.org/aof/7249\" title=\"\">Noma dissertations</a> and dozens of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.grubstreet.com/2019/06/noma-plant-kingdom-menu-platt.html\" title=\"\">Nomaheads</a>\u201d \u2013 dedicated diners who follow the restaurant all over the world, from Yucatan to Tokyo to Sydney and back again.

Noma as a traditional haute cuisine restaurant, with its elegant cookbooks and high-concept food, is being overtaken by a grander project. The people behind the restaurant are trying to expand New Nordic, a culinary movement they began in Scandinavia 15 years ago, to the rest of the globe. In doing so, they want to transform every link in the long chain of how food is produced and consumed, from the dirt up to your dinner table.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/28/what-noma-did-next-new-nordic-food-rene-redzepi-claus-meyer-locavore-foraging\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/28/what-noma-did-next-new-nordic-food-rene-redzepi-claus-meyer-locavore-foraging", "date_published": "2020-02-28 06:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus spreads around the world \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>As cases of people infected with the coronavirus or Covid-19 grow rapidly in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the rest of the world is bracing for a pandemic</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-spreads-across-the-world-in-pictures\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-spreads-across-the-world-in-pictures", "date_published": "2020-02-28 05:45:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Who should lead Labour? \u2013 podcast", "description": "<p>Ballots went out to Labour members this week as the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader intensifies.
