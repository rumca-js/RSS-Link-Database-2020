Half Moon Run - Favourite Boy  tekst 

Well, I heard you've got that show tonight
Don't you know that I wanna be there
But I gave my name to the girl at the door
When you knew that it wasn't there
Now I know I'm not your favorite boy
I can see it in the way you fake your smile
At least you could say I was good to you
At least you could say I tried, alright
And I know how it feels to look at you
Know you've got a lot of eyes
And you look so good in that summer dress
Against the color of the sky
And I don't know how it started
Don't know what to believe
Your head upon my shoulder
Or the ringing in my ears
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
I don't know what's happening
Now here we are in the red moonlight, girl
Ooh just waiting on a feeling
And I know I'm not the only one
That stopped believin'
Now I'm floating a million miles away
Just floating on a breeze
I see you in my nightmares
I see you in my dreams
I don't know how it started
Don't know what to believe
Your head upon my shoulder
Or the ringing in my ears
I know I'm not your favorite boy
I can see it in the way you fake your smile

Half Monn Run - Full Circle tekst 

Cap off kneeling at the back of the church,
Feeling water on your brow, if it's healing it hurts
At first a sharpish pain that returns as a thought
That the needle in your skin will bring you closer to god
And I watch as your head turns full circle
Our hope was with a coffee and a medical text
It's too easy knowin' nothing blowing off the rest
And the riddles in the pages leave at too much to guess
And the worry cracks a fracture from your hip to your chest
As I watch as your head turns full circle
We got lost in the travels in the spiritual book
Missed the beaches from nirvana and the way that they look
And the crooks they're on the island they're killin' to keep runnin'
They're running severance on the plastic and it seems to be working
Is that the best that I can do?
As I watch as your head turns full circle
You appear even tempered though your looks will deceive
And the sparks are always flying cause you drink for relief
With the heart of a child and the wit of a fool
It's a wonder why I don't try to build a wall around you
When I watch as your head turns full circle
And I watch as your head turns full circle
Yeah I watch as your head turns full circle
