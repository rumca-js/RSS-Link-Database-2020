It's called System Override, and will offer plenty of new content--some of which will stick around but most of which will be gone after two weeks. Keep watching to learn everything you need to know about what's coming in System Override.\n\nLet's start with the limited-time stuff. During System Override, you'll have access to a new mode called Deja Loot. Though the drop ship path and ring closure pattern will change day-to-day in the new mode, loot placement won't. The loot spawn is permanently set during Deja Loot.\n\nSo if you happen to find a perfectly outfitted Triple-Take somewhere, you can rest easy knowing that same Triple-Take will spawn in that exact spot for every match you play. Just don't rest too easy--chances are if you know where all the best loot will spawn, your opponents will too. Deja Loot will take place on World's Edge during the first week of System Override before transitioning to Kings Canyon for the second week.\n\nIn Deja Loot, you'll also find a brand-new piece of armor: the Evo Shield. This glowing body shield starts out weaker than a common white one, but damaging enemies will allow it to grow stronger. At max strength, the Evo Shield surpasses an epic purple body shield--rivaling a legendary gold one.\n\nRespawn has said the Evo Shield will remain exclusive to Deja Loot for now, but the team will consider adding the armor to the main game based on player feedback.\n\nSystem Override presents plenty of limited-time cosmetics to earn too. Complete in-game challenges and you'll move up in the Prize Track, allowing you to unlock rewards. There are also 24 themed, limited-time cosmetics that you can purchase through Apex Coins or Crafting Materials or earn through special Apex Packs. Nab all 24 and you'll earn Octane's heirloom: a butterfly knife that also acts as a Stim syringe.\n\nPermanent changes will be made in System Override too. Do you want one of those cool-looking character heirlooms, but you're scared that the RNG gods will curse you with the exact one you don't want? Once System Override starts, you don't have to worry about that.\n\nInstead of randomly earning an heirloom from opening Apex Packs, players will instead earn heirloom shards. With these shards, you can construct whichever heirloom you want, whether you want Wraith, Bloodhound, Lifeline, or Pathfinder. Once System Override ends, the Octane heirloom will be added to the pool too. This heirloom system will stick around even after System Override ends.\n\nAnd that's everything there is to know about System Override ahead of the event.

Creators have already built some amazing things with Dreams, and this includes some creepy and bizarre horror games.\n\nIn a new video, Jess and Eddie head to the Dreamerverse and pick out a handful of spooky games to test out, and they really deliver the chills. We may or may not shriek and gasp a few times as we make our way through a fan-made P.T. follow-up of sorts, as well as an unsettling game themed around purgatory that has a surprise ending.

It's almost out and we got a taste of it at the PAX East 2020 show floor. Granted, Animal Crossing is all about living your in-game life over the course of days, weeks, and months, but the demo let us check out a little bit of the crafting system, the new Able Sisters shop, and the expansive museum.\n\nThe crafting system has gathering specific resources to construct the necessities like the fishing rod or vaulting pole, but also new pieces of furniture to deck out your house. To craft items, you'll need to go to the shop run by Timmy and Tommy Nook. The Able Sisters shop lets you browse for new outfits and you can dress yourself with pants, shirts, socks, shoes, hats, and glasses--it's the deepest fashion has gotten in Animal Crossing. The museum was especially impressive, now including a biodome for all the bugs you collect, an aquarium for all fish you catch, and wide open showcase for all the fossils you dig up. The PAX East show floor demo also allowed for four-player couch co-op where friends can hop on and explore your island with you.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons launches on Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020.

Here are some competitive battle tactics that every trainer should know in Pokemon Sword and Shield.\n\nEven if you've played every Pokemon game, there's a good chance you've never played it competitively. That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding--it's worth it, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.\n\nIn the last video we broke down how a Pokemon\u2019s stats are laid out. In Part 2, we dig into how battling works: abilities, speed and priority, weather, shutting down strong attackers, and much more.\n\nIn GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, \"In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place. You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch.\"\n\nTimestamps:\n00:52 - Abilities Breakdown\n01:24 - Stat Changes\n03:01 - Speed & Priority\n06:02 - Shutting Down Attackers\n07:23 - Redirection\n08:11 - Protect & Switching Out\n08:58 - Common Held Items\n10:37 - Weather\n12:42 - Terrain\n13:38 - Dynamaxing\n15:09 - Conclusion\n\n#Pokemon #SwordAndShield #GameSpot #CompetitivePokemon", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMt8-FQ5SME", "date_published": "2020-02-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Dark Pictures Anthology: Little Hope - Official Trailer Ft.
