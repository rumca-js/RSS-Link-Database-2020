## DAU. Natasha review – an exquisitely sinister study of Soviet oppression
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/26/dau-natasha-review-russia-ilya-khrzhanovsky](https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/26/dau-natasha-review-russia-ilya-khrzhanovsky)

<p>As part of a colossal art project, Ilya Khrzhanovsky has made an intimately eerie examination of the banality of evil<br /></p><p>On its own terms, DAU. Natasha is a brutally queasy and stark picture of the life of a fictional woman who works in the staff canteen of a Stalin-era scientific research institute in Moscow, headed by theoretical physicist Lev Landau (nicknamed “Dau”). It shows us her quarrelsome relationship with her younger assistant Olga, who waits on tables while Natasha serves at the till. Eventually, the film gives us a look inside Room 101, with all its terror and squalor.</p><p>However, the film cannot simply be judged on its own terms, but as part of a gigantic (but mostly unseen and perhaps unseeable) whole: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/26/inside-the-stalinist-truman-show-dau-i-had-absolute-freedom-until-the-kgb-grabbed-me">a colossal multimedia art</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jan/26/inside-the-stalinist-truman-show-dau-i-had-absolute-freedom-until-the-kgb-grabbed-me"> installation project 15 years in the making</a> that has become legend. Not least, this is because of its weird similarity to the <em>folie de grandeur </em>envisaged by the fictional theatre director in Charlie Kaufman’s 2008 film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/synecdoche-new-york">Synecdoche, New York</a>, who proposed an entire city block full of actors improvising “real” lives on a 24/7 basis for months and years until the director thinks the resulting dramas are ready to be shown to an audience. This film originated as a conventional biopic of Landau begun in 2006, but which director Ilya Khrzhanovsky repurposed by taking the part-replica of the Moscow institute, built already in Ukraine for location shooting purposes, and then finishing every room inside as an absolutely accurate clone of the research institute. It was filled it with hundreds of actors who lived and “worked” in an ongoing improvisation there for months, cut off from the internet and the outside world, before shooting could begin, showing the many stories generated within this artificial universe. So far, 13 films have emerged from the Dau project, 12 of which were shown last year at an immersive Dau exhibition in Paris. This is the first of the Dau franchise to be shown in conventional theatrical terms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/26/dau-natasha-review-russia-ilya-khrzhanovsky">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having kids and buying a house become the stuff of nightmares in Lorcan Finnegan’s black comedy, starring Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg</p><p>There’s a type of film you could call burbstruck: horrified and yet sort of fascinated by the blank, bland, affectless sprawl of the suburbs in all their conformity and philistinism. Here is the American dream, a becalmed prosperity. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/14/house-real-star-bong-joon-ho-oscar-winner-parasite">what unresolved yearnings lie </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/14/house-real-star-bong-joon-ho-oscar-winner-parasite">behind the white picket fences</a> and intensively manicured lawns? What suppressed needs have coagulated there? In David Lynch’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2012/feb/10/david-lynch-blue-velvet-bfi">Blue Velvet</a>, a severed human ear is found in the soil, signalling a hypersensitivity to subterranean stirrings of something really strange. Sam Mendes’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/13/american-beauty-20th-anniversary-analysis">American Beauty</a> – perhaps the most famous burbstricken film of modern times – found in the moonscape of a suburban development a liberating exoticism and eroticism. (Not all film-makers make an ironised fetish of the suburbs, though: Steven Spielberg often treasures the reassuring normality.)</p><p>Now director Lorcan Finnegan and his co-screenwriter Garret Shanley tap into this residential nightmare for a comic horror parable, which I found highly entertaining and bizarre. It’s a bad dream of what it means to settle down somewhere affordable because you’ve got a child to look after. Or maybe it’s the very fact of having a child that creates its own suburbanism of the soul, a marginalisation of lived experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/26/vivarium-review-jesse-eisenberg-imogen-poots">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on food and Brexit: trust is not on the menu | Editorial

<p>Farmers and consumers know they cannot believe the prime minister’s assurances over post-Brexit standards</p><p>Most people pay little attention to the chain of production that brings food to their plates. Americans eat tonnes of chicken every year, unaware of, or unconcerned by, the chemical rinse applied to its pre-cooked carcass. British consumers might also eat chlorine-washed chicken if they had acquired the habit, but since they haven’t the idea is <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-refuses-food-chlorinated-chicken-promise-trump-brexit-terrifying-2020-2?r=US&amp;IR=T" title="">unappetising</a>. This is a problem in transatlantic trade talks because US agribusiness wants access to UK dining tables. The politics of serving food prepared to US safety standards is tricky on a number of levels. Alongside chlorinated chicken, the use of growth-promoting hormones and antibiotics in meat production are more tightly regulated in Europe than in many countries that want to export their surplus meat. After Brexit, the UK can abandon EU standards, but if it does so it will find its produce barred from continental markets.</p><p>Eurosceptics call that protectionism, and partly it is. European food safety standards have a scientific rationale – the idea is that hygiene should be maintained all along the chain, not dealt with at the last stage by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/boris-johnson-must-examine-the-science-of-cheap-food-imports" title="">blasting</a> microbes with disinfectant. But those rules are bundled up with a system that insulates the sector from global competition. The EU subsidises farmers, recognising how destabilising it would be if a glut of cheap American produce was dumped on their markets. Some Eurosceptics embrace that destabilisation as an economic tonic, others deny it would happen. Pro-leave campaigners advertised cheaper food as a benefit of Brexit, omitting to explain that a price would be paid by farmers. That sleight of hand was easier to accomplish in propaganda than as government policy. The National Farmers’ Union vehemently opposes lowering regulatory barriers to American produce. The NFU president, Minette Batters, this week said doing so would be “insane” and “<a href="https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/country-and-farming/farming-leader-warns-against-morally-bankrupt-trade-deals-which-could-see-sub-standard-food-our-plates-1964986" title="">morally bankrupt</a>”. Downing Street insists high standards will be maintained, but Boris Johnson wants a trade deal with the US and is not renowned for keeping his word. George Eustice, the environment secretary, tries to assuage farmers’ fears without giving them <a href="https://twitter.com/lisaocarroll/status/1232590374704734208?s=20" title="">explicit guarantees</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/the-guardian-view-on-food-and-brexit-trust-is-not-on-the-menu">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It has been used to contain epidemics for thousands of years – and is a crucial response to the current health crisis, too. But when did quarantining people begin?<br /></p><p><a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/02/22/asia/china-coronavirus-roundup-intl-hnk/index.html" title="">China has resorted to mass quarantining</a> in response to the coronavirus epidemic, while towns in Italy with high infection rates have been cordoned off and holidaymakers in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/no-one-has-told-us-anything-tourists-on-lockdown-in-tenerife-hotel-coronavirus" title="">Tenerife</a> are confined to their rooms. The rest of us can only watch and try not to panic. But this is far from the first time that freedom of movement has been curtailed because of fears of a pandemic.</p><p>The modern notion of quarantine dates back to the 15th century, when Venice was grappling with one of the recurrent outbreaks of the Black Death, which had devastated Asia and Europe in the 14th century and continued to reappear for the next 500 years. The idea of isolating potential carriers, usually sailors arriving on ships from Asia, where the plague originated, was common in the 14th century, but it wasn’t until 1448 that the Venetian authorities decreed the period of isolation to check for symptoms should be 40 (<em>quaranta</em> in Italian) days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2020/feb/26/coronavirus-quarantines-brief-history-contain-epidemics">Continue reading...</a>

## Big quip energy! The perfect rehabilitation of Pete Davidson

<p>He may be more famous for dating Ariana Grande than being on SNL, but with his new Netflix standup special, Davidson finally bares his truth ... and tackles the rumours about his penis<br /></p><p>If ever there was a time for Pete Davidson to release a career-defining standup special, it’s now. Because, as things stand, Davidson’s work as a writer and actor has been fully eclipsed by the fact that he is rarely out of the tabloids. You know about his endless high-profile romances, with figures such as Ariana Grande and Kate Beckinsale. You know about his struggles with mental health and substance abuse and self-harm. You know about his running battle with Saturday Night Live, the show he barely turns up for, openly wishes to leave and yet still inexplicably sticks with. You know the rumours about his penis that spawned the phrase “big dick energy”. You know all this because Pete Davidson: The Walking Headline is much more interesting than Pete Davidson: The Man Who Tells Jokes for a Living.</p><p>So Davidson’s new Netflix special Alive From New York is a perfect way to redress the balance. By turning in an incisive, honest, well-honed set, he could single-handedly reverse the tide of bad press. It has happened before: John Mulaney used The Comeback Kid to catapult himself from a failed sitcom star to the world’s best standup; Aziz Ansari used <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/20/aziz-ansari-netflix-special">Right Now to </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/20/aziz-ansari-netflix-special">reset his career after allegations of sexual assault</a>; Patton Oswalt’s Annihilation saw the comic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/10/patton-oswalt-bereavement-without-daughter-drinking-would-have-been-problem">come to terms with the death of his wife</a> through pure catharsis. Alive From New York is the best chance that Davidson will ever have to reframe a narrative that he appears to be lumbered with.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/26/big-quip-energy-the-perfect-rehabilitation-of-pete-davidson-ariana-grande">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Sydney chef is recreating the dishes that nourished the suffragette movement</p><p>When Liz Mason opened a cookbook from 1886, the last thing she expected was a recipe for turtle murder. And yet, between gallons of cream and lifestyle tips like how to remove your kidskin gloves, there was a description of concealing a “deadly weapon” with “great ingenuity”. “I have known half an hour to be consumed in the process,” wrote the recipe’s architect Anna Ella Carroll. The resulting dish, found in a chapter called “Fish, Oysters and Clams” is terrapin soup but “decidedly the terrapin has to be killed before cooking”.</p><p>“I can’t imagine putting terrapin on a menu in Sydney,” Mason reflects. But she seems slightly tempted. For the last six months, the executive chef has been experimenting with recipes from The Woman Suffrage Cookbook, originally compiled in Boston by Hattie A Burr, and a British book – The Women’s Suffrage Cookery Book – compiled by Aubrey Dowson and originally published in 1910. At the time, on both sides of the Atlantic, cookbooks were a popular form of propaganda for the cause, and featured recipes donated by women involved in the movement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/27/cook-like-a-suffragette-fine-dining-from-century-old-political-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unity without clarity is not a route out of opposition.

Enough members recognise that their party took a wrong turn to be wary of the candidate who revs her engine for another ride down the same road. But Corbyn’s charismatic legacy is still powerful enough to forbid his denigration by any would-be successor. It is permissible to admit that Labour lost the election under his leadership, but not to attribute that defeat to his character, actions or beliefs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/labour-new-leader-unite-party-leadership-contest">Continue reading...</a>

In a final, futile attempt at self-preservation, the country’s authoritarian regime had shut down mobile networks and switched off the internet, so reliable news was hard to come by and we didn’t know who would emerge triumphant from what had already been termed Egypt’s “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/28/egypt-cairo-protesters-defy-curfew-elbaradei-mubarak" title="">day of rage</a>”.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/hosni-mubarak-obituary">Hosni Mubarak obituary</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/26/mubarak-fate-haunts-egypt-leaders-dictator">Continue reading...</a>

But should we be so quick to judge?</p><p>The new Netflix show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/25/love-is-blind-netflixs-hit-is-dating-tv-at-its-most-awful-and-compelling">Love is Blind</a> – in which people fall in love and get engaged without seeing each other first – has sparked many questions. These include: shouldn’t these people be in therapy? If looks don’t matter, why are they all so hot? And: what is up with Jessica Batten’s sexy baby voice?</p><p>I can’t take credit for that term: it was actually coined on Twitter last week, and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/k7en3x/love-is-blind-jessica-sexy-baby-voice">written about</a> since. “Sexy baby voice” may sound like an oxymoron, but it is in fact an affectation that a lot of women use. Just look at the clip in which Batten is first shown to be very capable of speaking in a normal adult voice, before just a moment later sounding like she has a tampon in each nostril.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/26/what-is-sexy-baby-voice-sociologist">Continue reading...</a>

The slogan “You either love it or hate it” was conceived in the 90s, but it is a perfect fit for today’s combative climate. Perhaps it is unsurprising, then, that Marmite is having a moment: taking star turns on Michelin-worthy menus and courting controversy in the supermarket aisles with such combinations as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/11/13/iceland-launches-marmite-brussels-sprouts-and-we-are-horrified-8134786/" title="">Marmite brussel sprouts</a>, Marmite pot noodles and Marmite crunchy peanut butter.</p><p>Last month, the spread tapped into another national schism by staging a Twitter-based “Nuterendum” to launch its latest spin-off, Marmite smooth peanut butter. “Now that Marmite smooth peanut butter has landed, it looks like crunchy has some competition,” <a href="https://twitter.com/marmite/status/1216638196089597952" title="">the brand tweeted</a>, calling for the public to vote for either “Team Smooth” or ‘“Team Crunchy”.

Her ink-black hair is pulled into a pert bun behind the most perfectly straight bangs I’ve ever seen. She just finished working out, she tells me, as she leads me past her husband and a trio of friendly spaniels into a spotless kitchen. A squeaky toy appears at my feet; its four-legged owner barks for a reaction.</p><p>“Please,” Eldred-Smith scolds the spaniel.

He’d only tried it on for the first time the night before. “I didn’t have no legs from the beginning of the fight,” he reflected. “In the third round, my legs were just shot all the way through … I knew I didn’t have the legs because of my uniform.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/26/deontay-wilder-blame-defeat-costume-tyson-fury-boxing">Continue reading...</a>
