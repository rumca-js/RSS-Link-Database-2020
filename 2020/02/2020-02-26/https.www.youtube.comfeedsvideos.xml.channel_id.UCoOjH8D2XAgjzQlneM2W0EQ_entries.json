The unique part is that the 21C\u2019s frame is made up of a lattice of 3D printed aluminum nodes connected together with carbon fiber poles. It represents the slow shift from  traditional manufacturing to digitizing manufacturing into software\n\nIt represents the start of the 3D Printing Industrial Revolution\n\nMeet Relativity Space, a startup cofounded by previous SpaceX and Blue Origin employees, they\u2019re working on bringing 3D printing to disrupt aerospace engineering\n\nBacked by big investors like Mark Cuban and Y Combinator, and partnered with giants like the US Air Force and NASA, they\u2019ve created the world\u2019s largest 3D printer to build rockets\n\nRelativity retrofitted a giant robot arm to feed in aluminum wire and melt it on the spot with a powerful laser\n\nSpaceX have already integrated 3D printing in their Dragon spacecraft via their SuperDraco Engines, in which the combustion chambers are fully 3D printed\n\nAnother startup called Launcher has a focus in helping the small satellite market launch more affordably with their 3D printed copper rocket engines\n\nBack in Tabasco, Mexico, 3D printing is also hitting closer to home\n\nTabasco is home to some of the lowest income families in Mexico. This is the site that the startup, Icon, chose to create the world\u2019s first 3D printed housing community. Thanks to their new Vulcan II concrete home 3d printer. The printer itself can build up to 2,000 sq ft in virtually any floorplan faster, with less waste, and at around half of the cost of traditional homebuilding. Icon\u2019s 3D printed homes aren\u2019t just for people living in absolute poverty\n\nDesktop Metal have created a software that uses algorithms to generate the most efficient, strongest design, using the least amount of material\n\nThe biggest thing holding 3D printing back is still costs. Traditional mass production as you produce more goods the cost continues to drop - economies of scale. \n\n\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
