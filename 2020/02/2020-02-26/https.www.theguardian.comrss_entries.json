Not least, this is because of its weird similarity to the <em>folie de grandeur </em>envisaged by the fictional theatre director in Charlie Kaufman\u2019s 2008 film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/may/15/synecdoche-new-york\">Synecdoche, New York</a>, who proposed an entire city block full of actors improvising \u201creal\u201d lives on a 24/7 basis for months and years until the director thinks the resulting dramas are ready to be shown to an audience. This film originated as a conventional biopic of Landau begun in 2006, but which director Ilya Khrzhanovsky repurposed by taking the part-replica of the Moscow institute, built already in Ukraine for location shooting purposes, and then finishing every room inside as an absolutely accurate clone of the research institute. It was filled it with hundreds of actors who lived and \u201cworked\u201d in an ongoing improvisation there for months, cut off from the internet and the outside world, before shooting could begin, showing the many stories generated within this artificial universe. So far, 13 films have emerged from the Dau project, 12 of which were shown last year at an immersive Dau exhibition in Paris.

Americans eat tonnes of chicken every year, unaware of, or unconcerned by, the chemical rinse applied to its pre-cooked carcass. British consumers might also eat chlorine-washed chicken if they had acquired the habit, but since they haven\u2019t the idea is <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-refuses-food-chlorinated-chicken-promise-trump-brexit-terrifying-2020-2?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">unappetising</a>. This is a problem in transatlantic trade talks because US agribusiness wants access to UK dining tables. The politics of serving food prepared to US safety standards is tricky on a number of levels. Alongside chlorinated chicken, the use of growth-promoting hormones and antibiotics in meat production are more tightly regulated in Europe than in many countries that want to export their surplus meat. After Brexit, the UK can abandon EU standards, but if it does so it will find its produce barred from continental markets.</p><p>Eurosceptics call that protectionism, and partly it is. European food safety standards have a scientific rationale \u2013 the idea is that hygiene should be maintained all along the chain, not dealt with at the last stage by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/boris-johnson-must-examine-the-science-of-cheap-food-imports\" title=\"\">blasting</a> microbes with disinfectant. But those rules are bundled up with a system that insulates the sector from global competition. The EU subsidises farmers, recognising how destabilising it would be if a glut of cheap American produce was dumped on their markets. Some Eurosceptics embrace that destabilisation as an economic tonic, others deny it would happen. Pro-leave campaigners advertised cheaper food as a benefit of Brexit, omitting to explain that a price would be paid by farmers. That sleight of hand was easier to accomplish in propaganda than as government policy. The National Farmers\u2019 Union vehemently opposes lowering regulatory barriers to American produce.
