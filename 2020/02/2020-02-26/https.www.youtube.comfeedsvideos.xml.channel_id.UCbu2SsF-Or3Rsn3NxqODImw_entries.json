Adam's daughter Cherry fights alongside her dad by bashing foes with her electric guitar. The latest new character to be revealed is Floyd, a Maori warrior with cybernetic arm that definitely doesn't resemble Jax from Mortal Kombat at all. \n\nThe video above features Floyd, Cherry, Adam, and Axel punching and kicking through the game's first stage, ending in a boss battle against Diva, who pulses with electricity and wields a snake like a whip. Look, Streets of Rage was never subtle. This was our first look at 4's four-player co-op--it supports four players locally, but only two online. \n\nStreets of Rage 4 is headed to PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch in 2020. GameSpot will be covering more games like this at PAX East 2020, so stay tuned for more from the show floor.\n\n#StreetsOfRage4 #GameSpot #PAXEast", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViTRVOKQ-zM", "date_published": "2020-02-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends \u2013 Official System Override Collection Event Trailer", "description": "Discover your true nature in the System Override Collection Event, March 3 -17.

We'll teach you how--starting with Pokemon's stats.\n\nEven if you've played every Pokemon game, there's a good chance you've never played it competitively. That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding--it's worth it, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.\n\nIn the video above, we break down that barrier to entry so you can actually enjoy battling. Part 1 of this mini-series is all about how Pokemon's stats work: species stats, IVs, natures, and the basics of EVs. What do all those words and acronyms mean? This video explains all of them with plenty of charts to make it a lot less intimidating. \n\nIn GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, \"In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place. You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch.\"\n\n#PokemonSwordAndShield #CompetitivePokemon #PokemonDay #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4VeDVk4WAg", "date_published": "2020-02-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Sword & Shield - Zarude Mythical Pokemon Reveal Trailer", "description": "Zarude, the Dark/Grass Rogue Monkey Mythical Pokemon has been revealed!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlfTqqFyFz0", "date_published": "2020-02-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Future of Borderlands 3, Homeworld, and More From Gearbox's PAX East 2020 Panel", "description": "Tune into Gearbox's PAX East 2020 panel where they will break down more about the future of Borderlands 3, Homeworld, and more.

Ori and the Blind Forest possessed an emotional story where the titular character would eventually find the strength within to overcome their dangerous foes and reunite with its closest allies. Blending fast-paced combat and travel mechanics, it made for an exciting and visually stunning journey to dive into, which culminated in a satisfying conclusion that pulled on the heartstrings. \n\nWith the sequel approaching its March 11 release on Xbox One and PC, we had the chance to get some hands-on time with the game. In this gameplay video, we show off the opening of Will of the Wisps, which sets up what's to come in Ori's next adventure. After being separated from their family, and finding them lost in a new world outside of Nibel Forest, Ori must reacquire their skills and take on new abilities to face off against the foreign land's dangers. Along the way, Ori will connect with the Wellspring's many inhabitants, who will come to be Ori's closest allies in the adventure.\n\nThere was a lot to take in from the opening hours of Ori and the Will of the Wisps.
