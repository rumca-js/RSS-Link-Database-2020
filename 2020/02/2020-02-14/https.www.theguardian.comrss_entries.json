Beth Flintoff tells the story of Maria Marten, who was shot in 1827 in the village of Polstead, and buried for a year before her remains were found.

It was well-written and well-delivered, and John Rentoul has posted a link to the full text.</p><p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">Full text of Long-Bailey's speech here <a href=\"https://t.co/4YLXN0DIih\">https://t.co/4YLXN0DIih</a></p><p>In this leadership election, our party needs to exercise the greatest care in who we choose to lead us. Because the British establishment wants to put us into a box. A box that separates us from the people our party was built to represent. Well I will not be put in that box and won\u2019t allow our party to be either. </p><p>Yes, we have to be credible to regain trust with voters but I\u2019m not interested in the definition of credibility used by the media and chattering classes. The only credibility I\u2019m interested in winning is that of the people.</p><p>We have got a government that wants to put us into a box. They want us to be viewed as the establishment. They are laying a trap for us. They would love nothing more for us to go down the route of shiny suit wearing, not rocking the boat too much, not setting out a transformative vision, and trying to scale back our ambitions, so that they can turn round to our communities and say, \u2018They\u2019re part of the establishment.\u2019</p><p>It was also confusing and ambiguous, the final stage of our policy position, because we talked about a people\u2019s vote as a way to resolve the conversations that were happening in our communities, we were going to give people a vote on the final deal. But then when we were asked if we were going to campaign for our own deal, our answer was: [at this point Long-Bailey put on a posher accent] \u201cI don\u2019t know, we will have to see what it looks like, might campaign for remain.\u201d And that was really bad, and it confused a lot of people.</p><p>To deliver our path to power, we need both details and big vision. I do both.</p><p>I\u2019m a details person. I work hard. I don\u2019t slack off. I suppose that\u2019s the benefit of being a working class woman, always having to work twice as hard to show you\u2019re just as good, in fact better, than an upper-middle class man. So yes, I do think it\u2019s time our party had a woman leader.</p><p>My leadership will be far more robust with the media ...</p><p>I\u2019ll not only call that out, I have a plan to deal with it. I\u2019ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won\u2019t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism.</p><p>We aren\u2019t just a different team of politicians in Westminster, alternating power with the Tories. Our party was born out of a movement in communities like mine and many of those we lost in the election. </p><p>To win again, we need to look and sound like it. And it\u2019s our members and our trade unions, on the front line in workplaces and communities, who will make that a reality.</p><p>I\u2019ve learned so much from Jeremy, John and Diane. They helped our party and our movement rediscover its heart and soul. We owe them so much and I thank them for their huge efforts. History will be much kinder to them than today\u2019s media consensus and we mustn\u2019t retreat from that politics.</p><p>But they have done their bit and it is time for a new generation to take us forward.</p><p>In his introduction to the 1997 manifesto, Tony Blair wrote that our party was the \u201cpolitical arm of the British people\u201d. That is what we must become. I believe I can chart the course to get us there. </p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-02-14T12:17:30.051Z\">12.17pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Last night <strong>J</strong><strong>ake Berry</strong> announced that he was leaving the government.
