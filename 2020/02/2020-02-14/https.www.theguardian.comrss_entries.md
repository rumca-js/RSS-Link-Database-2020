## The Ballad of Maria Marten review – joyous play gives life to murder victim

<p><strong>Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough </strong><br />Beth Flintoff rewrites the narrative of the woman killed in the Red Barn, focusing on her wit and ferocity rather than her notorious death</p><p>The history books are rewritten in this luminous, compassionate production about the Red Barn murder in Suffolk. Beth Flintoff tells the story of Maria Marten, who was shot in 1827 in the village of Polstead, and buried for a year before her remains were found. Focusing on her life rather than her death, Flintoff restores dignity to Maria, who became the grim fascination of public gossip after her murder.</p><p>With an all-female cast, the play is unexpectedly joyous. We see the struggles of being a poor woman in the early 19th century – lack of money, contraception and societal worth – but where there is dread, grief and violence, there is also joy, laughter and dance. We get the pleasure of seeing Maria be happy. Elizabeth Crarer plays her with open wit and sharp ferocity; she is both easy to love, and quick to love others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/14/the-ballad-of-maria-marten-review-red-barn-murder">Continue reading...</a>

It was well-written and well-delivered, and John Rentoul has posted a link to the full text.</p><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Full text of Long-Bailey's speech here <a href="https://t.co/4YLXN0DIih">https://t.co/4YLXN0DIih</a></p><p>In this leadership election, our party needs to exercise the greatest care in who we choose to lead us. Because the British establishment wants to put us into a box. A box that separates us from the people our party was built to represent. Well I will not be put in that box and won’t allow our party to be either. </p><p>Yes, we have to be credible to regain trust with voters but I’m not interested in the definition of credibility used by the media and chattering classes. The only credibility I’m interested in winning is that of the people.</p><p>We have got a government that wants to put us into a box. They want us to be viewed as the establishment. They are laying a trap for us. They would love nothing more for us to go down the route of shiny suit wearing, not rocking the boat too much, not setting out a transformative vision, and trying to scale back our ambitions, so that they can turn round to our communities and say, ‘They’re part of the establishment.’</p><p>It was also confusing and ambiguous, the final stage of our policy position, because we talked about a people’s vote as a way to resolve the conversations that were happening in our communities, we were going to give people a vote on the final deal. But then when we were asked if we were going to campaign for our own deal, our answer was: [at this point Long-Bailey put on a posher accent] “I don’t know, we will have to see what it looks like, might campaign for remain.” And that was really bad, and it confused a lot of people.</p><p>To deliver our path to power, we need both details and big vision. I do both.</p><p>I’m a details person. I work hard. I don’t slack off. I suppose that’s the benefit of being a working class woman, always having to work twice as hard to show you’re just as good, in fact better, than an upper-middle class man. So yes, I do think it’s time our party had a woman leader.</p><p>My leadership will be far more robust with the media ...</p><p>I’ll not only call that out, I have a plan to deal with it. I’ll ridicule the most absurd smears and lies. We won’t just rebut factual errors in stories, but provide a counter-narrative about deliberate media efforts to hold back aspirational socialism.</p><p>We aren’t just a different team of politicians in Westminster, alternating power with the Tories. Our party was born out of a movement in communities like mine and many of those we lost in the election. </p><p>To win again, we need to look and sound like it. And it’s our members and our trade unions, on the front line in workplaces and communities, who will make that a reality.</p><p>I’ve learned so much from Jeremy, John and Diane. They helped our party and our movement rediscover its heart and soul. We owe them so much and I thank them for their huge efforts. History will be much kinder to them than today’s media consensus and we mustn’t retreat from that politics.</p><p>But they have done their bit and it is time for a new generation to take us forward.</p><p>In his introduction to the 1997 manifesto, Tony Blair wrote that our party was the “political arm of the British people”. That is what we must become. I believe I can chart the course to get us there. </p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-02-14T12:17:30.051Z">12.17pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>Last night <strong>J</strong><strong>ake Berry</strong> announced that he was leaving the government.

And it’s not the red balloon or the all-white heart (although fashion people do love the red balloon and the white heart). No, the most chic symbol on the keyboard is the muscly arm emoji with the mega-biceps that suggests itself when you type the word “strong”.</p><p>That emoji is the most on-trend silhouette of the season, a cut-out-and-keep template for your 2020 wardrobe. But don’t panic, because you will not be required to weightlift, nor exist on protein milkshakes. We’re talking Popeye sleeves, not Popeye arms.

## Move over, Rosalía – fado is the new flamenco

<p>Like the Catalan star modernised flamenco, musical duo Lina_Raül Refree are updating traditional Portuguese fado for the 21st century</p><p>For a few glorious moments at the end of January, downtown Los Angeles was enveloped by a whirlwind of Iberian fervour, as Catalan singer Rosalía brought her dazzlingly modern take on flamenco to the Grammy awards. Rosalía, who performed two songs, is the most high-profile exponent of the current flamenco revival. But she is by no means alone, with the likes of Maria Arnal i Marcel Bagés, Niño de Elche, La Favi and Califato 3/4 also offering modern interpretations of the flamenco sound.</p><p>Meanwhile, in neighbouring Portugal, the duo Lina_Raül Refree have forged a bold new take on another traditional music, fado: a deeply melancholic style closely associated with the Portuguese idea of <em>saudade</em>, an untranslatable term defined by scholar Aubrey Bell as “a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably cannot exist”. Even Madonna is getting in on the act: in 2019 she uploaded a fado version of Like a Virgin to her Instagram and has recently been incorporating fado into her live sets. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/14/move-over-rosalia-fado-is-the-new-flamenco-lina-raul-refree">Continue reading...</a>

## Bridge-loving Boris and Dom troll the country, but misjudge the Saj

<p>Regrets, I’ve had a few, but at least I can remember who paid for my holiday</p><p><strong>Monday</strong></p><p>There can’t be anyone in the country who seriously believes that a bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, across one of the deepest, busiest stretches of the Irish Sea that has been used as a dumping ground for millions of tonnes of explosives, will ever be built. And yet Boris Johnson managed to keep an entirely straight face as he announced his intention to proceed with feasibility studies for his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/10/boris-johnson-northern-ireland-scotland-bridge-plan-being-actively-looked-into-no-10">imaginary bridge</a>. Some reckoned this was just a diversionary tactic – on the same day Michael Gove shamelessly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/10/checks-on-eu-bound-goods-inevitable-gove-tells-business-leaders">admitted there would be post-Brexit border checks</a> after months in which the government has brazenly said there wouldn’t – but there is no denying Boris’s attraction to shiny, new infrastructure projects. All of which have a habit of going wrong. When he was mayor of London, there was the Boris Island airport which disappeared under the sea and the Garden Bridge that cost £40m not to even begin construction. It would have been a lot cheaper just to pay me £20m right at the very start just to say the idea was completely ludicrous. Come to think of it make me a consultant on the Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge right now. The country will thank me in the end. Then there are the projects that did get built. The cable car that goes from nowhere in particular to nowhere in particular and is used by almost no one. Crossrail that is massively over budget and three years – and counting – late. So the prospects for HS2, which is already £80bn over budget and spectacularly late even before a mile of track has been laid, don’t seem exactly promising. But thrilled to be writing the biggest cheque in the UK’s history, Boris has given the project the go-ahead. At least, the section up to Crewe. The rest may be later downgraded to regular track; if it gets built at all. Still, by then Boris will be long gone and someone else will be left to pick up the pieces.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/14/bridge-loving-boris-and-dom-troll-the-country-but-misjudge-the-saj">Continue reading...</a>

The world Under-18 200m record holder on juggling studies with athletics, Olympic hopes and the excitement of taking on Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce this weekend<p>Barely a month after her 17th birthday last summer, the British sprinter Amy Hunt ran a 200 metres so fast that her spikes were actually smouldering as she crossed the finish line. And so, emphatically, were the record books. Hunt’s time of 22.42 secs in Mannheim in June not only broke the women’s Under-18 world record – the men’s version is held by a certain Usain Bolt – and was the third fastest ever by a British woman, but it would have also won a bronze medal behind Dina Asher-Smith at the recent world championships.</p><p>“It was 39c that day in Germany and honestly my feet were so hot that my spikes melted a little,” says Hunt, laughing. “It was my overriding memory.

Afterwards I went back and told my coach that I never believed I would run a time like that, but he immediately replied that I did!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/14/amy-hunt-british-teenage-sprinter-record-books">Continue reading...</a>

Within three weeks of the animals’ arrival, visitor numbers to London Zoo doubled, to 16,000 a week. But despite high hopes for the pair breeding, they showed no romantic interest in one another. So, in 1981, they were separated for nine months while Chia Chia, the male <em>(right)</em>, was ferried to Washington on an unsuccessful mating mission. The Guardian photographer Frank Martin was at London Zoo to capture the moment they were reunited at the end of the year.<em>Words: Hannah Booth</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/14/own-a-guardian-classic-photograph-ching-ching-greets-chia-chia-1981">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ruthless quest for gold in eastern Cameroon has left the landscape peppered with deadly open pits</p><p>It was the last day of the summer holidays when, on his way to meet friends in his hometown of Batouri, eastern Cameroon, 12-year-old Saustem Brandon Samba slipped on reddish mud and fell into what at first looked like a large puddle.<br /><br />The puddle turned out to be an abandoned gold mine, with a steep drop, 18 metres deep. Samba tried to get out, his arms and legs scrambling frantically in search of something to grip on to as muddy water choked him.<br /><br />His father, Sah, still carries a photo of his son’s lifeless body after it was recovered from the mining pit in September 2017.</p><p>Between 2017 and 2019, at least 115 children and adults drowned or were buried alive by landfalls in the mostly abandoned pits in the East and Adamawa regions of Cameroon,<strong> </strong>according to <a href="https://forest4dev.org/">Forests and Rural Development</a> (Foder), a local watchdog that is alone in tracking the accidents and deaths. <br /><br />“The whole area was not at all secure,” says Sah, whose fury is clear as he describes how gold mining pits in the region – which locals call “tombs” – have been left open and abandoned by Chinese companies, among others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/14/gold-pits-have-become-tombs-mining-leaves-a-tragic-legacy-in-cameroon">Continue reading...</a>

## Bees and flowers have had the world’s longest love affair. Now it’s in danger | Alison Benjamin

Bees pollinate many human foodstuffs. But intensive farming practices may kill them off if we don’t demand change<p>The oldest love affair in history is between the bee and the flower. It began more than 100m years ago, when nature devised a more efficient way than winds for plants to procreate. About 80% of plant species now use animals or insects to carry pollen grains from the male part of the plant to the female part. The plants developed flowers. Their perfumed scent, colourful displays and sweet nectar are all designed to woo pollinators.</p><p>Over time, 25,000 or so species (we still don’t know exactly how many) of bee have evolved globally to play Cupid to specific flowering plants and trees: their short life cycle perfectly synchronised with the blooming of the flowers. On each visit they refuel with nectar, collect pollen to feed their young and in the process become a messenger of love.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/14/bees-flowers-danger-pollinate-human-foodstuffs-farming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Sweden international on facing Tottenham in the Champions League, having a famous father and those who hate his club</p><p>It was in Aue, a small mountain town near the border with the Czech Republic, that Emil Forsberg fully understood he had got into something a little different. His debut for RB Leipzig had gone badly: they had not expected to lose 2-0 to the struggling local side Erzgebirge and they had certainly not banked on being pelted with snowballs by home supporters at full time, forcing them to run for the tunnel. In the stands two banners had compared his new club to “Nazis” and it was some way for a new arrival from Sweden to receive his first taste of life in Germany’s second tier.</p><p>“That’s maybe when I became a bit more aware that this club was hated here in Germany,” Forsberg says, specifically referencing those icy missiles. There are many who will never accept RB Leipzig’s existence and it stings all the more given that, in the five years since then, their momentum has been virtually unchecked. Forsberg is sitting in a classroom at the club’s training centre and hopes this will be the biggest half-season of his career. Julian Nagelsmann’s side sit second in the Bundesliga, a point behind Bayern Munich and a valid bet to win the title, and on Wednesday will face Tottenham in their first-ever Champions League round of 16 tie. Anyone who hoped they would be short-lived arrivistes is not going to get their way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/14/emil-forsberg-spurs-champions-league-round-of-16-red-bull-leipzig">Continue reading...</a>

I’ve learned that I am a demisexual: a person who doesn’t experience sexual attraction without emotional connection.</p><p>Now I understand why I’ve always been mystified by pornography, and uncomfortable with the idea of casual sex. Friends assumed this was because I was either inhibited or overly moralistic – but I’ve never thought casual sex is wrong in any way; I just can’t understand why anyone would want to have it. For me, sex fits only into the context of an intimate relationship. There is clearly a lot about how sexual attraction works for most people that I have never experienced, and only barely understand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/14/my-life-in-sex-man-who-cant-feel-sexual-attraction-without-emotional-connection">Continue reading...</a>

She is related to a famous former striker; can you identify him? The respective answers – Melanie Reay and her cousin Alan Shearer – may challenge quiz participants outside the north-east, but few who know their women’s football. In the latter circles Reay is instantly recognisable as the gifted and ultra-loyal coach of a Sunderland Ladies side who were summarily demoted two divisions in 2018 when the Football Association turned a revamped Women’s Super League all professional.</p><p>Sunderland had just finished a respectable seventh but, with their parent men’s club hitting financial problems prompted by two swift relegations, they failed to meet the funding criteria required for a licence to play in the WSL or even the semi-professional Championship.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/14/melanie-reay-sunderland-ladies-shearer-cousin-birmingham-fa-cup-wsl">Continue reading...</a>

Pretentious takes many shapes in the eye of the annoyed. It can mean stiff, formal and “reet up itself” to the point of joylessness. That, I’m not a fan of. Life is far too short.</p><p>Pretentious, can, however, also mean eccentric, incomprehensible, wilfully weird and wholly unique.

Every so often, his wife, Wahiba, stands up from the couch at the sound of her husband’s computerised voice. “Eyes, please,” is a request to soothe his eyes with sterilised pads.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/14/pone-paralysed-producer-making-music-with-his-eyes">Continue reading...</a>
