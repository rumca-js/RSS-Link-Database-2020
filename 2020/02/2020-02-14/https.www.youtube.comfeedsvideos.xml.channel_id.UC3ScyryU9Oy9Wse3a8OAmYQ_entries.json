We\u2019re treated as part of the data stream,\u201d one former employee says in the above scene from \"Amazon Empire: The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos.\" \n\nAlso in this scene, Jeff Wilke, one of two CEOs under Bezos, strongly defends the company\u2019s treatment of workers and its commitment to safety. He stresses that the company has become an industry leader in training its workforce for career advancement, and says its hourly workers -- for whom Amazon\u2019s minimum wage is double the federal standard -- are offered the same benefits Amazon executives receive. \n \n\u201cThese are great jobs,\u201d he says.\n\nFor the full story, watch \"Amazon Empire: The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos\" in full starting Tuesday, Feb. 18 at 9/8c on PBS and online: https://to.pbs.org/2SH9uSj\n\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\r\n\r\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \r\n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
