For eons, nature has relied on photosynthesis as a big way to keep carbon dioxide levels from getting out of control. But as we have put more carbon into the air, we\u2019ve also cut down many of the forests we need to suck that carbon up. So big tree-planting initiatives like #TeamTrees to the rescue, right? Actually, we need to think bigger. Here\u2019s three ways trees really can help us solve climate change, from a guy who wants to plant a TRILLION trees, to how we might save the forests we\u2019ve got, to scientists hacking biology to make trees even better. \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/3waystreescansavetheclimate/home\n\nAspect Science: Team Trees Explained https://youtu.be/SLHCA-hHx4Y \n\nSpecial thanks to Felix Finkbeiner\nhttps://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/home \n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\nAlecZero\nBob Rosset\nBrent M.\nDiego Lombeida\nRon Kakar\n\n-----------\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PX1Rc0xlUpk", "date_published": "2020-02-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
