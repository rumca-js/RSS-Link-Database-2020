Snazzy Labs launched a video about Margaret last yearâ€”our rescued server that has a 336TB capacity and we use to edit video live over the network via 10 gigabit ethernet. It's been super amazing, but while redundant, it isn't a backup so we're adding Edith to the mix: an i7 Mac mini that communicates with an LTO-8 tape drive made by mLogic.
