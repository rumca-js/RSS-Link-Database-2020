Black-cab drivers lean on their steering wheels for support; one holds his head in his hands. The last passenger on a static number 8 bus hovers by the doors, hoping forlornly that the driver will release him into the streets.</p><p>In the few visible cars, there are no-smoking stickers that identify them as rides for hire.

The other is Jeremy Heere, whose brain is “gonna freakin’ explode” while “waiting for my porno to load”, in the trippy sci-fi caper Be More Chill, which opens at the Other Palace in London this month.</p><p>These anxious adolescents’ nervous navigation of the school corridors have a lot in common – and so do both shows’ routes to success.

<p>Formed after a free punk concert in 1980, an influential collection of musicians, artists and film-makers including Pedro Almodavar exploded punk counterculture in Madrid – and changed their nation for ever<br /></p><p>General Franco had been dead for a while before those he repressed in Spain felt brave enough to celebrate in public. The dictator’s four-decade rule did not neatly expire in 1975, when he died. The country was still being effectively run by soldiers and priests when a ragged lineup of young punks staged a free concert at Madrid Polytechnic on 9 February 1980. Forty years later, that night is remembered as the event that launched La Movida Madrileña, a countercultural eruption in the city during the country’s volatile “transition” to democracy.</p><p>The show was put together as a rock’n’roll memorial for José Cano, a drummer in the band Tos, who had been killed in a car crash. His bandmates, soon to re-form as Los Secretos, invited friends and peers to play, including Nacha Pop, Mermelada, and Alaska y las Pegamoides – the latter fronted by a 17-year-old girl. Alaska, AKA María Olvido Gara Jova, would become perhaps the biggest icon of La Movida. None of them looked like good Catholics. Their songs sounded insolent, anti-romantic, aggressively secular.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/11/la-movida-madrilena-spain-post-franco-anarchists-alaska-pedro-almodovar">Continue reading...</a>

## Golden Goal: Pajtim Kasami for Fulham v Crystal Palace (2013) | Will Unwin

<p>A Van Basten-esque chest and volley – with the midfielder’s weaker foot – was a masterclass of instinct and execution</p><p>“Wow! Bloody hell!” exclaims Pajtim Kasami as he watches back his volley for Fulham against Crystal Palace six years later. It is the goal the Switzerland international’s time in England will be remembered for.<br /><br />Full-back Sascha Riether was situated just inside his own half when he saw Kasami make his run. Riether chipped the ball to the edge of the box, where the midfielder controlled it with his chest before immediately volleying, while still on the move, over Julián Speroni and into the top corner from the right-hand side of the area. It was Van Basten-esque in terms of its execution – with his weaker foot – but with the added joy of intelligence to sprint into position and control it perfectly.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2019/feb/16/golden-goal-steve-mcmanaman-for-liverpool-v-celtic-1997">Golden Goal: Steve McManaman for Liverpool v Celtic (1997)</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/11/golden-goal-pajtim-kasami-fulham-v-crystal-palace-2013">Continue reading...</a>

## Murrayfield atmosphere reflected rising noise, bile and spite in rugby union | Robert Kitson

<p>Six Nations sees respect jettisoned for ill-feeling, as evidenced by Eddie Jones’s name-calling and fans jeering goalkickers</p><p>Few sports tread the fine line between love and hate as precariously as rugby union. It is part of its attraction: beauty and the beast occupy the same arena, passion and restraint are essential requirements. What has traditionally bound everything together is the realisation that, ultimately, it is a game that relies not only on the “rugby” for its enduring appeal but the collective power of “union”.</p><p>Essentially it boils down to a single word: respect. The code used to be simple: regardless of the intensity of the contest, be respectful to the referee, your opponents and the game itself. Increasingly, though, rugby is drifting in the opposite direction. Abusing the goalkickers, gesticulating at officials, booing players from a rival nation off the bus and blaming the media have become an all-too familiar part of the Six Nations backdrop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/murrayfield-atmosphere-rising-noise-bile-spite-rugby-union-six-nations-england-scotland">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest in a Guardian Print Shop <a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture">series</a> featuring classic sports images. This shot of the legendary Diego Maradona was taken by Mark Leech in 1987</p><p>When Diego Armando Maradona joined Napoli in 1984, 70,000 people flocked to see him arrive at the San Paolo stadium, scarcely able to believe that one of the greatest footballers alive had chosen to join an unsuccessful side from an impoverished part of Italy. Maradona would eventually gift unprecedented riches to Napoli, leading them to a first Scuddeto in their history in 1987, among other achievements, and was dubbed the ‘God of Naples’. This beautiful picture distils the euphoria of that period and recognises Maradona as the leader of his adopted people. However, the good times didn’t last. Asif Kapadia’s riveting 2019 documentary, constructed from over 500 hours of never-before-seen footage, recounted how Maradona became conflicted by his involvement with the mafia. A 15-month punishment for using cocaine and the scandal of fathering a baby, whom he refused to acknowledge as his own, ultimately saw him exiled from Napoli in disgrace. Maradona wasn’t God after all; he was human.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/11/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-maradona-the-god-of-naples">Continue reading...</a>

He is, he says, “angry about the injustice that is allowing the most vulnerable people in the world to suffer from the actions of the richest and most powerful”. So Brindle, who is preparing for his A-levels in Devizes, Wiltshire, decided to do something. On top of his studies, he founded a campaign group, Teach the Future, which has spent the last few months formulating legislation entitled the climate emergency education bill. The latest version has just arrived in his inbox: it has been written by a professional parliamentary draftsperson, paid for by crowdfunding.</p><p>“We didn’t want our demands to be half met, so we thought we’d show them exactly what we want,” says Brindle. Hiring an experienced drafter was a nifty move to quash any notion that young people’s ideas are unworthy of serious consideration. Brindle hopes the bill will be taken forward by the government, “or it could be a private members bill”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/11/pupils-draft-climate-bill-anxiety-lack-guidance-schools">Continue reading...</a>

Beat the winter blues by pumping light into your ears! If that sounds like a convincing proposition, this iPod lookalike will be right up your street<p>Human Charger sounds like a doofus American sports position, but this week’s product is even harder to understand. I am holding a small battery-powered device from Finland that exactly resembles an iPod Shuffle (remember them?), down to the wired buds to wear in my ears. It doesn’t play music; instead, the buds emit very bright LED light. Billing itself as “sunlight on demand”, <a href="https://european.humancharger.com/product/humancharger-europe-silver/" title="">the Human Charger</a> works on the notion that light pumped into the brain “keeps winter blues at bay, increases mental alertness, reduces jet lag symptoms and gives you energy whenever you need it”. It’s literally a bright idea. I plug in, and wait to see the light. Or rather, not.</p><p>The makers are sensitive to scepticism. Their website has a page of dull-looking scientific corroboration, topped by a bald statement in 250-point type: “Main takeaway: the human brain is inherently sensitive to light.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/11/the-valkee-human-charger-can-30-blind-mice-really-be-wrong">Continue reading...</a>

## My boyfriend and I enjoy sex marathons – but is 11 times a day too much?

<p>We both have extremely high sex drives, so are well matched. But I worry we might be damaging our bodies</p><p><strong>My boyfriend and I both have extremely high sex drives</strong><strong> – it’s the</strong><strong> only relationship </strong><strong>for both of us where</strong> <strong>we’re matched in this way. We recently passed 10 times in 24 hours, beating our personal best of eight.</strong> <strong>On our </strong><strong>11th attempt,</strong><strong> it was too painful to go on.</strong> <strong>I</strong> <strong>have searched </strong><strong>for advice on how to either make it hurt less or how long I should take to recover in</strong><strong> between, in case that could be </strong><strong>contributing to the pain. </strong><strong>Is it </strong><strong>possible that I am</strong> <strong>just doing too much for my body?</strong>.</p><p>Sex is supposed to be pleasurable. If it hurts, stop (unless of course you like that – my advice here is not for those who eroticise pain). Nor is sex a competition, or a game of prowess. Take care of your bodies, and consider aspiring to quality of sex rather than quantity. You will have far more satisfying sex if you focus on the giving and receiving of pleasure. Goal-orientedness always diminishes enjoyment. Try to relax together and breathe. What is the point of having bragging rights if your genitals are red-raw? But if you are both intent on some level of achievement, make your goal purely to increase your pleasure levels – which will involve taking far more time to reach orgasm. Attempt just one amazing lovemaking session spread out over 24 hours – always stopping if either of you becomes sore – and you will see why instant gratification is grossly overrated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/11/my-boyfriend-and-i-enjoy-sex-marathons-but-is-11-times-a-day-too-much">Continue reading...</a>

But with care and forethought it is often possible to prevent the rupture</p><p>When David Matcham and his wife adopted a baby boy in 2013, their financial situation promptly hit rock bottom. Matcham, 44, from Norfolk, had just completed a PhD, and was looking for work. They were broke; poorer than either of them had been at any point in their lives, even when they were students.</p><p>For more than a year, Matcham became a social recluse. In part, this was out of necessity – he had no money for socialising – but it was more than that. His sense of self-worth was in the red. “I felt as if I didn’t matter any more, I had made such a mess of things,” he remembers. The anxiety around his finances was all-consuming. Matcham didn’t feel he could confide in his friends because he was ashamed. “My main fear was that they would think I was asking them for money,” he says. “I was just too embarrassed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/11/the-wealth-gap-how-changing-fortunes-tear-close-friends-apart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For decades, one company has ruled the world of tampons. But a new wave of brands has emerged, selling themselves as more ethical, more feminist and more ecological.<br /><br />By Sophie Elmhirst</p><p>The Queen of Tampons, one of several nicknames, is a jubilant woman called Melissa Suk. Four years on the throne as the associate brand director of Tampax, Suk holds court at the head office of the multinational consumer goods giant Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) in Cincinnati, Ohio. From there, she oversees an empire spanning 70 countries, filling bathroom cupboards in cities, towns and villages across the globe. When it comes to tampons, Tampax is the undisputed overlord, with a 29% global market share. (P&amp;G’s nearest rival in the sector, Johnson &amp; Johnson, still has less than 20%.) Last year, more than 4.5bn boxes of Tampax were bought worldwide. And yet, somehow, there are still corners of the earth untouched by Tampax. If your potential territory is all of the world’s bleeding vaginas, there is always opportunity for further conquest.</p><p>On a recent chilly afternoon, I met Suk, beamed in from Ohio on to a giant screen in a meeting room in P&amp;G’s European headquarters in Geneva. The multinational occupies a vast white block with blue glass windows, a design best described as hospital chic. Perhaps because the conglomerate owns so many cleaning-product brands, every surface had an antibacterial gleam and every staffer appeared to have just passed through a delicates cycle, shining with corporate hygiene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/11/tampon-wars-the-battle-to-overthrow-the-tampax-empire">Continue reading...</a>
