It shows that some things change faster over time. You could apply it to life expectancy. Or compound interest. Or any number of things. But especially population growth. Back in 1798, a guy named Thomas Malthus noticed that not everything grows this way. And this caused people to worry because they were sure it would lead to massive death and starvation and famine. But that didn\u2019t happen, thanks to something called the Green Revolution and a guy named Norman Borlaug. As we face a future population of ten billion and a world impacted by climate change, how will we do a Green Revolution 2.0? #GatesPartner \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/cansciencefeed10billionpeople/home \n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\nAlecZero\nBob Rosset\nBrent M.\nDiego Lombeida\nRon Kakar\nvincbis\n\n-----------\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HdMtR5AkQ8", "date_published": "2020-02-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
