This error arose from Graviton being a player with less information online and thus I assumed the person who showed up on google image results with his name in the search bar was him.\n\n-The \"vox\" political party might hold extreme views (I'm not entirely familiar), but Luz also stated that he only supported their economic policies\n\n-No, I didn't misspeak, GDQ DID raise a whopping $300,000,000 and ended up curing cancer.\n\nRevisiting the controversial climate surrounding Games Done Quick, this time with a little help from my speedrunning friends. Cheese, SHiFT, and Bonesaw all helped contribute to this video by sharing their thoughts with me in eye-opening interviews. I discovered gaming, perfectionism, social isolation, and mental health, and children's card games all play a prominent role within the speedrunning community.\n\nBonesaw577's channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChCdy_9rqr8chm_hSDog5yA\n\nCheese's channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UClvMduw1MDMQ0PuH753-X\n\nSHiFT's channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9Y0uUKJ5y78QbhHbntAyFQ\n\nTriHex's channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/trihex\n\n\nMy stuff:\nPATREON - https://www.patreon.com/Glink \nTwitter - https://twitter.com/GlinkLive\nReddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/glink/\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/glink_between_worlds/\nDiscord - https://discord.gg/AMMpS5c", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OclBKRQvwCQ", "date_published": "2020-02-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
