Raccoon City has never looked more terrifying! Check out our side-by-side comparison of the original 1999 title vs the 2020 remake.

Capcom is drastically reimagining Resident Evil 3 with its upcoming remake of the two-decade-old PS1 original. Early footage gave us brief glimpses of Jill, Raccoon City, and Nemesis. Recently, we got a new in-depth look at the remake's version of several iconic scenes, characters, and enemies from the original. 

In the video above, we compare both the original and remake, giving you a side-by-side look at the differences between the two. You can see in greater detail how RE3 remake interprets enemies like Nemesis, Hunter Gamma, Drain Deimos, as well as locations like the substation and Raccoon City itself. There's a lot more, too, so definitely watch it the whole way through. 

You can expect to play RE3 remake on PS4, PC, and Xbox One on April 3. If you're interested in our impressions about how the game is shaping up so far, check out our video discussing our experiences playing the game for two hours.

We break down everything we saw during a two-hour demo of Resident Evil 3 Remake, the upcoming reimagining of the survival-horror classic.

Resident Evil 3 remake is fast approaching, but there’s still a lot unknown about the reimagining of the the over two-decade-old classic. GameSpot editor Matt Espineli got two hours of hands-on time with the game at a preview event, and you can see his impressions in the video above.

So far, the game's shaping up to be a terrifying return to Racoon City. Matt details how the game has evolved and changed this time around, from the more open environments to the increase in the action. And of course, he encountered Nemesis, who he feels is even more terrifying this time around.

Resident Evil 3 remake releases on PS4, PC, and Xbox One on April 3. If you’re interested in how the remake compares to the original game, check out our gameplay comparison video or Matt Espinelli's in-depth article at GameSpot.com!
