## LA Dance Project review - molten moves from the dynamic dozen

<p><strong>LA Dance Project <br /></strong>In Benjamin Millepied’s piece I Fall, I Flow, I Melt, mostly performed to Bach, the dancers sparkle like sun on the ocean</p><p>On the edge of the Los Angeles Arts District, the home of Benjamin Millepied’s company has an exterior somewhere between unprepossessing and unnoticeable. But beyond the barbed wire and the scrappy black facade is a superb squad of a dozen young dancers who could never be overlooked. They bring presence, technique and abundant personality to this full-evening work, first seen here in a slightly different form last year. It’s just a shame that the performances, which sparkle like the sun on the ocean, are unfavourably bookended by grandiose sequences that jar with the night’s more playful and soulful spirit.</p><p>The dancers share their headquarters with a hip art gallery and their performance space is similarly minimal, with wooden beams, exposed brick walls, diffused lighting and a few rows of bleachers for the audience. The gallery’s current exhibition presents sections of broken vehicles studded with pink jewels so that they resemble enormous chunks of watermelon. But the opening tableaux of Millepied’s <a href="http://ladanceproject.org/new-events/2019/1/12/bach-studies-6ang9-l7cpc-5kx6l-653dn-rjzez-zan5d">I Fall, I Flow, I Melt</a> couldn’t be more at odds with the contemporary art world, as the dancers enter solemnly to recreate scenes of suffering and crucifixion by the old masters, with hands either palmed in prayer or covering their eyes, to the accompaniment of Bach’s St Matthew Passion. Bodies are carried, cared for and comforted until all 12 have finally fallen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/24/i-fall-i-flow-i-melt-review-la-dance-project">Continue reading...</a>

Handing control of Britain’s entry this year to a record label is a daringly anti-democratic response to years of abject failure<p>Asked why Britain struggles so badly at the Eurovision song contest, Abba’s Björn Ulvaeus made it sound simple <a href="https://www.smoothradio.com/artists/abba/bjorn-ulvaeus-eurovision-2020-interview/" title="">in a recent interview</a>. It was, he said, a question of finding “the right songwriters”.</p><p>Yes indeed. But what might seem straightforward for Mr Ulvaeus has become horribly complicated for the United Kingdom, which has underperformed in the competition to a startling degree for more than 20 years. Britain’s last victory came in 1997, with Love, Shine a Light <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=katrina+and+the+waves+love+shine+a+light&amp;oq=katrina+and+the+waves+&amp;aqs=chrome.3.69i57j0l7.424195j1j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" title="">by Katrina and the Waves</a>. Years of failure and sometimes outright humiliation followed, most famously in 2003, when Jemini finished last with no points at all. Last year Michael Rice fared little better, scoring a miserable 11 points and also finishing at the bottom of the pile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/24/the-guardian-view-on-eurovision-2020-dont-blame-the-public">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Why is the opposition wasting its time with this tortuous leadership election, rather than holding the government to account?</p><p>If a week is a long time in politics, the Labour leadership contest is stretching across eternity. There are two contests – one for leader and one for deputy – and we won’t know the result until April. Why can’t the deputy just be the one who comes second? What a gigantic waste of time this is while havoc is being wreaked by a government that feels no one will hold it to account. It feels that because it is true.</p><p>This is a radical moment for the Tories, and Labour has met it with timidity. If, after this election, the party does not realise that speed is a virtue in a fast-changing world, it stands in quicksand. It is not self-flagellation to ask what went wrong; it is self-flagellation to keep saying the same stuff at a considerably slower pace. Yes, this government is ripping up the rulebook and, no, it doesn’t see any need to appear on establishment shows such as Today or Question Time, just as I don’t see any need to listen to them. Whingeing about this is a weird preoccupation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/24/the-tories-have-turned-radical-while-labour-stands-still-and-self-flagellates">Continue reading...</a>

Other lingerie brands have embraced less prescriptive beauty ideals and diversity. Victoria’s Secret is scrambling to keep up<p>Victoria’s Secret seems to be having a change of heart. The lingerie brand’s Instagram, typically a stream of pink underwear and mainly white waifish models, looks different: the models are racially diverse and smiling, the colours are calming and autumnal, the lingerie is styled in a noticeably looser way.

Talking about Toby Young. Just like he wants us to. He’s done it again.

Wearing your pyjamas to work, showing your bra or doing your buttons up wrong once meant you probably got dressed in the dark. Now they are exciting new looks<p>My experience of getting dressed in the morning is often tempered by the fact that the lighting in my bedroom is terrible. I often put on trousers the wrong way round, socks are mismatched and T-shirts inside out. I’m not alone. Many of us have similar tales of wrongly sized bras and jumpers on inside out. But on the catwalk it’s a different story. In the season-after-season hamster wheel of reinvention, anything goes. Take the Fendi show last week in Milan, in which models sported headbands upside down on the back of their heads. It makes you wonder what else you could have been wearing wrong for years.</p><p>The fashion website Man Repeller recently featured a piece about “reverse layering”, which recommended styling hacks including wearing a skirt over a dress, denim shorts over swimming trunks and a lace bra over a man’s shirt. Meanwhile, the New York label <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2020-ready-to-wear/proenza-schouler/slideshow/collection#2" title="">Proenza Schouler recently showed models wearing “misbuttoned” jackets</a> and Gucci continued the trend <a href="https://www.vogue.com/fashion-shows/fall-2020-ready-to-wear/gucci/slideshow/collection#11" title="">for reappropriating BDSM harnesses as tops</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2020/feb/24/the-upside-down-headband-why-back-to-front-dressing-is-the-latest-fashion-trend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I felt stuck in a dull but cushy career. When I left it, my limitations and inhibitions seemed to drop away – and I found creative satisfaction</p><p>Three years ago, I felt stuck. Life was a monotonous routine dominated by work and fitting in the odd bit of fun around it – my job was no longer fun. I was in my 10th year at the same retail company, having switched from working in shops to a communications role at head office. It was my job to inform people about the business for the staff magazine, and although my title was reporter, I felt more like a PR person promoting the company to its own employees. It was good experience but work felt corporate and stuffy. I had been there too long and worried that I would never leave, although that I was dissatisfied.</p><p>Eventually this feeling of disaffection began to seep into other areas of my life. I struggled to find purpose and, especially, creativity. The lack of both ate at my mind while I contemplated what to do about it. I had thrived on creative expression since I was young and writing was my strongest outlet. A short story about a talking hamster written when I was eight – to critical acclaim from my mother and my primary teacher – was as far as my creative writing career went. But as a journalist, I longed to write about other people’s creativity in the arts and culture. That desire endured but lay dormant. I feared it would become extinct as I lacked the confidence to apply for jobs in the field due to my lack of experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/24/the-one-change-that-worked-i-quite-my-boring-job-for-university">Continue reading...</a>
