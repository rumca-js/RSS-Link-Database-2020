Snazzy Labs makes a case for a smaller, modular Mac; a Mac Pro mini. The Mac Pro is great and all, but its $6,000 starting price point and "one-size-fits-all-pros" approach means its financially out of reach for many of us mere mortals. But rather than turn to hackintosh land, why couldn't Apple just make a smaller ATX or mini-ITX sized Mac Pro miniâ€”one with the same upgradable RAM, CPU, GPU, and more for less money and in a smaller case? Snazzy Labs takes a look at the new NZXT H1 mini-ITX SFF case. With a built-in AIO, SFF PSU, and PCIe riser card for the GPU, this case is ready to rumble from the factory. Just insert your mini ITX motherboard, attach the cooler, plug-in the pre-wired cables and insert your GPU. That's it. You're done. The whole build takes less than 10 minutes. Pretty freaking awesome for what are historically nightmarish cases to build in.
