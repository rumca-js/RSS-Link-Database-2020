<p>Set in a Zootropolis-style republic, the story of an odd-couple pair of secret agents quickly runs out of animal magic</p><p>Here’s a manic, soulless animated kids’ caper, with a hug-a-hippo message for our eco-anxious times awkwardly bolted on. It’s a Chinese-French coproduction, combining James Bond spy gadgets with some superheroish action sequences that parents might find too bashy for pre-schoolers. Older kids may get the feeling they’ve been better entertained by fresher and funnier movies.</p><p>Like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/zootopia-zootropolis-zoomania-review-disney">Zootropolis</a>, the setting is an animal republic whose citizens have curbed their dietary requirements to live in harmony with one another. Top spy Vladimir, a flashy cat in aviator shades (voiced by Kirk Thornton), is demoted to working security detail at a power station after wreaking havoc while arresting a mafioso cheetah. Vlad’s boss at the spy agency, an enormous elephant, gives him the hairdryer treatment. “You’ve made this agency look like a terrorist organisation!” he bellows. Here and elsewhere, the humourless dialogue feels oddly unattuned to its young audience. Over at the power station, Vlad meets his new colleague, a geeky rat called Hector (Dino Andrade). When thieves attack, the pair fail to stop them making off with radioactive material. Can this odd couple work together as a team to discover the identity of the gang?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/12/spycies-review-childrens-animation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A medic’s heartbreaking personal account of the loss of her father, and of witnessing the courage of the critically ill</p><p>Part-way through this memoir of hospice medicine and living with loss,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/25/doctor-rachel-clarke-dear-life-interview" title=""> Rachel Clarke</a> lists a few troubling ideas she prefers to avoid thinking about: global warming, far-right populism, email overload, menopause, declining numbers of bees and, of course, mortality. It’s become a truism that western societies have difficulties accepting death, but Clarke, whose daily work is to ease the suffering of the dying, has a different view. She sees sense in avoiding the contemplation of death, and often applauds her patients for it – right up until they no longer have any choice.</p><p>It’s a kindness to see death as belonging on the same list as brown envelopes from the government: “Maybe, more prosaically, dying is on a par with tax returns and pensions. We know we should address them all proactively, it is just that the admin involved is, frankly, tiresome.” Only 4% of the population have had the foresight to prepare an “advanced directive” detailing how they’d like to be treated or left in peace should they become critically ill; Clarke would like to see that number increase. Her book has an appendix of websites and organisations that can help. But <em>Dear Life</em> is not a manual for dying, or an orthodox medical memoir – it’s a very personal autobiography. It charts one woman’s trajectory from a happy childhood in rural Wiltshire as the daughter of a local GP, through university, then into a successful career making TV documentaries in London. There’s a Damascus moment in her late 20s when she decides to retrain as a doctor, first in acute and emergency medicine, then finally as a consultant in palliative care.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/12/dear-life-rachel-clarke-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Poor pitches, low wages and conditions far behind the men’s teams’ are common problems – and that needs to change</p><p>The bubble is bursting. Professionalism has pushed the Women’s Super League to new heights, but that growth has stretched to the limit the infrastructures, personnel and, let’s face it, the commitment of those involved in the game’s development.</p><p>Although the postponement of all six games on Sunday was unavoidable, as storm Ciara battered Britain, the scattergun cancellation of eight games before that was not; because the pitches WSL teams play on are, overwhelming, not fit to host top-level professional teams. Birmingham’s home ground, Damson Park, the home of National League Solihull Moors, has seen two games abandoned. Prenton Park, where Liverpool Women and League One Tranmere Rovers play, is a bog and has also seen two women’s games called off. To avoid further chaos Liverpool’s game against Arsenal on Thursday has been moved to Chester. So hard has it been to find a ground for the sister team of the likely Premier League champions that they are resorting to a pitch which straddles the Welsh border, 26 miles from Anfield.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/feb/12/why-wont-clubs-invest-properly-in-their-womens-super-league-teams">Continue reading...</a>

That scene in Little Women, where the sisters stroll arm in arm in wool capes over long dresses, with crisp pie-crust collars and sturdy lace-up boots? That is the exact look that you will find striding over the crosswalks of Hudson Yards or Chelsea to the show venues, five minutes before showtime, at any point this week. (Give or take the odd Starbucks takeout coffee cup, and a few Bottega Veneta bags, obviously. Hey, I’m not in charge of continuity here, OK?) And on the catwalk, capes are already making a strong bid for next autumn’s wishlist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/12/caped-crusaders-how-little-women-lost-the-oscars-but-won-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

## If Boris Johnson really wants to improve the UK’s buses, he should look to Switzerland | Lynn Sloman

<p>Local authorities need greater powers, such as those enjoyed by the Swiss, if the prime minister’s £5bn pledge is to help</p><p>Finally, after decades of disastrous, or at best feeble, bus policy, Boris Johnson’s pledge of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/10/johnson-plans-5bn-boost-for-bus-services-and-cycle-routes" title="">£5bn to improve buses</a> suggests that at long last the importance of this neglected mode of transport is being recognised. The prime minister said in parliament that there would be more services, including at evenings and weekends, and simpler, cheaper and more convenient fares, as well as more bus lanes and zero-carbon buses. But while £5bn could build quite a lot of bus lanes, it will not have much impact on fares and services unless it is accompanied by countrywide regulation of local public transport.</p><p>In 1985, control over Britain’s buses passed from local authorities to private companies. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_deregulation_in_Great_Britain" title="">Deregulation</a> meant that instead of local authorities planning the bus network, private bus operators could decide where and when to run buses, based on which routes were most profitable. It was supposed to lead to an improvement in services, and an increase in the number of people travelling by bus. The Conservative government at the time said that “without the dead hand of restrictive regulation, fares could be reduced on many bus routes and the operator would still make a profit. New and better services would be provided. More people would travel.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/12/boris-johnson-billions-buses-5bn">Continue reading...</a>

It is exhausting. Everyone is in crisis mode.

<p>As the sleep economy grows, online companies vie to sell us new mattresses, offering 100-day returns. This has helped create an impossible waste mountain – and a wild west of rogue recyclers</p><p>Mike Scollick and Richard Allsopp are talking about the worst things they ever found in a mattress. “We had one where I think a dog had been lying on it, and the whole thing was just jumping with fleas,” Allsopp says, shuddering. No one would touch it, so they had to use a cherry picker to move it. But that’s not the worst of it, Scollick says: “I stripped the cover off one once and it looked like somebody …” “Died,” interjects Allsopp.</p><p>It’s fair to say you need a strong stomach to be in the mattress recycling game.
