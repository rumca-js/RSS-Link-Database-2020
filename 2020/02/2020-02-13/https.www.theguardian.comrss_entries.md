<p>It’s red, it’s cold, it’s 4bn years old: Nasa data from Arrokoth reveals ‘profound truths’ about the solar system</p><p>Nasa has unveiled details of the most distant object visited by a spacecraft, in observations that could resolve a decades-long puzzle of how the planets first emerged from the hazy dust of the early solar system.</p><p>The ultra-red, peanut-shaped object, called Arrokoth, sits located 1bn miles beyond Pluto in the Kuiper belt, a vast donut-shaped region that is home to thousands of dwarf planets and icy objects. Nasa’s New Horizons spacecraft made a flyby on New Year’s Day 2019, but the extreme distance from Earth means the probe is still beaming back data gathered during the brief encounter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/13/not-just-a-space-potato-nasa-unveils-astonishing-details-of-most-distant-object-ever-visited-arrokoth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Beanz Meanz Heinz’, and now it also means no added sugar. But they mean lots of other things to many of us. Niellah Arboine celebrates the nostalgic memories we have of our favourite tinned legume</p><p>It’s difficult to explain the nation’s fondness for baked beans, yet, after more than 130 years they’re still as popular as ever – beanz most definitely meanz Heinz. Nowhere else do people rapidly slurp up baked haricot beans simmered in a rich tomato sauce for breakfast, lunch and dinner, with the same dedication as we do in the UK.</p><p>Beyond being a national treasure, baked beans are an all-rounder. They’re full of fibre and protein, and they’re moreish without being pretentious. Without the addition of meat or dairy, the hardy tin of baked beans is hands down one of the most convenient vegan dishes there is. And now Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz manages to have 60% less sugar and <a href="https://www.heinz.co.uk/beanz/creationz/product/100185200050/no-added-sugar-beanz" rel="nofollow">25% less salt than your regular beans</a>, all without compromising on that tomatoey flavour.

<p>From that initial cold forkful to just the right amount of cheese, we’ve settled it – this is how you should be enjoying your beans</p><p>Forget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris – the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream; rhyme it with “gone”; certainly not; and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)</p><p>But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/full-of-beanz/2020/feb/13/no-posh-bread-no-fancy-cheese-and-certainly-no-mayo-the-seven-unwritten-rules-of-eating-baked-beans">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Coliseum, London </strong><br />Barbora<strong> </strong>Horáková’s stark and fussy staging of Verdi’s opera lacks subtlety but there is outstanding singing, with Elizabeth Llewellyn a compelling lead</p><p>Chances to experience <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/07/verdi-the-revolutionary-separate-fact-from-fiction">Verdi’s</a> Luisa Miller have been few in London recently, and if you have been longing to <em>hear</em> it, then the Coliseum is the place to go. English National Opera’s cast is notably fine, the chorus and orchestra are on top form, and the performance that Alexander Joel conducts has urgency, breadth and bite, right from the start.</p><p>If you’ve been longing to <em>see</em> it, you might not be in such luck: Barbora Horáková’s busy yet stark production is harder to love. Andrew Lieberman’s white-walled set gets progressively messier as a liberal amount of black paint is smeared around. The chorus, who start off as sinister monochrome clowns, get progressively more “normal”; but the handful of dancers, looking like half-dressed 18th-century Voldemorts, remain distractingly restless. There’s almost no hint of the class aspect to this story of doomed love, and no way to feel even a shred of sympathy for Count Walther, whom we first see doing menacing things involving more black paint and a nearly naked boy delivered in a plastic sheet. More intriguing, if still fussy, is the presence of Luisa and Rodolfo’s child selves, reminding us of the innocence all on stage have lost. There’s humanity in Horáková’s direction, but her insights seem slapped on like all that paint.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/13/luisa-miller-review-verdi-english-national-opera-elizabeth-llewellyn">Continue reading...</a>

Budget cuts in England and Wales have reduced independent oversight – and could lead to serious miscarriages of justice<p>In a case involving a knife attack in 2015 by a group of young people, one of the three victims who were stabbed was carrying a bag containing some of his clothes, which was discovered at the scene. When examined, the bag was found to have some blood on it that contained DNA matching one of the alleged attackers. To the prosecution – and potentially to a jury when the case went to court – the DNA evidence put the defendant squarely in the frame. Fortunately though, the prosecution’s forensic evidence was checked by a scientist employed by the defendant’s lawyer and paid for by legal aid (which is increasingly rare due to budget cuts).</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/may/29/police-cuts-could-see-rise-in-miscarriages-of-justice-says-angela-gallop-forensic-expert">Police cuts could see rise in miscarriages of justice, says forensic expert</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/13/uk-justice-fund-forensic-services-budget-cuts">Continue reading...</a>

He had barely played five minutes as a substitute in the 2017 Community Shield against Chelsea, but Wembley was hardly an inadequate launchpad for a 17-year-old’s career. His older brother, Ricky, knew the achievement’s scale better than anyone and, to both siblings, it felt at once like a moment of attainment and one of departure.</p><p>“He said to me: ‘Reiss, I think you’re on the way to the top now so I can kind of leave you be; you know what you want to do,’” Nelson remembers. For years Ricky had made a mission of keeping Reiss’s focus on football, which was no easy task for anyone growing up in south-east London’s Aylesbury estate. You needed talent to come this far, but also the right role models on hand. “Without him,” he says, “I don’t know if I’d be here today doing the good things I’m doing for Arsenal.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/13/reiss-nelson-arsenal-jadon-sancho-whos-better-mikel-arteta">Continue reading...</a>

## Why am I supposed to like gin? It’s just ruined vodka

<p>It’s today’s artisanal craft drink, often marketed by cheery fellas in flat caps. But, to me, gin tastes like musty leaf matter</p><p>Let me confess. I live daily with the fear that, like Hector in Alan Bennett’s<em> The History Boys</em>, I am “not in the swim”. At the great dinner party of life, I’m on the children’s table, a mere spectator of the grown-up fun. This is because, deep breath, I don’t have a favourite gin. Yup, I know. If I were asked at a bar which gin I would like with my tonic, I would only stammer. But that’s only the beginning. The truth is I don’t have a favourite gin, because I hate ALL gin. As far as I’m concerned having a favourite gin would be like choosing a favourite war criminal, only with a greater impact on my life.</p><p>It’s worse even than the time I admitted to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/18/jay-rayner-grown-up-cocktails" title="">not liking a negroni</a>, that cruel and bitter slap of a cocktail, a taste for which is meant to mark you out as a mature sophisticate. Despite all the hype the negroni remains a niche drink. Even if I don’t want to be part of the negroni-drinking gang, there’s surely another gang over there I can go hang out with.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/13/jay-rayner-why-am-i-supposed-to-like-gin-ruined-vodka">Continue reading...</a>

On tour with the man behind ‘Take Five’ ... the definitive biography of one of jazz’s most successful pianists<br /><p>In 1954 the pianist<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/dec/05/jazz-dave-brubeck" title=""> Dave Brubeck</a> became the first jazz musician of the postwar generation to be featured on the cover of Time magazine, infuriating those who felt that this white middle-class Californian had no business taking the limelight from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/21/charlie-parker-julie-macdonald-sculpture" title="">Charlie Parker</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/17/chano-pozo-meets-dizzy-gillespie" title="">Dizzy Gillespie</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/nov/06/get-inside-the-music-the-ineffable-genius-of-thelonious-monk" title="">Thelonious Monk</a>, the true pioneers of an essentially African American music.</p><p>In the decades that followed, Brubeck remained the focus of controversy, even as his quartet’s albums – with their abstract-expressionist cover art by Joan Miró, Franz Kline and Sam Francis – became almost as ubiquitous a fixture in the homes of the upwardly mobile as a hostess trolley or coffee percolator. By the dawn of the 1960s, when “Take Five”, a catchy little number in 5/4 time, was high in the pop charts, regularly requested on the BBC’s Sunday lunchtime radio show <em>Two-Way Family Favourites</em>, he was effectively the public face of modern jazz, even though his genial temperament and settled family life – he was married to the same woman for 70 years – ran contrary to what was generally seen as the idiom’s beatnik tendency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/13/dave-brubeck-life-in-time-philip-clark-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The way in which it has been applied from one year to the next has seemed capricious and unpredictable</p><p>After all this week’s palaver about whether Tiger Roll’s rating would be compressed for the Grand National, and if so by how much, I thought it would be good to seek some clarity on the whole issue of compression. I’ve always liked the basic idea as a necessary means of making the race more fair, but the way in which it has been applied from one year to the next has seemed capricious and unpredictable.</p><p>There is not just the question of how much the top-rated horse should be indulged with a reduced rating, but how many of those below him should be compressed.

<p>Could a bespoke book subscription service break you out of your reading rut or encourage you to explore new genres?</p><p>Heywood Hill bookshop has stood on the same spot since 1936. It inhabits a Georgian townhouse at 10 Curzon Street in Mayfair, London, a blue plaque outside commemorating its most famous employee, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/nancy-mitford" title="">Nancy Mitford</a>. Behind its heavy wooden door, a customer explains that she is visiting the UK from Australia, and would like to speak to someone about the shop’s subscription service. The word has clearly travelled far.</p><p>From chocolate to coffee to beer to grooming products, subscription boxes are big business, and books are no exception. There are countless online companies that ship out a monthly read, some adding artisan teas, hot chocolate, or an adaptation on DVD of the book. But Heywood Hill’s subscription is as bespoke as possible: each package is individually tailored to the reader’s tastes following a conversation between the subscriber and a bookseller. Camille Van de Velde, one of Heywood Hill’s five booksellers, takes me down a rickety staircase into the basement from where the scheme is run. Staff are at work in a series of pokey interlocking rooms, stacking titles on shelves, ready to be wrapped, packed and shipped. They won’t be specific about numbers, but each has hundreds of people to choose for each month, and it has, by all accounts, transformed the business.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/13/tailor-made-meet-the-booksellers-who-are-fighting-back-against-the-algorithm">Continue reading...</a>

It is possible this is a temporary reaction to the UK leaving the European Union, in the same way that independence took a fleeting poll lead in the weeks after the referendum.

## Marc Jacobs mixes mid-century poise with neon pandemonium

<p>Clothes at New York fashion week show were as familiar and comforting as staging was unsettling and bewildering <br /></p><p>Marc Jacobs was scheduled to close New York fashion week with a catwalk show, but he closed it with a party instead. So riotous was his 15-minute Technicolor circus of punk ballet and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelous_Mrs._Maisel">Mrs Maisel-esque</a> tailoring that when the pop star Miley Cyrus made a cameo appearance, strutting in a black bra top while trailing a zebra-striped coat along the catwalk behind her, many in the audience didn’t even notice.<br /><br />Park Avenue Armory, a cavernous cube of 55,000 sq ft, was bare and dim when the event began. The audience were directed to seats at a tight cluster of rackety metal cafe tables in the centre of the room, surrounded by empty darkness on all sides. The only light came from the tealight candles in jam jars on the tables, as if at a late night jazz speakeasy.<br /><br />Suddenly a platinum blonde pixie in a black tunic and tights appeared, kicked and twirled savagely through the tables, and promptly disappeared: Karole Armitage, the 65-year-old avant-garde dancer and choreographer known as the “punk ballerina” when she rose to fame in the 1980s.</p><p>Then there was a chaos of floodlights, and groups of dancers swarmed across the room from all directions, leaping and vogueing. Another door opened, and a slow parade of pastel-clad supermodels began walking solemnly through the chaos, following a perfect line. The juxtaposition of the models’ well-dressed poise against the backdrop of noisy neon pandemonium was a little like watching a troupe of Irving Penn models traverse Tokyo’s Shibuya crossing, or New York’s Times Square, at rush hour.<br /><br />Armitage, who has collaborated with Christian Lacroix and Jean Paul Gaultier in the past, has always choreographed with an eye for fashion. One of her dancers shadow-boxed through the show in buttercup yellow lingerie with long black gloves, another sprinted the length of the room in a duck egg blue pencil skirt and black spike heels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/13/marc-jacobs-mixes-mid-century-poise-with-neon-pandemonium">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Plan to form coalition of developing countries at COP 26 to help support efforts </p><p>The UK is to spearhead a major global crackdown on illegal timber and deforestation, with plans to form a coalition of developing countries against the trade as part of its hosting of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/saving-the-planet-uk-role-vital-if-cop-26-climate-talks-to-succeed">crunch UN climate talks this year</a>.</p><p>Deforestation is a leading factor in rising global greenhouse gas emissions, but many developing nations lack the means and institutions to combat illegal logging and regulate forest industries. The Department for International Development (DfID) will shortly lay out plans to help countries strengthen the rule of law, support the trade in responsible forestry and provide on-the-ground assistance to stamp out illegal logging.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/13/uk-lead-global-fight-illegal-logging-deforestation-cop-26">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A conservation, ecotourism and rewilding project in north-east Argentina is protecting endangered species and giving communities a chance to shape their own futures</p><p>Juan cut the engine and we drifted across Laguna Fernández, its mirror-flat surface reflecting cotton-wool clouds, the silence broken only by the raucous cry of a crested screamer. Soon, a leathery snout emerged from a tangle of grasses, a full set of jagged teeth followed by an unblinking eye. It was the first of many basking yacaré caiman, the crocodilian reptile once hunted for its skin but now protected. For an instant, I caught the eye of a surprised marsh deer as it tiptoed across a floating island to drink from the lake, but before I could grab my camera it was gone.</p><p>The Iberá estuaries – <em>iberà</em> means shining waters in the indigenous Guaraní language – form one of the world’s largest freshwater wetlands, covering around 13,000 sq km in the Corrientes province of north-east Argentina. This wilderness, where floodplains, Chaco grassland and subtropical forest converge, is home to more than 4,000 species of flora and fauna, including more than 360 species of birds. Two decades ago it was under threat; now, it’s one of South America’s pioneering conservation and ecotourism projects.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/13/rewilding-eco-adventures-argentina-ibera-wetlands-conservation">Continue reading...</a>

## Cheese and quizzes: my simple secrets for the perfect dinner party

A new study shows a tablecloth significantly improves people’s experience of a meal. But did they test the effect of a red wine sorbet?<p>Remember that dinner party you once had, where everyone raved about your food and lingered at the table late into the night? Did you ever wonder why that happened? Did you think it was your conversational A-game, or your marvellous croutons? It was actually (according to researchers at the University of Hohenheim in Germany) because of the tablecloth. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950329319305282?via%3Dihub" title="">They write</a> in the journal Food Quality and Preference, that there’s a pronounced improvement in the overall meal experience and suggest that tableware may help in places where appetite has to be teased out, such as care homes and hospitals.</p><p>There are all kinds of visual cues that change behaviour around eating. People in dark corners of restaurants eat more calories, because they are less embarrassed to order unhealthy food when no one can see them. Give or take the opposable thumbs, we’re all just dogs hiding under duvets and thinking no one can see us. Heavier cutlery makes us appreciate the food more. Classier glassware boosts our opinion of the drink. There’s probably already someone drilling into why a tablecloth would matter so much, what trick it plays on the rocky relationship between eyes and stomach; I, however, already know why. It speaks of effort. It’s actually not very much effort, so as a host you’re getting a lot of bang for your buck here. You will look like a person who is taking things pretty seriously, has thought ahead, tried to approximate a restaurant’s sense of occasion – and if your friends don’t appreciate this on some important level, and don’t reflect in their own behaviour how glad you obviously are to have them, then you deserve some new friends. My own tablecloth, incidentally, is among my most prized possessions: a friend from Bolivia got it hand-painted with little dancing people in national dress. It can’t even be handwashed without threat to the tiny people, and nobody in south London would know how to repaint the costume of Bolivia, so when I bring this out for you, I really am saying you’re the most important person in my life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/13/cheese-and-quizzes-my-simple-secrets-for-the-perfect-dinner-party">Continue reading...</a>

## Enduring love: how greetings cards are surviving the smartphone era

<p>The British have been sending cards since Victorian times – and still send more per head than any other nation. But can their popularity see off the threat of constant texts and emojis?<br /></p><p>For Rachel Hare, it all started with dental surgery and Bugsy Malone. When she was four years old, the greetings card designer had to go into hospital for an operation, and – because in those days parents weren’t allowed to stay overnight – sobbed as she watched her family walk away. “But they left this massive Bugsy Malone card on my bed – I’ve still got it in a box,” Hare says. “It gives me goosebumps remembering that.”</p><p>In 1994, Hare founded her luxury card company <a href="https://www.bellybuttondesigns.com/" title="">Belly Button</a> and today her designs are sold in John Lewis and Selfridges, among other independent shops. In 25 years of card-designing, she has seen a lot of change. That “pink/blue boy/girl thing” for newborns? On its way out. Valentines are less popular than ever, although the rude variety are<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10944561/naughty-valentines-day-cards-sales-are-up-but-do-they-really-work/" title=""> reportedly on the rise</a>, while thanks to modern masculinity, Father’s Day has boomed. A couple of years ago prosecco was a common motif; now, it is all about gin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/13/enduring-love-how-gen-z-saved-the-greetings-card">Continue reading...</a>

## How ultra-processed food took over your shopping basket

<p>It’s cheap, attractive and convenient, and we eat it every day – it’s difficult not to. But is ultra-processed food making us ill and driving the global obesity crisis? </p><p>By Bee Wilson</p><p>Nearly three decades ago, when I was an overweight teenager, I sometimes ate six pieces of sliced white toast in a row, each one slathered in butter or jam. I remember the spongy texture of the bread as I took it from its plastic bag. No matter how much of this supermarket toast I ate, I hardly felt sated. It was like eating without really eating. Other days, I would buy a box of Crunchy Nut Cornflakes or a tube of Pringles: sour cream and onion flavour stackable snack chips, which were an exciting novelty at the time, having only arrived in the UK in 1991. Although the carton was big enough to feed a crowd, I could demolish most of it by myself in a sitting. Each chip, with its salty and powdery sour cream coating, sent me back for another one. I loved the way the chips – curved like roof tiles – would dissolve slightly on my tongue.</p><p>After one of these binges – because that is what they were – I would speak to myself with self-loathing. “What is wrong with you?” I would say to the tear-stained face in the mirror. I blamed myself for my lack of self-control. But now, all these years later, having mostly lost my taste for sliced bread, sugary cereals and snack chips, I feel I was asking myself the wrong question. It shouldn’t have been “What is wrong with you?” but “What is wrong with this food?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/13/how-ultra-processed-food-took-over-your-shopping-basket-brazil-carlos-monteiro">Continue reading...</a>
