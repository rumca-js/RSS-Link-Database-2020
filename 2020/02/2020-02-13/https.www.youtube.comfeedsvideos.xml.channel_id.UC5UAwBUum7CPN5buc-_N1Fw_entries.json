As its name indicates, its a long term support version, which will be supported for 2 years. It should be included in all major distros that ship a KDE variant, and it comes with a bunch of new stuff, so let\u2019s take a look !\n\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\nFollow me on Twitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\n\nThe Plasma desktop has seen a bunch of improvements to its general usability in 5.18. The first thing is the disappearance of the top right \u201cedit\u201d menu. It was honestly pretty confusing and annoying to have it present at all times, so it\u2019s been replaced by a simple right click on the desktop, and selecting \u201cCustomize layout\u201d. This action brings up Global edit bar, on top of the screen, and it lets you access your widgets, your activities and the whole desktop layout options.\n\nThe system tray widgets have received a lot of love. A new one allows you to toggle night colour, which shifts the tones of your screen from blue to red to avoid too much blue light emission at night. It supports keyboard shortcuts as well if you want to set some.\n\nThe audio volume widget has been redesigned to be more simple and make it easier to change the audio source, and applications playing audio now sport a volume indicator in the task manager. Clicking on it allows you to quickly mute the app.\n\nSmaller adjustments have been added all around, like in the weather widget, which now shows the wind speed as well, or the Kickoff menu, which has been made more touch friendly and uses circular icons for profile pics.\n\nMore notifications are now available as well, for example when a bluetooth device get to the end of its battery life, or file download notifications which allow you to quickly drag the file from the notification to where you want to store it.\nThe big one here is the new user feedback. Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s all disabled by default, it\u2019s an opt-in way for plasma users to give some feedback to the developers. It\u2019s very granular, and lets you choose how much data you\u2019re willing to share. In all cases, no personal information is ever sent to the plasma team, so you can crank that up all the way without risking any of your privacy, and the collected feedback will be used to improve plasma and identify the areas the developers need to focus on.\n\nIn the settings, the application styles window has been revamped with the grid view that permeated most of all the appearance settings. It makes it easir to look at the various themes and select the one you want to use. The grid view has also been applied to the global themes browser, so when you\u2019re looking to download global themes to change your whole desktop\u2019s look, you\u2019ll be able to see a lot more accurately what the result will be.\n\nWindow animations are also now easier to tweak, with a slider allowing you to control the animation speed.\n\nThe search feature in the settings has also been improved, since it now filters as you type. This is a very nice improvement: KDE has often been roasted for offering too many options and making the settings unreadable, but this basically negates that concern: typing what you\u2019re looking for is more intuitive than browsing through a list of categories trying to guess where the setting you want to tweak is located.\n\nThe major improvement is how KDE integrates with GTK applications. It now correctly supports client side decorations, which is about every GTK app using a headerbar these days. These didn\u2019t display shadows before and the resize handles were inconsistent. It\u2019s all in the past now, and these apps should look a lot more at home on a plasma desktop, apart from the fact that KDE apps don\u2019t tend to use headerbars and sport menus and toolbars.\n\nGTK applications should also inherit the plasma desktop\u2019s settings for their theme, the icons they use, the mouse cursors, so they will be a lot better integrated with the system. It\u2019s nice to see a bit more interoperability, since consistency in a desktop is important, and it\u2019s not the user\u2019s job to know which toolkit an application uses and if that toolkit is well supported on their desktop environment or not.\n\nIn Discover, Plasma\u2019s package manager, the search field is now focused by default, so once you open it, you can immediately start typing and looking for what you need. It\u2019s a small improvement, sure, but all in all, discover has outgrown its infancy issues and is shaping up to be a lot more reliable and user friendly than it once was.\n\nPlasma should also perform better while using your GPU, and fractional scaling will now cause a lot less visual glitches. Nvidia GPUS are also included in the system monitor, so you can check a few stats on your graphics card.\n\nA new emoji picker has also been added. You can bring it to front pressing Super + period.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHcdTut5Y1A", "date_published": "2020-02-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
