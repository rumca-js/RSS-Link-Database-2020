It's almost out and we got a taste of it at the PAX East 2020 show floor. Granted, Animal Crossing is all about living your in-game life over the course of days, weeks, and months, but the demo let us check out a little bit of the crafting system, the new Able Sisters shop, and the expansive museum.\n\nThe crafting system has gathering specific resources to construct the necessities like the fishing rod or vaulting pole, but also new pieces of furniture to deck out your house. To craft items, you'll need to go to the shop run by Timmy and Tommy Nook. The Able Sisters shop lets you browse for new outfits and you can dress yourself with pants, shirts, socks, shoes, hats, and glasses--it's the deepest fashion has gotten in Animal Crossing. The museum was especially impressive, now including a biodome for all the bugs you collect, an aquarium for all fish you catch, and wide open showcase for all the fossils you dig up. The PAX East show floor demo also allowed for four-player couch co-op where friends can hop on and explore your island with you.\n\nAnimal Crossing: New Horizons launches on Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020. We have you covered from several angles, so be sure to check out our video on 19 things new for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, some impressions from our recent hands-on preview, and our pre-order guide if you're already planning your virtual island getaway.\n\n#AnimalCrossing #NewHorizons #GameSpot #PAXEast", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJzbHaEENgo", "date_published": "2020-02-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Battle Strategies - Competitive Pokemon Explained Part 2", "description": "Now that we\u2019ve laid the groundwork with stats, it\u2019s time to talk strategy. Here are some competitive battle tactics that every trainer should know in Pokemon Sword and Shield.\n\nEven if you've played every Pokemon game, there's a good chance you've never played it competitively. That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding--it's worth it, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.\n\nIn the last video we broke down how a Pokemon\u2019s stats are laid out. In Part 2, we dig into how battling works: abilities, speed and priority, weather, shutting down strong attackers, and much more.\n\nIn GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, \"In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place.
