The 2019 Elizabeth Banks reboot of Charlie's Angels with Kristen Stewart and Princess Jasmine and the other one didn't go so well. Not only did it flop bad enough to end the franchise, it also got quite a bit of heat from audiences, mostly because of its relentless transfixion with being a female driven movie like Wonder Woman or Captain Marvel. In today's family friendly episode of Anatomy of a Failure, let's see how this film was so obsessed in its gender related agenda that it inadvertently managed to ruin itself. If you're planning to make a female driven action movie, here's what to avoid. Now let's just wait for Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow.
