The steps you need to take, the various obstacles, the risk of wiping your disk, everything leads to questions and doubts. The choice can also be overwhelming. This video series aims to help people willing to switch, take their first steps. We\u2019ll start by listing the steps you need to watch to ensure the transition goes well, and move on to how to choose a distro, actually installing it, and how to get help if something goes wrong.\n\n\nSet up your own Linux server with LINODE: http://www.linode.com/linuxexperiment\n\n\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\n\nFollow me on Twitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\n\n\nMoving to Linux doesn\u2019t imply any technical or coding knowledge, nowadays, but you still need to take some precautions first. You\u2019re going to be messing with your SSD or your hard drive disk, so some amount of care is required. The obvious first step is to backup your data. \n\n\n\nCheck your components online\nCheck what your computer has inside before trying out Linux. Most motherboards, processors, hard drives and SSDs will work out of the box, no questions asked. Graphics cards aren\u2019t an issue anymore: for AMD users, the open source drivers are perfect. For Intel users, everything is already supported as well. For Nivida users, you\u2019ll just need to install the proprietary driver to make sure you get the full potential of your card. What you need to look for is your wifi and bluetooth modules. Check the model numbers, and look them up online with the keyword \u201cLinux\u201d, to see if people report errors, or have solutions to make them work.\n\n\nChoose a distribution\nFor those of you who are not familiar with Linux at all, a distro, or distribution, is basically a \u201cversion\u201d of a Linux based OS. What we call Linux is not a single unified operating system as Windows or Mac Os. it\u2019s an ensemble of the Linux kernel, the GNU tools, a display server to allow to have a graphical interface, and a desktop environment and applications. For Beginners, Ubuntu or Fedora will work for stability, and Manjaro will do the job if you want bleeding edge. You can then pick the desktop environment you want to use: GNOME for simplicity, KDE for super high customization, Cinnamon for an intermediate mix, and XFCE if you want something lightweight.\n\n\nCreate a live USB\nGenerally, what you need to do is download the distribution you chose, and put it on a USB key with a dedicated tool. Most distros are provided as an ISO image file, what was used to burn optical disks.To put that image on a USB key, all you need is Etcher, a very simple tool that will let you select the ISO itself, the USB key, and click \u201cgo\u201d.\n\n\nBoot from the USB key\nThis means starting up your computer using the USB key as its hard drive, instead of using your computer\u2019s own SSD or Hard drive disk. It\u2019s generally an easy process, but you might need to get into the BIOS or EFI interface to tell your computer to try booting from a USB key instead of the disk it uses.What you\u2019re looking for is \u201cboot options\u201d, or \u201cboot sequence\u201d. You just need to tell your computer to use the USB key instead of the hard drive, generally by changing the boot order and putting your USB device above your hard drive.Once that\u2019s done, you\u2019ll have to save these settings, often it\u2019s a press of the F10 key. Your computer will reboot, and if the USB key is plugged in, it should start up using it as its hard drive.\n\n\nTry out the distribution\nJust test everything you can think of: is the resolution OK, is wifi and bluetooth working, are all your peripherals recognized and working: webcam, microphone, trackpad, mouse, keyboard, audio jack, printer, the various ports\u2026 Take some time to really put the distro through its paces, and try everything. You\u2019re running a live session, which means anything you do on here won\u2019t be saved when you next reboot, so go crazy!\n\n\nInstall the distribution\nMost Linux distros have a graphical, easy to understand installer. The most common cases are: wiping out the whole disk and replacing everything with Linux, or dual booting, Most installers will provide an option to dual boot, if you prefer to keep a Windows or Mac OS X partition, and will let you decide how much space to give to your Linux partition. The installer will ask you to enter a username, and a password. Remember that one carefully, cause it\u2019s the one used to log you in, and to do anything that requires admin rights, like changing some settings, or installing programs.\n\n\nReboot\nAt reboot, depending on your distribution of choice, and if you elected to dual boot or not, you might see some kind of ugly screen listing the operating systems installed. It\u2019s called Grub, and allows you to pick what system you want to boot, or boot on older linux kernels to solve eventual problems with an update.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ro6IWsT3uRk", "date_published": "2020-02-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
