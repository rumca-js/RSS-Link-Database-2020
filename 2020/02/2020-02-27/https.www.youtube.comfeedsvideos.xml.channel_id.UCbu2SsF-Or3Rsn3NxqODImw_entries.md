Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the next entry into Nintendo's carefree life-sim. It's almost out and we got a taste of it at the PAX East 2020 show floor. Granted, Animal Crossing is all about living your in-game life over the course of days, weeks, and months, but the demo let us check out a little bit of the crafting system, the new Able Sisters shop, and the expansive museum.

The crafting system has gathering specific resources to construct the necessities like the fishing rod or vaulting pole, but also new pieces of furniture to deck out your house. To craft items, you'll need to go to the shop run by Timmy and Tommy Nook. The Able Sisters shop lets you browse for new outfits and you can dress yourself with pants, shirts, socks, shoes, hats, and glasses--it's the deepest fashion has gotten in Animal Crossing. The museum was especially impressive, now including a biodome for all the bugs you collect, an aquarium for all fish you catch, and wide open showcase for all the fossils you dig up. The PAX East show floor demo also allowed for four-player couch co-op where friends can hop on and explore your island with you.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons launches on Nintendo Switch on March 20, 2020. We have you covered from several angles, so be sure to check out our video on 19 things new for Animal Crossing: New Horizons, some impressions from our recent hands-on preview, and our pre-order guide if you're already planning your virtual island getaway.

Now that we’ve laid the groundwork with stats, it’s time to talk strategy. Here are some competitive battle tactics that every trainer should know in Pokemon Sword and Shield.

Even if you've played every Pokemon game, there's a good chance you've never played it competitively. That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding--it's worth it, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.

In the last video we broke down how a Pokemon’s stats are laid out. In Part 2, we dig into how battling works: abilities, speed and priority, weather, shutting down strong attackers, and much more.

In GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, "In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place. You're not held back by overly complicated back-end systems or hoops to jump through; from the outset, you can start wandering the Galar region, seeing its new Pokemon, and trying out its new battle strategies with very little in your way. This leaves you free to enjoy what Pokemon is all about, and that makes for an incredibly strong showing for the series' proper debut on Switch."

Streets of Rage 4 brings back retro heroes Axel, Blaze, and Adam, but they're not the only playable characters in the new beat 'em up. Adam's daughter Cherry fights alongside her dad by bashing foes with her electric guitar. The latest new character to be revealed is Floyd, a Maori warrior with cybernetic arm that definitely doesn't resemble Jax from Mortal Kombat at all. 

The video above features Floyd, Cherry, Adam, and Axel punching and kicking through the game's first stage, ending in a boss battle against Diva, who pulses with electricity and wields a snake like a whip. Look, Streets of Rage was never subtle. This was our first look at 4's four-player co-op--it supports four players locally, but only two online. 

Streets of Rage 4 is headed to PS4, Xbox One, PC, and Nintendo Switch in 2020. GameSpot will be covering more games like this at PAX East 2020, so stay tuned for more from the show floor.

Want to learn how to battle competitively in Pokemon Sword and Shield? We'll teach you how--starting with Pokemon's stats.

Even if you've played every Pokemon game, there's a good chance you've never played it competitively. That's because competitive Pokemon has a high barrier to entry, and there's a lot you need to know just to start battling. That said, competitive battling is exciting and incredibly rewarding--it's worth it, and Sword and Shield are a great place to get started.

In the video above, we break down that barrier to entry so you can actually enjoy battling. Part 1 of this mini-series is all about how Pokemon's stats work: species stats, IVs, natures, and the basics of EVs. What do all those words and acronyms mean? This video explains all of them with plenty of charts to make it a lot less intimidating. 

In GameSpot's Pokemon Sword and Shield review, Kallie Plagge wrote, "In collecting, battling, and exploring, Sword and Shield cut out the bloat and focus on what makes these pillars of the Pokemon games so captivating in the first place.
