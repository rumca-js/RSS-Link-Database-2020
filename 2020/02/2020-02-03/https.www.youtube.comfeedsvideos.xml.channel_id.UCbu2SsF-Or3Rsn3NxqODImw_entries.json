So before Kings Canyon comes back, Revenant and the Sentinel get added, and Ranked mode changes once again, let's look back at the year that was.\n\nIn the video above, Jordan Ram\u00e9e talks through Apex Legends' 12 months of history, from its surprising launch to the start of Season 4. Apex Legends has seen massive growth in that time, with the wildly popular Season 2: Battle Charge and complete map change in Season 3: Meltdown. It hasn't been all positive though--Season 1: Wild Frontier struggled to offer a reason for players to keep coming back and the Apex Legends community was not happy over the Iron Crown Collection event loot box controversy. \n\nDespite all of these changes, however, Apex Legends continues to be as enjoyable a game to play as it was at launch. In GameSpot's Apex Legends review, Phil Hornshaw gave the game a 9/10, writing, \"Apex Legends is a mix of smart shooter ideas that makes for a competitive, team-based game that gets at all the best parts of battle royale while addressing a lot of the weaknesses. Respawn's intense focus on team play makes Apex more than just a worthy addition to the genre; it's an indicator of where battle royale should go in the future.\"\n\n#ApexLegends", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkzgVc9Gi8U", "date_published": "2020-02-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends Season 4 Is Live Today!", "description": "Today, GameSpot Live takes on Apex Legends: Assimilation!
