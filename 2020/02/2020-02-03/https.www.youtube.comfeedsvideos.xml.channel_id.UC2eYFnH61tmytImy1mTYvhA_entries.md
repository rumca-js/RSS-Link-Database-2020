Ever wanted to start a public online presence? It's easier than you think. You don't need no fancy studio or Pajeets who do your video editing. Just do it and stop making excuses. I take a trip down memory road and talk about my old apartment with a broken toilet where I recorded my first videos.

Videos I mentioned here:
