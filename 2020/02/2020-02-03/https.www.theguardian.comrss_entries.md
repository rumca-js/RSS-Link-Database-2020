<p>Waleed Zuaiter stars as an out-of-favour cop forced into a risky pact, in a thrilling drama that puts Iraqi lives front and centre</p><p>After seven seasons of Homeland, it’s nice to see an Iraq war-set thriller that centres on Iraqi lives for a change. Nice because it’s the right thing for a socially conscious broadcaster to commission, but also just nice because it makes for some refreshingly original entertainment.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/baghdad-central" title="">Baghdad Central</a> (Channel 4), Waleed Zuaiter stars as Inspector Muhsin al-Khafaji – an experienced but out-of-favour Baghdad cop who is forced into a risky collaboration with the occupying forces when his eldest daughter (Leem Lubany) goes missing, and his younger daughter (July Namir) requires kidney dialysis. You may recognise Zuaiter from Sex and the City 2, where he was the souk-trader stereotype who tried to cajole poor, innocent Charlotte into buying knockoff designer gear. Or perhaps you know him better as the terrorist from various post-9/11 action-dramas including London Has Fallen and Homeland. Either way, it is likely you won’t have seen him in a role that does justice to his star quality and soulful eyes the way this one does.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/baghdad-central-review-more-than-just-a-middle-east-morse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a stranger-than-fiction new docuseries, an FBI investigation into a decade-long scheme to fix the McDonald’s Monopoly game is revealed</p><p>It was always a crime story hiding in plain sight. From 1987 to the 1990s, McDonald’s crowned dozens of winners in its promotional Monopoly game, which awarded customers prizes ranging from a free drink to a car to a million dollars. Big-time winners – the rare ticket-finders – were interviewed on the news and profiled in the papers. Except none of the winners were real. Or rather, none actually stumbled upon a lucky ticket. They were picked in a scheme run by a rogue ex-police officer, Jerome Jacobson, involving mob connections, false addresses, smuggled tickets and over $24m in illegal winnings – a genuinely crazy, rabbit-hole story of greed, deceit, and good old American scamming explored in McMillions, a six-part HBO docuseries out this week.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/saudi-runaway-documentary-escape-filmed-cellphone">Saudi Runaway: behind a suspenseful and courageous documentary</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/mcmillions-bizarre-story-how-one-man-stole-24m-mcdonalds-hbo">Continue reading...</a>

## Why is Boris Johnson waging war on the EU? To distract from his cuts | Polly Toynbee

<p>The prime minister could have tried to heal the divisions. Instead he’s preparing the ground to blame Europe once Brexit’s damage is clear</p><p>It sounds like war. The thud of the falling pound greeted the prime minister’s tub-thumping speech: it suggested his “great voyage” was destined for the rocks of the hardest of Brexits. Days after proclaiming we would leave with peace, prosperity and friendship, he set out to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020" title="">do battle</a> with those he called our friends and neighbours. Now our ersatz Winston Churchill proclaims he will fight them on our fisheries, fight them on aviation, but above all fight off their filthy regulations. There will be no level playing field on his battleground.</p><p>What’s he up to? This marks a sharp U-turn in political strategy. Only days ago, the message was “It’s done. We won. End of story”, as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/01/brexit-day-one-johnson-pledges-no-concessions-to-eu" title="">beat his mini-gong</a> on the stroke of 11pm on Brexit night and Dominic Cummings wept at his own success. At first the order was never to mention the Brexit word again. Get this trade stuff off the front pages and safely hidden away in business sections. Indulge the euphoria of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/brexit-midsummer-nights-dream-politicians" title="">Brexiteer cheers</a> in Parliament Square and let them believe Brexit really is well and truly “done”.

The Streatham attack has focused attention on courts and prisons once again, but ministers must think before they act<p>It is only natural to feel alarmed following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/03/streatham-attacker-was-under-full-surveillance-from-day-of-release" title="">terrorist attacks</a> such as the one that took place in Streatham, south London, on Sunday, when Sudesh Amman stabbed two people before being shot dead by police. The murderous, jihadist ideology that is assumed to have guided Amman’s actions is frightening. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/03/who-was-the-streatham-attacker-sudesh-amman-and-why-was-he-imprisoned" title="">Details</a> such as his having urged a girlfriend to murder her parents are horrifying. The fact that this 20-year-old man had been released from prison just over a week ago, after serving part of a sentence for possessing and distributing extremist material, makes the sequence of events that led to his death all the more unnerving.</p><p>The similarities between this attack, and the fatal stabbing of Jack Merritt and Saskia Jones by another former prisoner, Usman Khan, at London Bridge, are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/01/khan-attack-will-put-sentencing-and-release-of-terrorists-under-scrutiny" title="">extremely concerning</a>. Episodes of Islamist terrorism have formed malign patterns in the past and are expected to again. In this context it is right that ministers should seek to reassure the public, and show themselves willing to take whatever action is necessary to reduce the danger. The toughest questions must be asked both of the prison service, who released Amman, and of the security services who thought the former prisoner so dangerous that they put armed officers on his tail.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/03/the-guardian-view-on-terrorists-who-reoffend-the-response-must-not-be-rushed">Continue reading...</a>

## We need to get to potential terrorists before radicalisation, not afterwards | Richard Barrett

Once an individual has fallen for extremist propaganda, it’s hard to change their mind. Better to spot the early signs<br /><br />• Richard Barrett is a former director of global counter-terrorism at MI6<p>The attack in Streatham on Sunday carried out by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/feb/03/streatham-attack-sudesh-amman-freed-after-serving-half-his-sentence-live-news" title="">Sudesh Amman</a> – recently released from prison after serving time for terrorist-related offences – raises again the question of how to make prison more effective in dealing with this sort of offender. Inevitably there have been renewed calls for longer sentences and more police on the street.</p><p>Yet evidence from elsewhere does not suggest that this would stop similar attacks. First, no society can be entirely free from terrorism, just as no society can be entirely free from any other form of serious crime. Second, having more police on the street is not likely to prevent the sort of attack committed by Amman, who took a knife from a shop and immediately started attacking passers-by. Indeed in this case, armed police were not only right behind him but watching his every move. Third, there is scant evidence that longer prison sentences lead to lower rates of reoffending. And fourth, no prison deradicalisation programme anywhere in the world has proven consistently successful.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/03/potential-terrorists-before-radicalisation-extremist-propaganda">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Surely the Baftas couldn’t be as bad as they look on TV? The Guardian’s intrepid reporter hit the red carpet to find out</p><p>Not so long ago, I made plans to attend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/oscars">the Oscars</a>. Whenever I mentioned this to people, you could measure their excitement in decibels. They’d scream. They’d shake. They’d generally behave like the extended family of an X Factor contestant who’d just been informed that they had qualified for bootcamp. It was terrifying.</p><p>I never made it to the Oscars in the end. But this year I got another chance to experience the same sort of starstruck hysteria by attending the Baftas. Except things didn’t quite work out that way. “I’m going to the Baftas,” I’d tell people, and without fail they’d sort of screw up their nose in disappointment. If you’ve ever seen a child open a birthday card to discover that there isn’t any money in it, you’ll understand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/03/stuart-heritage-baftas-selfies-scarlett-red-carpet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She studied by day, went clubbing by night – then wrote the house anthem that launched a thousand hen parties</p><p>I fell into club culture in my first year at university in Baltimore. During the week, I’d be in classes, studying medicine. At weekends, I’d be letting it all go in clubs to the sound of underground house. I met the DJ team the <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/279580-The-Basement-Boys">Basement Boys</a> and when they found out I sang in church, we started writing songs.

## Kylie Jenner's lavish party is proof: the children’s birthday bash has got out of hand

<p>Jenner’s celebrations for her two-year-old daughter Stormi included a venue so huge that visitors had to be given maps. But it’s not just celebrities who are spending big on their little ones</p><p>Before we go into the details of the party that Kylie Jenner threw for her two-year-old daughter Stormi at the weekend, let’s remember the function of the late-capitalist celebrity, which is to consume to an outrageous degree. So yes, boggle at the toddler’s celebrations: a venue so huge that visitors had to be given maps; Stormi’s head rendered as a massive inflatable; a claw machine where you could win a little Stormi head pillow. Wonder, perhaps, at what that might do to a two-year-old’s psyche, like a screening of Being John Malkovich, covered in glitter. But Jenner is merely fulfilling her destiny: mega-spender.</p><p>The world at large has no such excuse, and children’s parties have gone bananas. One New York City party planner, Anne Ligeard Murat, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/wealthy-parents-spend-weddings-instagram-perfect-kid-birthdays-2020-1?r=US&amp;IR=T" title="">revealed recently</a> that her basic children’s party package started at $6,000 (£4,600). It is not unusual for the high-net worth parent to drop 50 grand on a sleepover, complete with bespoke soft-play ball pit. A couple recently spent six figures recreating a Parisian scene in Washington – for a one-year-old. Before you even get to the obscenity of excess, the first thought has to be for the lifetime of resentment and dissemblance these families are storing up, as that one-year-old immediately forgets it ever happened, then spends a decade pretending not to have forgotten, before exploding in teenage rage: “It’s actually not my fault that I can’t remember it, it’s a function of human memory.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/feb/03/kylie-jenners-lavish-party-proves-it-the-childrens-birthday-bash-has-got-out-of-hand">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joker star Joaquin Phoenix was right to attack ‘systemic racism’ in the film industry, but wrong to even collect his best actor award</p><p>So, Joaquin Phoenix. Great guy, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/joaquin-phoenixs-attack-on-baftas-for-systemic-racism-meets-industry-wide-praise">great speech</a>. Nearly as good as his unhinged dance to Gary Glitter in Joker. Actually, perhaps a little more disturbing because it was real life. Only not that real, as this was the Baftas – yet another awards ceremony where well-rewarded people reward each and laugh at crap jokes, where women are applauded for wearing implausible dresses, where Phoenix himself has made the eco sacrifice of wearing the wearing the same Stella McCartney tux that he will to all the awards ceremonies. Hardly a hair shirt.</p><p>Also, he is vegan and I liked the Joker for all of half an hour. Anyway, it was “brave” to talk about systemic racism. Pretty fly for a white guy because we have all had enough of various windbags telling us that they are not personally racist. From Piers Morgan to Laurence Fox and, yes, Jeremy Corbyn on antisemitism. Anyone who says they haven’t got a racist bone in their body needs an X-ray.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/03/joaquin-phoenix-baftas-speech-racism-boycott-suzanne-moore">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kim Little was sorely missed for Arsenal while poor refereeing and the state of pitches in the WSL were hot topics</p><p>A nervy, pressurised game in Manchester ended up with City victorious and Arsenal’s title hopes hanging by a thread. Joe Montemurro’s side are now outsiders in the race after losing to their nearest rivals in quick succession, and they badly missed Kim Little on Sunday. She did not even make the bench, presumably due to a knock, and it meant their link from back to front was badly disrupted. Vivianne Miedema became isolated as a result and, with Lia Walti’s absence in front of the back four also keenly felt, a lack of strength in depth was exposed again. They rallied after going two goals down but, one fine save apart, Ellie Roebuck was not tested often enough in the City goal and they will have to find a way to recover from this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/03/womens-super-league-talking-points-from-the-weekend-action-football">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘The rapist is you!’: why a Chilean protest chant is being sung around the world

Devised by a little-known South American feminist collective, the song, Un Violador en Tu Camino, has been performed by women from Washington to Istanbul. Why has it captured people’s imagination?<p>The rhythm is infectious, the crowd of women exuberant as they pump their fists and move their feet. Their voices rise as they chant the chorus line, translated from the song’s original Spanish: “It wasn’t my fault; not where I was, not how I dressed.” How many women wouldn’t guess, from those words alone, that this is about rape? And it is that visceral, shared understanding that has helped a song and dance, devised by a little-known Chilean feminist collective called Las Tesis, spread across the globe. Since November, Un Violador en Tu Camino (A Rapist in Your Path) has been sung everywhere from France and Mexico to Kenya and India as a protest against the systemic use of sexual violence to repress women. Most recently, it was performed outside the New York courtroom where Harvey Weinstein is on trial for rape.</p><p>Like the pink pussy hats or The Handmaid’s Tale-style scarlet cloaks adopted by other feminist protesters, the spectacle is easy to copy and highly shareable on social media. But its real power lies in how it feels, not how it looks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/03/the-rapist-is-you-chilean-protest-song-chanted-around-the-world-un-iolador-en-tu-camino">Continue reading...</a>

Plus: Iman Amrani on modern masculinity</p><p>The Iowa caucuses tonight are the first staging post in the long road to the Democratic party’s nomination process for the presidential candidate who will run against Donald Trump in November’s election. Voters will assemble in town halls in the midwestern state to caucus for their preferred candidate. It’s been described as a game of political musical chairs as voters move around the room coalescing around their favourite candidates. </p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Chris McGreal</strong> has been visiting Iowa for months and has found that Democratic voters are faced with a dilemma: vote for a radical candidate with bold policies or opt for one who polls better among swing voters. Whichever candidate Iowans choose tonight will have a big early advantage: early victories are vital in attracting financial donations as well as giving campaigns forward momentum. But with 49 more states to have their say, this is the start of a gruelling months-long process. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/03/us-elections-the-importance-of-iowa-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
