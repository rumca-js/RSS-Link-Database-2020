As Apex Legends approaches its first birthday--and the start of Season 4: Assimilation--we thought it would be a good idea to take a trip down memory lane and recount the highs, lows, and major changes for Respawn's battle royale over the past year. So before Kings Canyon comes back, Revenant and the Sentinel get added, and Ranked mode changes once again, let's look back at the year that was.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée talks through Apex Legends' 12 months of history, from its surprising launch to the start of Season 4. Apex Legends has seen massive growth in that time, with the wildly popular Season 2: Battle Charge and complete map change in Season 3: Meltdown. It hasn't been all positive though--Season 1: Wild Frontier struggled to offer a reason for players to keep coming back and the Apex Legends community was not happy over the Iron Crown Collection event loot box controversy. 

Despite all of these changes, however, Apex Legends continues to be as enjoyable a game to play as it was at launch. In GameSpot's Apex Legends review, Phil Hornshaw gave the game a 9/10, writing, "Apex Legends is a mix of smart shooter ideas that makes for a competitive, team-based game that gets at all the best parts of battle royale while addressing a lot of the weaknesses. Respawn's intense focus on team play makes Apex more than just a worthy addition to the genre; it's an indicator of where battle royale should go in the future."

A human-hitman turned into a nightmare simulacrum, Revenant has been dealing death for centuries. The return of Hammond Robotics to the Outlands has given him a new target. Now his synthetics sights are set on the company that created him and any Legends who cross his path. Revenant throws out Silence devices to disable other Legends’ abilities and make them easy prey. And with his ability to scale obstacles and crouch-walk with unnatural speed, nowhere is safe. Revenant can even rescue his squadmates from death itself -- as long they’re useful to him. Become a killing machine and teach your foes the meaning of fear.
