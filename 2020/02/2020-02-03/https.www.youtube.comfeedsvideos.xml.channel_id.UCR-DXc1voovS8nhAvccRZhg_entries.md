In this inaugural livestream, I set up a new Drupal project and Git repository for JeffGeerling.com, and show you how I set up a simple local development environment using Docker. I also accidentally cover up my terminal window with my face because it's the first time I've ever done a live stream :)

I will continue doing these live streams every Tuesday, and hopefully end up doing the final live production migration on YouTube soon!

I recorded a time-lapse of my three-room 3/4" hardwood flooring install, and narrated some of the tips and process I used to do it. From ripping out the old carpet and parquet to installing Aquabar 'B' underlayment, nailing a cleat in the middle, installing flooring, reversing the direction with a spline, finishing up the outside edges with a finish nailer, and finally completing the base molding and shoe molding, I have the whole process documented with the help of my little Raspberry Pi-powered timelapse!
