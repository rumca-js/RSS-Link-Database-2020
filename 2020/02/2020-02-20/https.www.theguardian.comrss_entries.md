## ‘It feels like an extra limb’ – musicians on the bond with their instruments

<p>Horrible things happen to instruments in transit – as Ballaké Sissoko and others have recently learned. Five musicians explain why the damage goes more than skin deep</p><p>One thing successful musicians have to do a lot of is travel, and when you travel with an instrument, you increase its chances of getting damaged. Early this month, the Malian musician Ballaké Sissoko’s kora <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/06/malian-musician-kora-ballake-sissoko-dismantled-tsa-us-customs" title="">was taken apart by US border agents</a> when he left New York, something Sissoko only discovered when he picked it up in Paris. A few days later, Louis Levitt discovered <a href="https://www.thestrad.com/news/double-bass-cracked-after-united-airlines-flight/10198.article" title="">a four-inch crack in his $100,000 double bass</a> after it had been unpacked for security screening at Newark airport, and a few days after that, specialist instrument movers <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/11/virtuoso-mourns-beloved-150000-piano-smashed-by-movers" title="">dropped Angela Hewitt’s £150,000 F278 Fazioli piano</a> while removing it from a studio after a recording session, rendering it “unsalvageable”.</p><p>The loss of an instrument, though, is about more than inconvenience or financial cost. It’s about the loss of something that can feel like an integral part of a musician’s being – it’s their means of self-expression. And after years of playing one instrument, simply swapping to another isn’t as easy as it sounds – musicians and their instruments have relationships and losing one can be as hard as losing a lover. Here, five musicians talk about the instruments they play, and what those instruments mean to them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/20/it-feels-like-an-extra-limb-musicians-on-the-bond-with-their-instruments">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lucio Castro’s first film is an explicit romance in which the lovers look the same across two decades. It’s not The Irishman, he says, and he prefers it that way</p><p>All Lucio Castro had in mind when he sat down to write a screenplay was an elegiac title – End of the Century – and a starting point: a figure arrives in a new city, in this case Barcelona. “I followed him around for a while as I wrote,” Castro says. “I thought, he’s new to the place and maybe he’s horny and he meets someone and they have sex and go for a drink and that’s when they realise they’ve met before.”</p><p>So begins a plangent gay love story with hints of Andrew Haigh’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/03/weekend-film-review">Weekend</a> and Richard Linklater’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/16/before-sunrise-sunset-romance">Before</a> trilogy. The dominant mood, however, is elliptical and disorienting: a kind of Last Shag at Marienbad. “There should be something a bit off about the film,” explains the 44-year-old Argentinian director. “I want the audience to doubt what it sees.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/20/end-of-the-century-director-first-gay-men-have-sex-then-they-go-for-wine-and-cheese">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>The Photographers’ Gallery, London</strong><br />From second world war concentration camps to the effects of global capitalism on Parisian youth, this year’s contenders produce moving work that struggles in a group context </p><p>‘The limits of photography cannot yet be predicted,” wrote the German philosopher, Walter Benjamin, in 1928, when the form was new and its potential uncertain. One wonders what Benjamin would have made of the ways in which contemporary practitioners are testing and sometimes, intentionally or otherwise, illuminating the limits of the medium. This year’s <a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibition/deutsche-borse-photography-foundation-prize-2020">Deutsche Börse </a><a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibition/deutsche-borse-photography-foundation-prize-2020">prize</a> exhibition at <a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhPOcz4rg5wIVA7TtCh1dcguREAAYASAAEgLVrfD_BwE">The Photographer</a><a href="https://thephotographersgallery.org.uk/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIhPOcz4rg5wIVA7TtCh1dcguREAAYASAAEgLVrfD_BwE">s’ Gallery</a>, London, is a case in point. It is big on ideas, ambition and creative process, but, for me, oddly underwhelming. </p><p>The most resonant work is the one most haunted by the ghosts of history. Anton Kusters’ The Blue Skies Project is a study in stillness: a flat grid of 1,078 Polaroid images, each subtly different, their apparent ordinariness at odds with their immense symbolism. Over several years, Kusters photographed a small patch of blue sky above the site of every known second world war concentration camp in Europe. Each Polaroid is stamped with a row of numerals that correspond to the GPS coordinates of a camp and the number of people who perished there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/20/deutsche-borse-photography-prize-review-big-ideas-but-the-wrong-place-for-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In two years reputations can be built or destroyed. Uefa’s ban will surely make several of City’s squad question their future</p><p>Manchester City have built an incredible image around the world over the past few years. The City group controls clubs in North and South America, in Asia, Australia and beyond, and Manchester has been the centre of this global empire, a kind of footballing utopia. They have the best manager in the world and they have been winning trophies every year – even their training ground is incredible. It has been an extremely attractive proposition for any footballer and now, suddenly, questions arise.</p><p>There will be some players in the squad who are not that bothered about the loss of European football, who will use Uefa’s suspension to build a siege mentality, an opportunity to show togetherness and collective spirit. But for others the Champions League dream may be over if they do not make a change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/20/manchester-city-uefa-champions-league-players">Continue reading...</a>

<p>People working in this sector play an integral part in maintaining a civil society. That’s not low-skilled work</p><p>It’s been a decade since my first night shift as a care worker. It lasted from 8pm to 8am, but two-thirds of the way through I was ready to walk out. I had imagined it would be like when I was a child and had visited a nursing home with my mother, who was caring for the elderly. It was all custard creams and blankets on the floor by the telly. That first shift was a gruelling wake-up call. I’d had intensive training on how to hoist people from their chairs to their beds without breaking their bones, how to dispense medication, how to prop immobile people up in bed without breaking their wafer-thin skin when they wanted to read, and how to change soiled underwear in a way to preserve the dignity of everybody involved. Yet nothing had prepared me for 12 hours of faeces, tears, urine, screaming, lifting, cleaning, running and sweating.</p><p>I’ll never forget holding a 90-year-old lady for an hour as she sobbed for her mother, who had died decades before, one hand digging into my back and her other hand clutching a teddy bear. I felt like I was contributing to society for the first time in my life, but I was physically and mentally drained. A fortnight after that first shift, I quit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/20/care-work-points-based-immigration">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the latest season, Larry David is accused of sexual misconduct, a scenario which shows the comedy’s strengths and limitations</p><p>Like a bald, tirelessly kvetching Batman, Larry David returns to us right when we need him most. Curb Your Enthusiasm hasn’t graced HBO’s airwaves since 2017, and the last three years have given the people of America much fodder for the withering David touch. The 10th season premiere invoked the name of Trump right off the bat with an inspired plotline involving the infamous red Maga hats. Larry (the character, the man himself heretofore referred to as “David”) begins wearing one upon realizing that it’s a foolproof way to keep friends and strangers alike from interacting with him, the kernel of the gag being that he’d rather be left alone out of scorn than bothered by favor. It’s the essence of Larryism, honed to a single gesture and filtered through the day’s big headline.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/30/metoo-to-maga-curb-your-enthusiasm-is-back-and">#MeToo to MAGA: why Curb Your Enthusiasm is still TV's most daring comedy</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/20/curb-your-enthusiasm-metoo-larry-david">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether it’s Dave and Stormzy castigating the government or Kanye surrounding himself with young Londoners, black artists have expertly capitalised on the visibility of the Brits stage</p><p>The Brits are no stranger to protest or political statement: the 1996 ceremony contained both, with Jarvis Cocker driven to moon Michael Jackson over his sanctimonious environmental-awareness hit Earth Song. In 2014, David Bowie pleaded with a pre-referendum Scotland to remain part of the UK. Katy Perry made giant skeleton effigies of Donald Trump and Theresa May dance on stage in 2017; a year later, a drunk Damon Albarn railed against Brexit.</p><p>But there is something about a new wave of emboldened black British artists taking centre stage and delivering an unambiguously political message that feels far more historic and impactful: not pleas for unity or cartoonish satire, nor traditional rock-star rebellion, but explicit condemnations of Britain’s ongoing history of racism, delivered into the heart of primetime TV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/20/brit-awards-black-politics-dave-stormzy-kanye-west-tyler-the-creator">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They were big in the 80s and now they’re back. But how does this symbol of power dressing go down in 2020? </p><ul><li>Read more from the spring/summer 2020 edition of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/series/the-fashion-spring-summer-2020">The Fashion</a>, our biannual style supplement </li></ul><p>Shoulder pads in the 80s were synonymous with adulthood. That’s how we imagined our selves-of-the-future; standing in a flat with big windows and a martini, maybe with some job (lawyer?), wearing shoulder pads. Oh, and a big telly. The shoulder pad, if you cross-ref it with the rest of the image, was more than womanhood: it was professionalism, modernity, hedonism and power. In their 2020 reboot, some – Balenciaga’s – are more nostalgic than others – Balmain’s. A giant trench in a zingy spring green is pure 1983, whereas a sequinned cloak is a bit more robotic and dystopian. But for anyone of a certain age, they’re what you’d wear if a magic trick made you swap bodies with your mother, à la Freaky Friday, even though your actual mother never wore them because she wasn’t a Sloane, and nor would she have worn giant earrings.</p><p>The 80s didn’t own shoulder pads. In the 30s, they existed purely to make your waist look smaller. This, being much less extreme than wearing a corset or removing a rib, was a pretty tame look, which took a surprising turn in the 40s, when the shoulders merged with military chic and everyone’s silhouette became gigantic and a bit scary, in sartorial homage to the tanks everyone was rolling all over each other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/20/i-took-up-so-much-room-zoe-williams-week-of-wearing-shoulder-pads">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Volunteer work in the worst-affected regions can now count towards second- and third-year working holiday visas</p><p>Britons who plan on taking a working holiday in Australia can now volunteer to help with bushfire relief as part of their application – and be eligible for a longer working-holiday visa. The aim is to direct larger numbers of workers to areas where help is most needed, especially on a long-term basis. The changes come a month on from devastating bushfires <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/feb/11/counting-the-cost-of-australias-summer-of-dread">which killed 33 people</a> and around a billion animals, destroying more than 3,000 homes and 19.4 million hectares since July 2019.</p><p>Prior to the change, travellers had to put in 88 days of paid – usually agricultural – work to be able to apply for a second- or third-year working holiday visa. Also known as 417 visas, these are open to travellers aged 18 to 30, or up to 35 for Canadian, French and Irish citizens. Now, unpaid volunteer work in bushfire-affected areas can count towards the total number of days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/20/new-visa-rules-encourage-backpackers-to-help-in-australias-bushfire-recovery">Continue reading...</a>

While the board had much to say on other topics, including racing’s responsibilities to its horses and the need for a code of practice on euthanasia, it reserved its most urgent comments for the subject of the whip.</p><p>“The overall number of offences (over 500 in 2018) remains unnecessarily high and the current penalties do not provide an adequate deterrent effect,” the board concluded. The HWB does not have power to require action from the British Horseracing Authority on regulatory matters, but the BHA immediately signalled that it would begin a three-month consultation with racing insiders and the public on changes to the whip rules, with a view to deciding on and implementing changes by the end of October.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/20/horse-welfare-board-comments-set-to-usher-in-stronger-whip-penalties">Continue reading...</a>

## Vulva masks and labia serums: the marketing of women’s genital shame

<p>More and more ‘wellness’ companies are selling products that capitalise on women’s insecurities over their bodies. Now they are targeting the vulva</p><p>There is little to love about having a cold, damp vulva. Or so I discovered when I applied an “activated charcoal sheet mask” to mine. The product in question, Blackout, is by a “luxury vulva care” brand called <a href="https://www.twolips.vip/" title="">Two L(i)ps</a>. The company’s promotional material says it is “ready to disrupt and redefine the vulva space”. Before disrupting my own, however, I had to navigate the packaging. After slipping it from its peach-coloured pouch, you have to pull away a sheet of white “lace” to reveal its dark, sopping glory. “Dim the lights and relax as your skin is detoxified and clarified,” say the instructions on the box, which tell you to leave the mask on for 15-20 minutes, then pat the “remaining serum” on to the skin. Lying on the sofa, mortified by my own company, I last no more than six. Of all the mistakes I’ve made in my intimate life, looking down to see that sprawling blackness, its “lace” film lying sadly by my thigh, is definitely up there, so to speak.</p><p>I may be a cynic, but there is a hungry market for these products: Two L(i)ps boasts that 10,000 units of Blackout (£15.50 for a single mask, £66 for a set of five) were sold in the two and a half months after its launch. The brand has developed a range of “luxury vulva care” products including Pout, a “hydrating serum” made of 95% pure hyaluronic acid (£99 for 30ml), and Undercover (£99 for 30ml), an “anti-blemish cream” to “stay spotless”. The cream is made from the skin-whitening agent palmitoyl hexapeptide-36, and comes with the instruction to apply SPF30 sunscreen to the area the following day, no doubt with all that offering-our-naked-labia-to-the-sky sorcery us women get up to in mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/20/vulva-masks-and-labia-serums-the-marketing-of-womens-genital-shame">Continue reading...</a>

To me, they looked like pagans from a Grimm’s fairytale: shaggy woolly gilets, those bells hanging round their waists, and heads adorned with towering flower-covered hats. Exaggerating their gait to make the bells jangle, they shimmied and bumped their hips against each other as they waved carved wooden figures with a somewhat menacing air. Over the course of a 25km procession, they were here to banish evil spirts and herald the coming of spring.

<p>For seven decades, India has been held together by its constitution, which promises equality to all. But Narendra Modi’s BJP is remaking the nation into one where some people count as more Indian than others. By Samanth Subramanian</p><p>Soon after the violence began, on 5 January, Aamir was standing outside a residence hall in Jawaharlal Nehru University in south Delhi. Aamir, a PhD student, is Muslim, and he asked to be identified only by his first name. He had come to return a book to a classmate when he saw 50 or 60 people approaching the building. They carried metal rods, cricket bats and rocks. One swung a sledgehammer. They were yelling slogans: “Shoot the traitors to the nation!” was a common one. Later, Aamir learned that they had spent the previous half-hour assaulting a gathering of teachers and students down the road. Their faces were masked, but some were still recognisable as members of a Hindu nationalist student group that has become increasingly powerful over the past few years.</p><p>The group, the Akhil Bharatiya Vidya Parishad (ABVP), is the youth wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Founded 94 years ago by men who were besotted with Mussolini’s fascists, the RSS is the holding company of Hindu supremacism: of Hindutva, as it’s called. Given its role and its size, it is difficult to find an analogue for the RSS anywhere in the world. In nearly every faith, the source of conservative theology is its hierarchical, centrally organised clergy; that theology is recast into a project of religious statecraft elsewhere, by other parties. Hinduism, though, has no principal church, no single pontiff, nobody to ordain or rule. The RSS has appointed itself as both the arbiter of theological meaning and the architect of a Hindu nation-state. It has at least 4 million volunteers, who swear oaths of allegiance and take part in quasi-military drills.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/20/hindu-supremacists-nationalism-tearing-india-apart-modi-bjp-rss-jnu-attacks">Continue reading...</a>

The 45-year-old has been trying to make himself feel better about the state of the world, and this – weapons of mass destruction primed to annihilate us all – is what he’s landed on. “What’s comforting is that, these days, it’s so far down the hit parade of threats that we barely reflect on it at all,” he continues, before pausing to consider this. “It almost makes me think that there <em>will</em> be a nuclear war – because that’s the thing we’re not focused on!”</p><p>It didn’t take long for Mitchell’s optimism to turn to dread. But then that’s his stock-in-trade: a permanent sense of trepidation. Indeed, he rattles through a list of current terrors – Trump and Putin, the climate crisis, the internet’s grip on our lives – and says it’s all got so bad that he has resolved to stick his head in the sand from now on. “I don’t want to feel perpetual anguish,” he says, “and I’ve decided it’s not my duty to, either.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/20/david-mitchell-film-greed-west-end-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Cuts to domestic violence services, refuges and legal aid have resulted in increased levels of risk for women targeted by men<p>The latest <a href="https://femicidescensus.org/" title="">UK Femicide Census</a> shows that, despite more than 50 years of feminist campaigning against male violence, the number of women and girls dying at the hands of men is increasing. The annual report on such crime in the UK shows that of the 149 women killed in 2018, the vast majority – 91 – died at the hands of a current or former partner; 12 were killed by sons or stepsons; five by a current or former son-in-law. Only nine were killed by a stranger or where there was no known relationship.
