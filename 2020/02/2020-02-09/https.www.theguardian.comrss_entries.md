## Pontus Jansson: ‘Bielsa had bad sides but I learned so much from him’

<p>Brentford defender talks about facing former club Leeds on Tuesday and the pain felt by him and other Malmö fans when Zlatan Ibrahimovic invested in a rival club</p><p>“I think I was almost this tall, 1.94m [6ft 4in] but like 25kg [4st] less,” says Pontus Jansson, smiling as he recalls his previous life as a prodigious striker. For an 18-year-old in the academy at Malmö, whose club crest is emblazoned on his right arm, Zlatan Ibrahimovic was a natural source of inspiration but at the start of a title-winning 2010 season, the defender Jasmin Sudic suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury and Jansson was asked to fill in at centre-back. “I was like ‘no problem’ because I was that proud to be in the first team because it was the team of my heart. I could have been the fifth-choice striker for the rest of my career just to be in that team, that was enough for me at the time.”</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jul/09/pontus-jansson-leeds-needed-money-brentford-bielsa-language">‘They needed the money’: Pontus Jansson explains Leeds exit</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/09/pontus-jansson-brentford-leeds-united-marcelo-bielsa-malmo-zlatan-ibrahimovic">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We all deserve representation': hijab-wearing model Halima Aden on the power of fashion

<p>The first model to wear a hijab on the cover of Vogue, the first to wear a burkini in Sports Illustrated… Halima Aden is used to breaking barriers. Here she talks about shattering stereotypes and using fashion as a force for change</p><p>Halima Aden, then aged 19, became the first contestant in the Miss USA 2016 beauty pageant to wear a hijab and burkini, attracting the attention of French fashion legend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/carine-roitfeld" title="">Carine Roitfeld</a>. The following year she became the first hijab-wearing model to sign with a global modelling agency, IMG, and then the first to walk at New York fashion week, for Yeezy, the Kanye West brand. She later became the first hijab-wearing model to make the cover of <em>Vogue</em> – twice (first <em>Vogue Arabia</em>, then British <em>Vogue</em>) – and soon afterwards a <em>Sports Illustrated</em> swimsuit shoot followed. By that point she’d already become a Unicef ambassador, and a go-to voice on diversity in the fashion industry. In 2017 she gave the first <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/halima_aden_how_i_went_from_child_refugee_to_international_model?language=en" title="">TED</a> talk at a refugee camp in Kakuma, Kenya. <em>Teen Vogue</em> went with her.</p><p>When we meet, at a hotel near King’s Cross, I ask if it ever gets tiring, being the first in so many different ways, shouldering the burden of representation. “Somebody needs to,” Aden says. “I want my sister, my little nieces, even my nephews to see representations of somebody who wears a hijab in modern ways, in such a way that they can relate to.” We’re sitting side by side on a window seat, Aden holding court before a little audience of PRs, management and her best friend, Lizeth, who has travelled with her from the US. Though she looks very much the high-fashion figure, all in black – sequins and brocade lace, knee-high stiletto boots – she seems younger than her 22 years, gabbing away in the stream-of-conscious slang and asides of a teenager still starstruck by the turns her life has taken.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/09/halima-aden-model-activist-hijab-refugee-fashion-we-all-deserve-representation">Continue reading...</a>

## The lost art of having a chat: what happened when I stopped texting and started talking

Every Sunday, when the notification pops up to tell me the hours I have wasted, mostly texting, I think about all the things I could have done. Finished <em>Middlemarch</em>. Started <em>Middlemarch</em>. But as I have my phone in my hand, I scroll through Instagram instead. I send an article or a joke to a friend, a picture of the dog to the family WhatsApp, catch up on someone else’s night out. Recently, I clocked up – and I’m ashamed as I write this – six hours and 29 minutes of phone usage in a single day. I have had days where I’ve barely been awake that long. Messages is my most used app. I am talking all the time.</p><p>But I am rarely <em>talking</em>. For the chatterboxes among us, this is a time of upheaval. The long, spontaneous chat on the phone is going the way of the fax. The percentage of households with a landline that’s used to make calls is declining every year, from 83% in 2016 to 73% in 2019; the number of calls made on house phones plummeted by 17% in 2018 alone. We still use our mobiles to talk – in 2018, Ofcom surveyed mobile users for three months and found only 6% of them never made a single call – but we are not talking in any great depth. The same study found that over 80% of calls were shorter than five minutes, and the majority were under 90 seconds. I looked at my own recent call list: three minutes, two minutes, five minutes at a push. What can you say in that time? You can only make the point you’ve called to make.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/09/the-lost-art-of-having-a-chat">Continue reading...</a>
