That special holiday--created by a greeting card company--where we spend time with the people we love. But you might want to spend it playing video games, so here are some great PC, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PS4 co-op games to play with your significant other or friend and some you should avoid at all costs.\n\nJess covers titles like Portal 2, Army of Two, and Divinity Original Sin 2, as well as games that do not have \"two\" in the title, like the bomb-defusal game Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes, among others. They are each unique and fun games in their own right, but they might not all be the best game to play with your friend or loved one. \n\nWhich ones should you play and which should you avoid? Be sure to watch the full video to get all the important details on how to make the most out of your Valentine's Day (or at least the portion of the day you might choose to play video games!). The video also covers titles like A Way Out, Unravel 2, and Overcooked 2. \n\nLet us know what your favorite co-op game is down in that comment box and leave me your picks for the best and worst games to play with a significant other.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9gQYoERzFI", "date_published": "2020-02-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare \u2013 Official Season 2 Gameplay Trailer", "description": "The War Rages On.\n\nThe fight continues in Season Two of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, free on all platforms on February 11.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkNqXp-FfUo", "date_published": "2020-02-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Revisiting Tenchu: Stealth Assassins From PS1", "description": "Today, Persia and Richie discuss one of GameSpot's recent articles on games that the folks here in the office are currently playing.

Based on our experience with the demo and all the pre-release content we've seen coming from the Japanese release, Persona 5 Scramble is shaping up to be more of a sequel to the original RPG than a spinoff action game. In the video above, we go into detail about our impressions and what we know about the game.\n\nThe story is a continuation of Persona 5 with the Phantom Thieves returning in full form. Everyone's a bit older, Haru and Makoto are in college, and they're all seasoned from their time in the original story. You'll get opportunities to explore the streets of Japan and spend time with your friends all over again, but in new scenarios. There are also new characters like Sophia and the new Phantom Thief codenamed Wolf who are brought into the mix.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, Persona 5 Scramble isn't just a Musou adaptation of the RPG, it's more of an action RPG with the number of elements from the original game are incorporated into the combat. You'll still juggle different personas, cast spells, exploit enemy weaknesses, and execute all-out attacks. The metaverse is going to have new palaces and challenges and it seems that the new action gameplay fits the style its going for.\n\nAll the sights, sounds, and styling of Persona 5 are present in Scramble, and we're excited to see it when it comes out in Japan on February 20, 2020 and sometime later in the year for the West. Also, if you're not aware, Persona 5 Scramble has some new tunes and we can't stop listening to the \"Last Surprise\" remix for the game's battle theme.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MW68T1ImXN4", "date_published": "2020-02-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
