But the Ochoas live in Mexico City, in which there are just 45 government ambulances to support a population of around 9 million.</p><p>Mopping up the overspill is an unofficial network of private ambulances, for-profit services that ferociously compete to pick up the victims of accidents and then charge them \u2013 or at least attempt to charge them \u2013 for emergency care. The Ochoas run one such ambulance; Luke Lorentzen\u2019s remarkable film rides along inside a vehicle that supports an extended family financially and provides a lifeline for the injured and sick. It also serves as a mobile childcare unit for the younger Ochoa boy, who prefers the outlaw thrill of prowling the streets at night to the grind of the school day. And who can blame him? Captured by a camera that frequently rattles against the sides of the hurtling ambulance, the Ochoas\u2019 night-time escapades are electrifying and urgent, doused in strobing emergency lights and powered by adrenaline.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/22/midnight-family-review-documentary-mexico-city-ambulance-lorentzen\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/22/midnight-family-review-documentary-mexico-city-ambulance-lorentzen", "date_published": "2020-02-22 15:00:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "So the west is winning, is it?
