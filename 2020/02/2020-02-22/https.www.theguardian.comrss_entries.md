The debut novelist on how to write violence, taking the same advice as Irvine Welsh, and his love of Goosebumps<p>Graeme Armstrong, 28, grew up in Airdrie, east of Glasgow. He was involved with gang culture from a young age.

The book is written in a voice that recalls Irvine Welsh and Alan Warner – dialect that fizzes off the page.</p><p><strong>How much of Azzy Williams is your own experience?</strong><br />I was engaged in gangs in the local community, in North Lanarkshire. I spent many, many years living the life of Azzy Williams. His voice is a mouthpiece for my own experience. Of course he’s a fictional character in a fictional world, but his voice and my voice are akin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/22/graeme-armstrong-interview-the-young-team-airdrie-gangs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The weather did its best to spoil this game, though the two sides put on a decent show in the end.

Bournemouth players were celebrating at one end after Harry Wilson had taken Callum Wilson’s pass and slipped the ball under Nick Pope, when the game was halted because VAR was inspecting an incident a few seconds earlier, when a Dwight McNeil cross had struck Adam Smith on the shoulder in the opposite penalty area.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/burnley-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Shane Long’s early Southampton effort increases pressure on Aston Villa

<p>If Aston Villa play like this against Manchester City at Wembley next time out, an occasion to celebrate threatens to be a chastening experience. Eventually, in second-half stoppage-time, Southampton put Villa out of their misery as Stuart Armstorng swept the ball into an empty goal to build on Shane Long’s early strike. Dean Smith’s side remain embroiled in a relegation fight while Southampton can finally feel better about themselves after moving 10 points clear of the bottom three. This represented Villa’s ninth defeat in their past 12 matches and they were fortunate the scoreline was not bigger.</p><p>It took only eight minutes for Southampton to breach the worst defence in the division, with Moussa Djenepo beating Ezri Konsa to the byline before cleverly hooking a cross towards the front post with the outside of his right foot. Long was lurking and managed to steady himself to instinctively divert the ball beyond Pepe Reina with the top of his thigh. That was the start of things to come, with Southampton continuing to pepper a frail Villa defence throughout a stop-start first half, with prolonged stoppages owing to head injuries to Djenepo and Anwar El Ghazi, who was replaced by Trezeguet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/22/southampton-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Studio Formafantasma are<strong> </strong>revolutionising the use of timber in a way that will make you see this age-old material in a new light</p><p>“We want to reverse the idea that humans are the only dominant species,” says Simone Farresin, co-founder with Andrea Trimarchi of the Amsterdam-based design studio <a href="https://www.formafantasma.com/filter/home/news" title="">Formafantasma</a>. In particular, they are interested in trees. Whereas humans are “obsessed with the whole body”, trees can loses limbs and still thrive. Then there’s tree sex, which involves the intervention of insects and birds. “Within the body of a tree,” says Farresin, “there is both death and aliveness.”</p><p>Next month they open an exhibition at the Serpentine Sackler Gallery, <a href="https://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/formafantasma-cambio" title="">Cambio</a>, for which the Serpentine’s artistic director, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/05/sunday-with-hans-ulrich-obrist-i-go-to-london-zoo-mostly-for-the-architecture" title="">Hans Ulrich Obrist</a>, invited them to provide “more a way of thinking than an exhibition of products”. They have chosen to make the show about trees. It is about nothing but timber, and about everything to do with timber that you might imagine, from its molecular structure to its uses in everyday objects, to the laws and lore of forests. It takes in a genre of American portraiture that dwelt on the reflections of its sitters in their mahogany furniture, the intensity of the polish being a sign of wealth. It tells how indigenous people of the Amazonian basin use oral traditions to navigate the forest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/22/studio-formafantasma-simone-farresin-andrea-trimarchi-serpentine-gallery-cambio-wood">Continue reading...</a>

Here, on the first floor, in a two-bedroom flat with a front room, kitchen, bathroom and small balcony, Daley-Carke has created what she describes as a “natural, nourishing home” for her young family. “I never want my family to go without because we can’t afford to live in a bigger home,” she says. “But really, we don’t need any more.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/22/interiors-home-decor-how-to-redecorate-a-rental-property-on-a-budget-social-housing">Continue reading...</a>

Mark Zuckerberg and  Brussels both have ideas on AI regulation, but it’s a Cambridge statistician who has produced something intelligible<p>On Wednesday the European Commission launched a blizzard of proposals and policy papers under the general umbrella of “shaping Europe’s digital future”. The documents released included: a report on the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/commission-report-safety-and-liability-implications-ai-internet-things-and-robotics-0_en" title="">safety and liability implications of artificial intelligence, the internet of things and robotics</a>; a paper outlining the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/communication-european-strategy-data_en" title="">EU’s strategy for data</a>; and a white paper on <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/files/white-paper-artificial-intelligence-european-approach-excellence-and-trust_en" title="">“excellence and trust” in artificial intelligence</a>. In their general tenor, the documents evoke the blend of technocracy, democratic piety and ambitiousness that is the hallmark of EU communications. That said, it is also the case that in terms of doing anything to get tech companies under some kind of control, the European Commission is the only game in town.</p><p>In a nice coincidence, the policy blitz came exactly 24 hours after Mark Zuckerberg, supreme leader of Facebook, accompanied by his bag-carrier – a guy called Nicholas Clegg who looked vaguely familiar – had called on the commission graciously to explain to its officials the <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/02/big-tech-needs-more-regulation/" title="">correct way</a> to regulate tech companies.

Luke Lorentzen’s film follows an enterprising family exploiting the gap in Mexico City’s dire emergency services<p>There’s a twilight zone that the Ochoa family, the subjects of this superb observational documentary, inhabit. It’s a very dirty grey area situated somewhere between moral and amoral, occasionally dipping into outright immoral. The Ochoa men (and only once do we get a glimpse of one of the women of the family) save lives. Which, in any normal world, would make them the good guys. But the Ochoas live in Mexico City, in which there are just 45 government ambulances to support a population of around 9 million.</p><p>Mopping up the overspill is an unofficial network of private ambulances, for-profit services that ferociously compete to pick up the victims of accidents and then charge them – or at least attempt to charge them – for emergency care. The Ochoas run one such ambulance; Luke Lorentzen’s remarkable film rides along inside a vehicle that supports an extended family financially and provides a lifeline for the injured and sick. It also serves as a mobile childcare unit for the younger Ochoa boy, who prefers the outlaw thrill of prowling the streets at night to the grind of the school day. And who can blame him? Captured by a camera that frequently rattles against the sides of the hurtling ambulance, the Ochoas’ night-time escapades are electrifying and urgent, doused in strobing emergency lights and powered by adrenaline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/22/midnight-family-review-documentary-mexico-city-ambulance-lorentzen">Continue reading...</a>

How can conservationists help?</p><p>At dusk, graduate student Sara Lewis was sitting on her back porch in North Carolina with her dog. “We were supposed to be mowing our grass, but we never did, so we had long grass in our yard,” she recalls. “Suddenly this cloud of sparks rose up out of the grass and started flying around me.”</p><p>Each spark was a firefly: a beetle that glows in the dark. Hundreds of fireflies had gathered in Lewis’s back yard and were soaring around her. “It was this incredible spectacle,” says Lewis, “and I just sort of gasped.” Then she became fascinated. “I started wondering what the heck was going on here, what were these bugs doing, what were they talking about?” She has spent much of the past three decades studying fireflies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/22/why-lights-going-out-fireflies-conservation-pollution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Before writing his bestselling memoir, the potter and author had not realised that losing the thread of a family was so universal</p><p>It was difficult. I was making the most complex work of my life: an installation of 450 porcelain vessels for a red aluminium shelf 50m above the entrance to the V&amp;A. It had to be finished and installed on the scaffolding in the same month as the delivery of the final draft of <em>The Hare With Amber Eyes</em>, which follows an inherited collection of very small objects through 150 years of my Jewish family. Both projects had taken years.</p><p>My studio in Tulse Hill was tucked away behind chicken shops with a noisy garage next door. And every night I would be writing the last chapters about how close memoir feels to trespass, how to navigate what to say and what to leave unsaid, and trying to check notes on fin de siècle antisemitism or duelling codes in Paris or the weather in Odessa. We were firing the kilns every day. There were stacks of books among the glaze tests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/22/it-changed-my-life-edmund-de-waal-on-writing-the-hare-with-amber-eyes">Continue reading...</a>
