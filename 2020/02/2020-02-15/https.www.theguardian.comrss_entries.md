<p>News of Manchester City’s two-season Champions League ban hit the front pages around Spain, Italy and Germany</p><p>“Better late than never,” declared Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga. “At last Uefa is taking decisive measures. Imposing financial fair play rules and punishing financial doping is essential for the future of football.” For Tebas, this was vindication and also just the start: he has long denounced what he calls “state-clubs”, and he wants moves against PSG too. For others in Spain, the focus was turned more towards the immediate implications, although the news was equally huge: it was front page everywhere, exclamation marks underlining the shock. “City, out of Europe!” said Marca. AS went for “OUT”, in English. “Blow for City: two years without the Champions!” said Sport. “<em>Jaque al jeque</em>,” ran the cover of El Mundo Deportivo: check against the sheik.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/15/better-late-than-never-european-reaction-to-manchester-city-champions-league-ban">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One of the country’s most progressive clubs want to do far more than enjoy their day against the FA Cup holders</p><p>During the autumn, when ticket promotions for the FA Women’s Cup final were circulated, the Ipswich Town squad made each other a promise. They would not be tempted into what any set of fourth-tier players would be forgiven for doing, and buy in bulk for a day out at Wembley. The message was clear, and deadly serious: they would go hell for leather towards competing there themselves.</p><p>Given that they travel to face Manchester City on Sunday, the odds are on that ambition stalling in the last 16. Ipswich are only the second team at their level to have reached this stage and their manager, Joe Sheehan, has a point when he says a win would be “the biggest upset ever”. But this is one of the most progressive clubs in women’s football and that is why, regardless of how they fare against the holders, his players’ confidence appears bulletproof.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/15/ipswich-town-manchester-city-womens-fa-cup-biggest-upset-ever">Continue reading...</a>

You can’t go any further south without falling into the sea, which is a long way down from the top of the high cliffs near my home.

<p>A 1,000km ride on cycle trails in the Seine, Loire and Rhône valleys takes in a France inaccessible by car – and brings a rare sense of freedom</p><p>The crunch of tyres on gravel rouses me from my doze. Damn it! I knew I shouldn’t have hit “snooze”. I unzip my tent and look out on to a dewy football field. A van has pulled into the car park – it’s the groundsman arriving for morning duties. I’d intended to be out of here before anyone found me, so wiggle out of the tent and pack it as quickly and quietly as I can. “Wild” camping is n’t always an Instagrammable glade in a forest – I’ll definitely be finding a campsite tonight. I slip away undetected and ride down the narrow, slumbering streets of Chaussy, a village 70km north-west of Paris. The crisp morning air soon blows away the sleep and, as I ride past sun-painted fields with their neat rows of crops, the mist dissipates.</p><p>This is day two of an eight-day ride from Dieppe to Nice, mainly following the river valleys of the Seine, Loire and Rhône. My bike is packed with everything I’ll need: clothes, tent and flapjacks. I’ve always felt riding a bicycle is the best way of exploring the world, but most of my touring so far has been within the UK, usually ending with a dip in the North Sea. But for this summer holiday, I would swap the North Sea for the Mediterranean. At the end of this I will lie on the beach in Nice, next to people who’ve probably been lying on the beach in Nice since I started cycling. But this way, I’ll have earned it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/15/i-cycled-from-dieppe-to-nice-saw-a-different-france">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rita Ora plays the emperor in the feral singing show. Who will she give the thumbs down to in tonight’s final?<br /></p><p>Feels gladiatorial, doesn’t it – a baying and screaming crowd, chanting in violent unison, demanding Denise van Outen rip her own head off. Perhaps this is the deep truth at the heart of The Masked Singer (Saturday, 7pm, ITV): that it unmasks not its weak singers buried deep within the costume of a monster, but the crowd themselves, the raw and feral omniperson we become when we’re in them. The same crowds that called for Roman slaves to murder each other are present, here, in a pre-record studio somewhere in Hertfordshire. Rita Ora is the emperor, her thumb wavering in the air for a moment, and lo, she does point it down, and what is almost certainly Jason Manford in a hedgehog costume has to pull his own guts out with a sword, for God and for glory.</p><p>If you have not yet seen ITV’s Saturday night not-quite crown jewel, you have managed to miss absolutely nothing at all, or perhaps everything. The format is something that plunges you into a fever dream: huge unblinking creatures – a monster, a yellow bath duck, a wizened old tree – waddle on to the stage, and perform a song, and we are told a celebrity is inside there, somewhere. A panel of judges – Davina McCall, Jonathan Ross, former Community star Ken Jeong when he can be bothered, and Rita Ora – review the song and make frantic, incorrect guesses about who the celebrity inside the beast could be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/15/the-masked-singer-final-rita-ora">Continue reading...</a>

I would have to canvas for custom by leafleting homes in impoverished postcodes. When someone applied for a loan I’d go to their home bringing cash in an envelope and I’d have to knock on doors collecting the repayments. I’d earn commission which meant the more money I forced out of people the more money I would make. I saw families broken and people dying.

And the hummus? Some salad-y things. Which is your favourite out of the feta and the wedge… ? We’ll get grilled halloumi. Ooh, and cauliflower. Is this still working for you?

<p>Pop’s angry young man Archy Marshall on moving to Cheshire, singing to his daughter and writing his best ever album</p><p>Some time towards the end of 2019, Archy Marshall, AKA King Krule, found himself in Warrington standing on a wide stretch of ankle-high grass. Behind him, smoke curled into the wintry sky above Fiddlers Ferry power station. With the sun setting over its chimneys, he picked out drowsy notes on his guitar, singing deeply over the top.</p><p>What on earth was the flame-haired singer up to, miles from his south London home, his Fender Mustang hanging loosely over his shoulder? As it turns out, Marshall has a new stomping ground these days, having moved to the north-west after his partner became pregnant in 2018, to be closer to her family. “I left this city and went up there and it feels great,” he says as we settle at a table in the pub near his mum’s house back south, to the west of Peckham Rye. It is another cold evening, and he is in London rehearsing in preparation to tour Man Alive!, his third album as King Krule. The story behind the trip to the power station became clear before Christmas, when Marshall uploaded a grainy video titled Hey World! to YouTube. Along with footage of four new songs were shots of snow, the moon and copious electricity pylons (Marshall’s current fixation). His girlfriend, who was heavily pregnant during parts of the recording, was behind the camera. “I was super cold in front of that power station – I remember after five or six takes I was like: ‘Fucking hell, my fingers are falling off.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/15/i-appreciate-humanity-now-king-krule-on-punk-parenthood-and-finding-peace">Continue reading...</a>

At my kids’ birthday party in January, they received JoJo Siwa-branded diaries and accessories. In the local pharmacy, there is a whole rack of JoJo Siwa hair guff next to the milk. This week there was a book fair at their school, where you’d think you’d be safe, but no. In among the volumes of Pete the Cat and shark books, there she was – JoJo &amp; Bow Bow: The Posh Puppy Pageant, one of a series of books “written” by Siwa.</p><p>There are worse kids’ internet phenomena out there, but the breadth of the Siwa franchise, and the glittery hold she has on kindergarten-age girls, makes her one of the most annoying. Siwa, who is 16 and comes from Nebraska, sprang to fame on the back of the Lifetime TV show Dance Moms. But it was her YouTube channel, JoJo Siwa vlogs, that launched her pop career and everything that came afterwards: a 52-city US tour, endless spinoffs, and her presence in our house every day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/15/jojo-siwa-youtuber-big-bow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chucking allegations around is easy, but unsubstantiated rumours aren’t proof of anything</p><p>Just over three years ago, I walked into a house in Beverly Hills to meet a man I’d wanted to interview for more than a decade. I am the inverse of ageist when it comes to dream interviewees: the older the better, in my book, because older people have more to say, and better stories. So I was especially excited because it’s hard to find older than Kirk Douglas was then: a nice, round 100 years. We chatted for about 45 minutes, at which point he got tired and I left. Afterwards, I texted a friend to tell her about my brief brush with Hollywood’s Golden Age. She replied immediately: “Did you ask him if he raped Natalie Wood?”</p><p>I hadn’t, for reasons I’ll get to. But I was surprised that that was her first thought, because I’d assumed it was a fairly niche internet rumour.

Her roadmap to an equitable, sustainable world economy, without private land ownership, is laid out in slogans on a set of playing cards. The idea is to print a million packs to be sold as works of art, for £100 each. “You see, anybody who is prepared to pay £100 for a pack of cards is buying them because of what those cards represent. So if Greenpeace sell hundreds of sets of cards, they are in a position to say, we have hundreds of people supporting us.” She believes this will convince the world’s governments to adopt a new global economic system. “It seems I am the only person who has identified a total strategy and who also has a platform to speak,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/ng-interactive/2020/feb/15/ive-always-been-a-rebel-vivienne-westwood-and-andreas-kronthaler-on-squaring-environmental-activism-with-selling-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

## Fighting the tyranny of ‘niceness’: why we need difficult women

<p>Today’s thumbs-up, thumbs-down approach to feminism is boring and reductive. It is time to embrace complexity</p><p>Difficult. It’s a word that rests on a knife-edge: when applied to a woman, it can be admiring, fearful, insulting and dismissive, all at once. In 2016, it was used of Theresa May (she was “a bloody difficult woman,” Ken Clarke said, when she ran for Tory leader). A year later, it gave the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely" title="">US author Roxane Gay</a> the title for her short story collection. The late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/08/elizabeth-wurtzel-author-depression-prozac-nation" title="">Elizabeth Wurtzel</a> took “in praise of difficult women” as the strapline for her feminist manifesto in 1998. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/07/elizabeth-wurtzel-journalist-and-author-of-prozac-nation-dead-at-52" title="">The book’s main title was, simply, Bitch</a>.</p><p>The word is particularly pointed since it recurs so often when women talk about the consequences of challenging sexism. The TV presenter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/15/tv-presenter-helen-skelton-reveals-she-was-groped-on-air" title="">Helen Skelton</a> once described being groped on air by an interviewee while pregnant. She did not complain, she said, because “that’s just the culture that television breeds. No one wants to be difficult.” The actor <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/actress-roundtable-jennifer-lawrence-emma-stone-top-stars-harassment-hollywood-ideas-industry-change-1058091" title="">Jennifer Lawrence told the Hollywood Reporter</a> that she had once stood up to a rude director. The reaction to the incident left her worried that she would be punished by the industry. “Yeah,” chipped in fellow actor Emma Stone: “You were ‘difficult’.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/15/feminism-feminists-tyranny-niceness-complexity">Continue reading...</a>

## Rob Brydon and Steve Coogan: 'Work-wise, Steve's terrific. On a personal level, appalling'

<p>The Trip is heading to Greece for its fourth – and possibly final – leg. What has 10 years of sparring done to its stars?</p><p>It is mid-June in Epidaurus and the temperature is climbing towards 35 degrees. There is a burr of cicada and birdsong, and the mountains are a distant blue beyond a row of cypress trees. At the amphitheatre, regarded as the most <a href="http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/491" title="">acoustically and aesthetically perfect example of a Greek theatre</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/coogan">Steve Coogan</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/rob-brydon">Rob Brydon</a> stand 25 rows up, hands on hips, panamas on heads. For several minutes they bicker and berate one another; they impersonate Laurel and Hardy and Richard Burton; they discuss Pink Floyd, Ant and Dec, the nature of comedy and tragedy, until their brows dampen and their shirts stick, and they’re forced to retreat under waiting parasols. A tourist bearing the pinkened skin of the Brit abroad hovers close. “Are you Rob Brydon?” he asks brightly. “Are you doing another series of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-trip">The Trip</a>?”</p><p>They are indeed. The Trip to Greece is the fourth instalment of the series directed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-winterbottom">Michael Winterbottom</a>, a show that has proved something of an unlikely success. It began in 2010, when the concept demanded a degree of patience on behalf of the viewer: the pair playing augmented versions of their real-life selves, longstanding friends and colleagues who embark on a culinary tour of northern England together. It was slow and subtle, largely improvised, and filled with jokes about Romantic poets, sticky toffee pudding and a glut of Michael Caine impressions. Since then, they have taken trips to Italy and to Spain, with plots encompassing personal and professional disappointments, romantic entanglements, ruminations on success, celebrity, masculinity, Byron and Don Quixote, alongside deep-fried artichoke flowers, sea bass carpaccio and octopus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/15/the-trip-series-four-greece-rob-brydon-steve-coogan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Give bees and beetles a break, but still pull off the right finish<br /></p><p>According to Pinterest, “vegan lipstick” was among the most searched-for beauty terms in 2019. User searches for lip colours with no lanolin, beeswax or carmine (the crimson pigment, used in food, paint, cosmetics and more, that’s traditionally obtained by crushing minuscule insects), and that are not sold in mainland China (where animal testing is broadly mandatory), were up 150% year-on-year. It’s not a surprising figure, given the astronomical growth in vegan lifestyle. Accordingly, there are such a vast number of lipsticks for vegans that it’s no longer a question of what are they, but which are the best.</p><p>I always feel matte finishes are the truest measure of a lipstick brand, as they pose the biggest challenge – colour must be vivid and dense (any fool can make sheer tinted balm); lasting power should be long; lips should remain comfortable, not dry, rough and tight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/15/the-best-vegan-lipsticks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A pledge supported by three of the four leadership candidates has exposed a faultline running through the party</p><p>This is a story about how politics fails. It starts with a hairline crack that slowly widens, until it’s big enough for some people to slip through. Eventually, the gap becomes a chasm. And if nobody builds a bridge, eventually the other side almost disappears from sight. This week brought another small earthquake along the faultline running through the Labour party over trans rights. Three women running for the leadership – Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry – all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/labour-leadership-row-over-support-for-trans-rights-charter" title="">signed a pledge</a> drawn up by a hitherto unknown group of trans activists demanding a battle against what it calls transphobic “hate groups”. (The lone male candidate, Keir Starmer, didn’t sign; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/labour-leadership-contenders-split-over-trans-group-pledge-card" title="">Thornberry warned against using the phrase “hate group”</a>.) The pledge specifically named Woman’s Place UK (WPUK), a grouping of leftwing feminists and trade unionists who insist they don’t hate anybody but do worry about trans women accessing all-female spaces – such as domestic violence refuges, prisons, changing rooms and toilets, given proposed reforms making it easier to transition legally. The hashtag launched by defiant supporters of Woman’s Place UK – <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/expelme?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag" title="">#ExpelMe</a>, daring Labour to either kick them out or have the guts to defend them, a choice the party seems desperate to avoid – reflects long-simmering tensions.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/labour-leadership-row-over-support-for-trans-rights-charter">Labour leadership: row over support for trans rights charter</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/15/trans-rights-labour-leadership-candidates">Continue reading...</a>

Recent discoveries in space and Earth sciences have provided encouragement to searchers for distant civilisations<p>Is there anybody out there? For centuries human beings have wondered, although the ways in which we have gone about this have varied, encompassing spiritual and metaphysical questions as well as scientific ones. As we have gained greater understanding of the universe, however, our searches have taken on more concrete form. Questions about extraterrestrials have become a subject for science rather than science fiction and philosophy.</p><p>Now a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/15/astronomers-to-sweep-entire-sky-for-signs-of-extraterrestrial-life" title="">new collaboration</a> between the Very Large Array observatory in New Mexico and the privately funded Seti Institute in California, could mean that our curiosity about aliens is closer than ever before to being satisfied. Data from the VLA’s 28 giant radio telescopes, configured so as to scan a vast expanse of sky, will be fed through a special supercomputer that will search for distant signals. Scientists who work at the Seti Institute said the announcement means their research, for a long time confined to the eccentric margins of respectable science, are now “almost mainstream”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/15/the-guardian-view-on-looking-for-aliens-friends-in-the-sky">Continue reading...</a>
