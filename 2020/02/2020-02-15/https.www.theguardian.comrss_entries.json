Three women running for the leadership \u2013 Rebecca Long-Bailey, Lisa Nandy and Emily Thornberry \u2013 all <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/12/labour-leadership-row-over-support-for-trans-rights-charter\" title=\"\">signed a pledge</a> drawn up by a hitherto unknown group of trans activists demanding a battle against what it calls transphobic \u201chate groups\u201d. (The lone male candidate, Keir Starmer, didn\u2019t sign; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/13/labour-leadership-contenders-split-over-trans-group-pledge-card\" title=\"\">Thornberry warned against using the phrase \u201chate group\u201d</a>.) The pledge specifically named Woman\u2019s Place UK (WPUK), a grouping of leftwing feminists and trade unionists who insist they don\u2019t hate anybody but do worry about trans women accessing all-female spaces \u2013 such as domestic violence refuges, prisons, changing rooms and toilets, given proposed reforms making it easier to transition legally.
