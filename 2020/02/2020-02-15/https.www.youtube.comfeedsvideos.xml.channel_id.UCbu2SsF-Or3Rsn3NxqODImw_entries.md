"Oh Yeah!" Rainbow Six Siege’s Operation Void Edge adds Oryx and Iana. Oryx is a shield busting operator whose gadget, Remah Dash, allows him to run through walls, leap up to ceiling hatches, and knock over opponents like Montagne. Iana uses her Gemini Replicator to send ahead a duplicate of herself leading to important intel, follow up kills, and second chances. Operation Void Edge kicks off Year 5 Season 1 for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. Siege is out on PC, Xbox One, and PS4.
