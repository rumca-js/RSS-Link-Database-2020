## Two-goal Aubameyang clinches win for nervy Arsenal against Everton

<p>They rode their luck but, at the end of a swashbuckling encounter, Arsenal could revel in something that had eluded their season so far. This win, secured when Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang scored the last of five goals in the opening minute of the second half, was in doubt until the last second but Mikel Arteta’s side have momentum now.</p><p>It seemed some way off when Dominic Calvert-Lewin struck early on and again when, after Eddie Nketiah and Aubameyang turned the tables, Richarlison equalised. But they are now 10 games unbeaten, with three straight wins, and the head coach’s celebration at the end showed exactly what this meant: it is not improbable that they are now European contenders again. There are few certainties in football, but a nailed-on bet presented itself here: anything on offer would surely be an improvement on the dire goalless draw these sides contested four days after Christmas, both stuck in suspended animation while their newly-appointed managers watched from the Goodison Park directors’ box.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/23/arsenal-everton-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## Tories ignored expert flood advice and courted austerity. Behold the results | Simon Wren-Lewis

The Pitt review predicted the current crisis in 2008. Why did Conservative governments refuse to listen?<p>It has become an almost annual event. Heavy rain leads to widespread flooding, and people claim that we didn’t see it coming. Except we did. In 2007 the UK experienced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/gallery/2007/jul/23/flooding" title="">series of floods</a> and the government commissioned a <a href="https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100812084907/http://archive.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/pittreview/_/media/assets/www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/flooding_review/pitt_review_full%20pdf.pdf" title="">report from Michael Pitt</a>, which stated: “The scale of the problem is, as we know, likely to get worse. We are not sure whether last summer’s events were a direct result of climate change, but we do know that events of this kind are expected to become more frequent. The scientific analysis we have commissioned as part of this review (published alongside this report) shows that climate change has the potential to cause even more extreme scenarios than were previously considered possible. The country must adapt to increasing flood risk.”</p><p>The Labour government acted on the report’s recommendations. Central government spending on flood defences <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/832419/FCERM_Funding_Statistics_Publication_September_2019.pdf" title="">increased by 10%</a> in the financial year 2008-09, with an additional 10% increase in 2009-10. But then austerity happened. In 2011-12 and 2012-13, spending on flood defences was cut sharply.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/23/tories-ignored-flood-advice-austerity-pitt-review">Continue reading...</a>

While pilates and yoga concentrate on building strength and flexibility, yoga is generally regarded as having a deeper focus on increasing the range of joint motion. “Within the physical movements, there are lots of opportunities to elongate the muscles,” says Chris Magee, head of yoga at Psycle London. Tai chi loosens muscles and stretches the whole body. It is especially useful for people with limited mobility, recovering from injury or balance problems as it can be adapted to suit a range of abilities.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/23/five-ways-improve-flexibility">Continue reading...</a>

## The Father review - Alfred Molina is tremendous in Florian Zeller’s tragic farce

<p><strong>Pasadena Playhouse, Los Angeles</strong><br />The actor brings out the dark humour in Zeller’s modern classic about a man with dementia, fluctuating from absurdity to despair in a heartbeat</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p>It is more than five years since Florian Zeller’s refracted drama about dementia had its English-language <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/23/the-father-review-ustinov-theatre-royal-bath-florian-zeller">premiere at the Ustinov in Bath</a>. That production, with Kenneth Cranham as the disorientated André, had three runs in London; Frank Langella took the part on Broadway, and Anthony Hopkins plays André in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/the-father-review-anthony-hopkins-olivia-colman">a </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/the-father-review-anthony-hopkins-olivia-colman">forthcoming film version</a>, directed by Zeller. The French playwright has since rounded off a family trilogy with The Mother and The Son, also translated by Christopher Hampton, along with several other meditations on marriage. But it is The Father, with its shades of King Lear, that has become Zeller’s signature piece, and it boasts a formidably challenging lead role, fluctuating between fury and fragility in a heartbeat.</p><p>In this Los Angeles production directed by Jessica Kubzansky, Alfred Molina – who is younger than his predecessors in the part by some years – seizes upon Zeller’s subtitle for the play: “a tragic farce”. Such was the overwhelming climactic pathos of Cranham’s performance in the original production, it is easy to forget the bustling humour of the play’s opening minutes, which give a double sense to André’s bewildered cry that “there’s something funny going on”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/23/the-father-review-alfred-molina-florian-zeller-pasadena-playhouse-los-angeles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Until her death in a freak accident, the ‘radical and shocking’ Isadora Duncan transformed dance. Now her feminist free spirit struts the stage again</p><p>‘You’ll have to excuse me, I’m just trying to fight with this veil,” says Viviana Durante, wrestling with an unwieldy sheet of coral silk as I walk into her studio. Voluminous wafting scarves are a key prop in the image and mythology of Isadora Duncan, the American pioneer of modern dance whose life was as free-spirited as her art. Durante is hoping to tap into some of that spirit in her latest production, honouring the unconventional dance icon.</p><p>A leading ballerina with the Royal Ballet in the 1990s, 52-year-old Durante is returning to the stage in Isadora Now, the third outing for her own company. As well as Durante performing Frederick Ashton’s Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, there will be the rare sight of a 1911 Duncan work, Dance of the Furies, and a new piece by <a href="https://www.joyalpuertoritter.com/">Joy Alpuerto Ritter</a>, recasting Duncan’s freedom of expression and feminist power for current times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/23/viviana-durante-interview-isadora-duncan-dance">Continue reading...</a>

## King Krule: Man Alive! review – stirring, dreamy optimism

<p>(XL)</p><p>Archy Marshall has been refining his woozy, washed-out sounds since he emerged back in 2010. With each release under his King Krule moniker, he has shown a proclivity for deeply emotive, expansive musicality steeped in urban loneliness. Since his last album as King Krule, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/12/king-krule-the-ooz-review-archy-marshall" title="">2017’s Mercury-nominated </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/12/king-krule-the-ooz-review-archy-marshall" title="">The Ooz</a></em>, Marshall and his partner have had a child and moved out of London – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/15/i-appreciate-humanity-now-king-krule-on-punk-parenthood-and-finding-peace" title="">he seems happier, lighter for it</a>.</p><p>Like its predecessors, <em>Man Alive!</em> was recorded at night, and it swims languorously with romance and tenderness, deftly pulling sonics from jazz, post-punk, soul and dubstep. Through the dreamlike wails of sax and scuzz, optimism seeps through. “The rain will pass in time,” he advises on Alone, Omen 3. Marshall’s grizzled vocals ebb and flow, from lamenting “another lonely night” to declaring “you’re my everything” on Perfecto Miserable. On closing track Please Complete Thee, he despairs about “everything just constantly letting me down” over charged synths and pining guitar reverb, before the tone shifts to something more uplifting and twinkling. The final refrain of “please complete me” carries a powerful sense of hope – an end befitting an album that finds King Krule hitting a new stride. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/23/king-krule-man-alive-review-archy-marshall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Synthetic or natural, they will last longer if you wash and dry them carefully once a week – without using hot water</p><p>As a professional, I clean my brushes after every use, but if you are using your own brushes for your own makeup, once a week would be good. When I’m on a shoot, or out and about, I use a professional brush cleaner such as Parian Spirit, which is made from citrus and is environmentally friendly. It is also good if you are a bit lazy and don’t want to shampoo your brushes. Spray some on to a tissue, and wipe the brush until there is no product coming out of it.</p><p>To wash, use lukewarm water – if the water is too hot, it will destroy the glue and loosen the hairs – and shampoo or a good washing-up liquid. Point the brush with the hairs facing downwards, so the water doesn’t run up into the brush. Lather up some shampoo and wash the bristles. When you rinse, squeeze until the water stops bubbling. Dry gently with a towel and dry them flat overnight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/23/how-to-clean-your-makeup-brushes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Seeing the hidden world of care, after my beloved brother’s devastating accident, taught me about people’s remarkable strength and grace</p><p>I often find myself thinking back to a fairly unremarkable afternoon in 2010. I was sitting in the day room of a care home while my older brother Miles slept beside me, in his wheelchair. Steve, one of the other severely brain-injured residents dotted around the room in wheelchairs, was in distress. His hands were up by his face in tight fists and he was weeping. Nothing anyone did to comfort or soothe him worked; the look on his contorted face was one of pure anguish.</p><p>And then, just as Miles was waking up, Steve’s wife Natalia entered the room. Seeing her husband, she dropped her bags and ran to him, holding his face in her hands and covering it in kisses. Normally an outspoken and wonderfully foul-mouthed woman, she spoke now in gentle, incantatory whispers. I’ve never seen relief like the relief that flooded Steve’s face; it spread over his face and even his limbs, his neck softening back into the headrest, hands uncurling. It was a moment of tenderness and care, but also such profound intimacy that I found myself turning away, as if I were intruding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/23/caring-for-my-brother-after-his-brain-injury-showed-me-a-world-of-compassion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After battling to stop a no-deal Brexit, the ex-MP has written a modern fable, Apocalypse How?, warning of the catastrophe our tech dependence could cause</p><p>Oliver Letwin’s strange and somewhat alarming new book begins at midnight on Thursday 31 December 2037. In Swindon – stay with me! – a man called Aameen Patel is working the graveyard shift at Highways England’s traffic HQ when his computer screen goes blank, and the room is plunged into darkness. He tries to report these things to his superiors, but can get no signal on his mobile. What’s going on? Looking at the motorway from the viewing window by his desk, he observes, not an orderly stream of traffic, but a dramatic pile-up of crashed cars and lorries – at which point he realises something is seriously amiss. In the Britain of 2037, everything, or almost everything, is controlled by 7G wireless technology, from the national grid to the traffic (not only are cars driverless; a vehicle cannot even join a motorway without logging into an “on-route guidance system”). There is, then, only one possible explanation: the entire 7G network must have gone down.</p><p>It sounds like I’m describing a novel – and it’s true that Aameen Patel will soon be joined by another fictional creation in the form of Bill Donoghue, who works at the Bank of England, and whose job it will be to tell the prime minister that the country is about to pay a heavy price for its cashless economy, given that even essential purchases will not be possible until the network is back up (Bill’s mother-in-law is also one of thousands of vulnerable people whose carers will soon be unable to get to them, the batteries in their electric cars having gone flat). But <em>Apocalypse How?</em> is not a novel. It’s a peculiar hybrid: part fable, part fact. Aameen, Bill and all Letwin’s other characters exist only to illustrate aspects of his wider thesis, which is that our increasing reliance on integrated digital technology may be leading us, and ultimately every country in the world, in the direction of a catastrophe. I exaggerate a little, but think TV’s <em>Survivors</em> minus the mystery virus (though at the moment, we handily have one of those on our hands, too).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/23/oliver-letwin-internet-of-things-tipping-point-apocalypse-how-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Teen magazines may be extinct, but their pernicious advice still lives online | Rachael Krishna

Social media is giving bad guidance to girls – and there’s still a reluctance to talk about women’s bodies or their pain<p>If there was anyone in need of clear information about the process of developing into a woman, it was my teenage self – raised by brothers and attending a faith-based school where discussions of sexual health were severely limited. Before social media the places where young people curious about their bodies and puberty could find information were few and far between. For peoPle like me, teen magazines were the logical place to look for answers.</p><p>Magazines for teenagers existed long before the 1990s and 2000s, but there was a boom in titles during those two decades. Mizz was first published in 1985; Bliss followed 10 years later, and CosmoGirl arrived in 1999. Young people had more expendable income, and groups like the Spice Girls rose to prominence in an era that prized the idea of female empowerment. Young women had a plethora of titles we could purchase ourselves. Hidden behind covers displaying members of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_(English_group)" title="">Blue</a> and free samples of Impulse were headlines about periods, body hair and relationships, all promising honest information derived from real-life experience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/23/teen-magazines-social-media">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Foundation, concealer, a little eyeliner… More and more men now put on makeup on a daily basis. Priya Elan meets the influencers behind the trend – and has a makeover himself</p><p>The first time I tried on makeup I was six years old and my older sister decided to cover me in sickly raspberry-coloured glittery lipstick following the “more is better” mantra and the ethos, “it’s not on the lips, it’s around the lips.”</p><p>As I was presented to my parents, like a trussed up lamb to the slaughter beamed in from Laboratoire Garnier, Paris, the reaction was resoundingly reticent. Things turned into a Pinter play. My father was quietly horrified, refusing to talk for about six hours, and the incident was largely ignored by my mother who retired to the kitchen to gently throttle a metre of pastry. In the silent judgment that followed, I picked up on the vibe: boys don’t wear makeup. Clearly, I <em>wasn’t</em> born with it, whatever the Maybelline advert may say.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/23/beauty-and-the-bloke-why-more-men-are-chooisng-to-wear-makeup-warpaint">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since #MeToo, France’s notoriously liberal attitudes to sex and sexual power are under the microscope as never before</p><p>A few years ago I spent the weekend in a château deep in the rural Auvergne region of central France. Even more memorable than the crumbling property with its hectares of forest and decaying outbuildings, were the two elderly men to whom we were introduced when we arrived, who were enjoying an afternoon gin and tonic in the library. One – the father of my friend Guillaume – was Guillaume’s mother’s longtime lover until her recent death. The other was his mother’s husband and the owner of the château where Guillaume grew up. The two men had remained on excellent terms for 40 years.</p><p>The setup had all the ingredients of one of those lyrical French films starring Gérard Depardieu, replete with lavish interiors and rhapsodic landscapes looping through the changing seasons. It also ticked every box for lascivious British assumptions about the French, among whom infidelity, at least among the rich, powerful and famous, has long been something of a hallmark of a specifically French insouciance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/23/ne-me-touche-pas-the-shift-in-sex-and-power-sweeping-france">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A niche Marvel bad guy would fit right in with Dominic Cumming’s team of free-thinkers, mavericks and eugenicists</p><p>The <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Hate-Monger_(Earth-616)" title="">Hate-Monger</a> is a minor Marvel comics villain, first documented by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee in December 1963, who is a clone of Hitler and wears a purple Ku Klux Klan robe. In <em>Fantastic Four</em> issue 21, The Hate-Monger bounces his Hate-Ray off the moon, amplifying people’s feelings of dread, fear and anxiety, inflaming their prejudices and turning humanity against itself. And yet somehow, last week, The Hate-Monger himself was given a job at the very heart of Dominic Cumming’s government. And this despite his saying the “underclass” should undergo enforced contraception, women’s sport is like the paralympics, wives should provide sex on demand and black people were more stupid than white people. And all while bouncing a Hate-Ray off the moon and wearing a purple Ku Klux Klan robe. And being a clone of Hitler.</p><p>“We should prevent racists coming into No 10 or wherever The Hate-Monger was working,” said Kwasi Alfred Addo Kwarteng, MP for Spelthorne, former undersecretary of state for the Department for Exiting the European Union and current minister of state for business, energy and clean growth, “and I think that we do need to look at these processes.” What will it take for black Conservatives to disavow the Cumming government they facilitate? Didn’t the fact that The Hate-Monger was wearing a purple Ku Klux Klan robe while bouncing a Hate-Ray off the moon and being a clone of Hitler set off some alarm bells? Views such as The Hate-Monger’s define Cumming’s government. The assertion last November, by the resentful foundling and reformed coke-face Michael Gove, that Stormzy should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/nov/26/i-set-trends-dem-man-copy-michael-gove-mocks-stormzy-labour-support" title="">stick to rapping and stay out of politics</a>, assumes black folk are made for singing, dancing and running, while white people are better suited to white people’s activities – such as Latin, crown green bowls and the clarinet. And the now muzzled Jacob Rees-Mogg blamed the Grenfell victims’ stupidity <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/jacob-rees-mogg-claims-grenfell-victims-lacked-common-sense" title="">for their misfortune</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/23/downing-street-haven-for-weirdos-misfits-and-actual-comic-book-villains">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sharon Horgan’s eviscerating self-awareness underlies some of the biggest cult comedy hits of recent years. But now she’s going after mainstream movies and a directorial debut</p><p>Sharon Horgan doesn’t especially enjoy watching herself on screen any more. She feels an awkwardness that, she thinks, comes from years of sitting in edit suites scrutinising take after take of television programmes she has created, co-written and starred in. Shows such as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/garethmcleanblog/2009/may/15/television" title="">Pulling</a></em>, a black comedy about three female flatmates that first aired in 2006 and was her breakthrough. And <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/feb/12/catastrophe-finale-review-the-end-of-a-gloriously-monstrous-era" title="">Catastrophe</a></em>, the Channel 4 series (rejected by the BBC) that she made with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rob-delaney" title="">Rob Delaney </a>about a one-night stand with long-term effects that ran for four seasons and has been broadcast in 133 countries and now means she has to have clocks in her London offices showing the time in New York and Los Angeles. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sharon-horgan" title="">Horgan</a>, who is 49 and has eviscerating self-awareness, also accepts that “vanity” might be a factor.</p><p>“I just don’t <em>love</em> seeing myself as an older person on screen,” she says, with a snorty half-laugh that seems to punctuate her most radically honest statements. “There’s always a weird transitional period where you go from being able to play a girl who doesn’t know where her life is going to playing the mother of an 18-year-old. The adjustment for that just takes a little bit of time.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/23/sharon-horgan-i-want-adventures-to-do-stuff-that-is-challenging">Continue reading...</a>

The vile ideas behind the Hanau attack have moved from the fringe to the mainstream<p>“Hate is a poison that… is responsible for far too many crimes,” <a href="https://www.tagesschau.de/multimedia/video/video-663707.html" title="">said the German chancellor</a>, Angela Merkel, after the killing of nine people in a far-right terror attack on two shisha bars in the German town of Hanau last week. “This is neither rightwing nor leftwing terror, it’s the crazy act of a deranged man,” <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/extreme-right-killings-leave-merkel-coalition-searching-for-answers/" title="">responded </a>Jörg Meuthen, a spokesman for the virulently anti-immigrant Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).</p><p>It’s an argument that’s becoming as depressingly familiar as the attacks themselves.

<p>Experts say funding cuts led to care homes closures which only the rich can escape</p><p>The growing crisis in adult social care risks creating a “system for the rich” that leaves poor communities unable to access the essential help they need, ministers are being warned.</p><p>Two care homes are closing for every new facility that opens as providers attempt to stay afloat amid a multibillion-pound shortfall in funding. However, evidence seen by the <em>Observer</em> suggests places are disappearing from care homes that already have a shortfall of beds, while new facilities are opening for those who can pay their own way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/23/social-care-crisis-blow-to-poor">Continue reading...</a>

Given near-unlimited access, David Douglas Duncan captures Pablo and Jacqueline Picasso relaxing at their house in Cannes in 1957<p>David Douglas Duncan, who died in 2018 aged 102, came to think of himself as the luckiest photographer alive. In February 1956 he travelled from his home in the United States to Cannes in the hope of photographing the world’s most famous artist, Pablo Picasso.</p><p>Duncan had been a distinguished photojournalist with the US marines in the Korean war; his fellow photographer, Robert Capa, had suggested to him during that conflict that somebody should knock on Picasso’s door and persuade him to let them take pictures of him as he worked.

<p>Fishing was a powerful factor in the case for leaving the EU. On the eve of crucial trade talks, the Observer finds optimism tempered by caution on the quays of Devon and Cornwall</p><p>Neil Watson was eight or nine when his dad took him out to sea for the first time. Soon he was earning his first pocket money by washing fish boxes on the quay at Brixham in south Devon. Three years after he started crewing, he got his skipper’s ticket and eventually he bought his own boat. For 30 years, he regularly spent seven days at sea followed by one night off, only stopping when his boat sank two years ago.</p><p>“I fished through good times and bad times. Fishing’s like riding a wave – one minute you’re up the top, and the next you’re down in the trough,” he said. Now Watson works at Brixham’s fish market, one of the largest in England, where £40m of fish was sold last year across the UK and Europe. A fisherman’s life is brutal, he said, but he badly misses the camaraderie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/23/brexit-deal-fishing-cornwall-devon-trade-talks-europe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chinese restaurants need your custom – no hard thing to give when the food is this good</p><p><strong>Four Seasons, 12 Gerrard Street, London W1D 5PR (020 7494 0870). Starters £3.20-£12.80, roast duck portion £11.40, half £14.40, mains £9.30-£20.50, wines from £17.80, beers £4.50</strong></p><p>It’s after dinner that we really notice it. London’s Gerrard Street on a Saturday night is usually the restaurant equivalent of a mosh pit: a heaving crowd of hungry people, the scent of scorched wok in their nostrils, and the reflection of the bronzed and shiny roast ducks that crowd the windows of Chinatown’s main drag in their eyeballs. Tonight, there was a pre-cinema rush, which we got caught up in. But now it’s gone 9pm. The pedestrianised street is sparsely populated and through the picture windows, chairs and tables sit forlorn and empty. I’ve never seen it like this before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/23/four-seasons-london-an-act-of-solidarity-that-also-gets-me-roast-duck">Continue reading...</a>
