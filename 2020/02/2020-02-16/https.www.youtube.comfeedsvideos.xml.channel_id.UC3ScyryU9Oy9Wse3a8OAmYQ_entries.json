Now Institute at NYU, tells FRONTLINE in this excerpt from the documentary \"Amazon Empire.\" \n\n\u201cAnd this data collection is extremely important to this business model. It\u2019s extremely hard to do \u2026 convincing people to just deploy something like this in their home is\u2014 it\u2019s a brilliant trick,\u201d she says.\n\nIt\u2019s one that\u2019s helping Amazon in a quest to dominate the future \u2014 not just of commerce, but also artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to move as intimately as possible and as quietly as possible into everyday life,\u201d Shoshana Zuboff, author of The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, says in the film. \u201cAmazon wants to have the entire environment, essentially miked\u2026 All these intimacies, all this insight is being integrated, analyzed and integrated. That is an extraordinary kind of power that has never before existed.\u201d \n\nOn its website, Amazon says that its Alexa and Echo devices are designed to protect users\u2019 privacy. Amazon's head of devices, Dave Limp, disputes FRONTLINE producer James Jacoby\u2019s characterization of them as \u201clistening devices,\u201d telling him the \u201cwake-word\u201d engine responsible for turning on an Echo via voice command is \u201cnot really listening; it\u2019s detecting one thing and one thing only, which is the word you've said that you want to get the attention of that Echo.\u201d  \u00a0\n\nBut once the device is awake and the blue light is on, it\u2019s recording. \u201cThe problem,\u201d says futurist Amy Webb, \u201cis that we forget that it\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nFor the full story, watch \"Amazon Empire: The Rise and Reign of Jeff Bezos\" in full starting Tuesday, Feb. 18 at 9/8c on PBS and online: https://to.pbs.org/2SH9uSj\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
