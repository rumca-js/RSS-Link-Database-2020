We build a very stealthy gaming PC for your living space that fits under the Dyson Pure Hot + Cool. Thankfully with Dyson's awesome design and our ingenuity, we can keep the computer hidden easily! We show you the process, the mishaps, and the triumphs of this build. Not only is this a gaming computer, which can cool you at the same time, but it is our first 3D printed computer case!!
