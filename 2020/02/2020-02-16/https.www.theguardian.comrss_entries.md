## Justin Bieber: Changes review – mid-tempo wedded bliss

<p>(Def Jam)</p><p>Nothing frames a pop album quite like a redemption narrative, and for <a href="https://www.justinbiebermusic.com/" title="">Justin Bieber</a> this is his second in a row. While 2015’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/justin-bieber-purpose-review-a-grown-up-sorry-sort-of" title="">Purpose</a></em>, preceded by problems with the police and a much publicised breakup, was full of culture-shifting hits, from the pleading Sorry to the bitter Love Yourself, <em>Changes</em> – created in the midst of health issues and a hasty marriage <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/09/justin-bieber-reportedly-engaged-to-model-hailey-baldwin" title="">to model Hailey Baldwin</a> – finds Bieber swapping instant anthems for mid-tempo, trap-adjacent R&amp;B often rendered frictionless by bedroom-centred wedded bliss. So on the tactile Available he coos: “Say I’m number one on your to-do list,” while Come Around Me’s “Do me like you miss me” hook swims around a modern approximation of 90s new jack swing.</p><p>There are welcome changes of pace – the rib-rattling Forever featuring Post Malone a highlight – but the tempo drops again for a suite of acoustic sketches that touch on God (the title track), patience (Confirmation) and, on ETA, the joys of online surveillance (“Drop me a pin so I can know your location”). It’s a subdued end to an album that feels like a purely selfish endeavour on Bieber’s part. After years of people-pleasing, perhaps that’s its biggest success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/16/justin-bieber-changes-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Every woman is different and it’s best to get into the habit of examining yourself regularly so you can spot any changes</p><p>There is no evidence to suggest that a particular technique works best, but checking your breasts regularly is vital; the sooner breast cancer is diagnosed, the more effective treatment may be.</p><p>All breasts are different, so women are encouraged to get to know their own breasts over time. Follow this simple advice: touch, look and check (TLC). Some breasts have natural bumps or nodular breast tissue, and women often have one breast larger than the other. Changes can also occur to the breasts during women’s cycles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/16/doing-it-right-check-yourself-for-breast-cancer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Levels of food insecurity in Britain are among the highest in Europe. Here, campaigners and struggling families explain why food banks alone won’t solve the problem</p><p>Sarah Batts shows me up a narrow staircase and into her one-bedroom flat. It’s in the converted roof space in a not-great area of Eastbourne. The flat is crammed full of baby equipment for her 15-month-old daughter, Scarlette. Stiflingly hot in late summer, there’s nowhere to sit and eat a meal, partly because the place is tiny and partly because, in common with households with small children across the land, every flat surface including the dining table is covered with stuff.</p><p>After working in a pet shop for 14 years, Batts, 38, now can’t hold down a job due to poor health. In any case, since her daughter’s birth she has looked after Scarlette on her own. She is dependent on benefits and gets around £250 per week. Her monthly rent is £580, then there’s bills, and she usually allows £25 for her weekly food shop. Budgeting, she says, “is pretty hard, because you don’t get that much. I probably do spend way too much on food.” She orders groceries online because she can’t drive and her illness means she struggles to leave her flat. “I worry about money pretty much all the time,” she says. “I always end up with nothing at the end of the month.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/16/food-poverty-millions-children-uk-not-enough-to-eat">Continue reading...</a>

Two months later, when the first video (of Karim briefly describing the elephant enclosure at the San Diego Zoo) was uploaded, a platform was launched that has gone on to change the world.</p><p>Today, more than 2bn of us visit YouTube monthly, and 500 hours of footage is uploaded every minute. That’s a far cry from the 18-second video that started it all. Its stars are multi-millionaires: YouTube’s highest earner in 2019 was an eight-year-old called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/dec/20/youtube-highest-earner-eight-year-old-guan-ryans-world" title="">Ryan</a>, who netted $26m. The number of creators earning five or six figures has increased by more than 40% year on year. At first, users earned a few hundred pounds for mentioning products in their videos; now they can make hundreds of thousands, and much more through exclusive brand deals. Not many like talking about their income: it makes them less relatable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/16/youtube-turns-15-what-happened-to-some-of-the-platfoms-biggest-early-stars">Continue reading...</a>

## James Blunt review – beige balladeer turns up the self-deprecating charm

<p><strong>Birmingham Arena<br /></strong>Blunt brings his social media wit to a Valentine’s day show in which the best moments are the most personal</p><p>Having a global smash as couple-friendly as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/14/james-blunt-how-we-made-youre-beautiful">You’re Beautiful</a> would often cast a singer-songwriter as gooey but wearily earnest “serious artist”. But James Blunt tore up the script, using social media to reinvent himself as a troll-obliterating, self-deprecating wit. When a chap tweeted him fretting that he was “really enjoying James Blunt’s new album” (Once Upon a Mind), the 45-year-old former army captain shot back: “It’s the menopause.”</p><p>This is the persona Blunt brings to concerts, which may have been a fiendish career move but seems to come naturally. He jokes that people are “weird, but lovely” to attend his gig on Valentine’s night and reveals that Elton John advised him to always play the hits. “That’s me fucked. I’d have to play You’re Beautiful 22 times.” He dedicates a song to “couples” and with comic timing introduces Goodbye My Lover, a song about a crushing breakup, performed with the intensity he wrote it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/16/james-blunt-review-beige-balladeer-turns-up-the-self-deprecating-charm">Continue reading...</a>

Once Corona was a beloved brand of fizzy pop – now it’s three syllables to strike fear in the heart<p>Why must things change, I wonder? Why can’t they just be the same for ever? It is a common grievance, and one of the main factors that drove the pro-Brexit vote. Thankfully, soon “things” will be able to go back to being “like they were”. A Clarks Commando shoe, with white dog muck in the treads, will moon-stomp on a Remoaner’s face – for ever.</p><p>Words, however, have a habit of changing their meanings, and the fact that I am submitting this week’s column from a medical isolation tent at an undisclosed emergency location proves their fluid nature. Bear with me. Imagine, for example, that I were to come into work and say: “Hello. I am gay today!” Once, not long ago, everyone would have assumed I meant I was happy. But the word “gay” officially transitioned to meaning “homosexual” on 5 July 1960, its new coinage minted by Benny Hill in the Tommy Steele vehicle <em>Light Up </em><em>the Sky!</em>, a Brechtian comedy about a man trying to get his wedding cake iced by a recidivist Northern Irish baker.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/stewart-lee-coronavirus-is-ruining-my-happy-memories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Women have spent centuries under the male gaze. Men, less so. As a new exhibition opens at the Barbican in London, Luke Turner ponders what today’s increasingly fluid notions of masculinity mean for us all</p><p>The male gaze can be harshest when directed at the self. Until puberty, I was blissfully unaware of my own body, aside from the odd graze or bee sting. But then, at the age of 11 or 12, my body became a contested space. In the steaming showers after PE, I compared myself unfavourably to others, both my classmates and what I saw in the wider culture. I’m sure I wasn’t alone in finding that infamous Coca-Cola window-cleaner advert (in which a shirtless man tantalises an office full of women) to be 30 seconds of highly triggering humiliation – and a (low-calorie) modicum of sweet revenge for all the years of men doing the same to women.</p><p>Yet watching the video again as I write this essay on how to explore the buffeted nature of modern masculinity against the physicality of the male body itself, I can easily recall that awkward, resentful twinge. For the past quarter-century or so, my life staring at men has been a complicated experience – a signal to arousal, yes, but also to fright and flight; to self-loathing at my own physical inadequacy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/16/putting-men-in-the-frame-photography-exhibition-masculinities-liberation-barbican">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In his new biography, the former chief art critic of the Washington Post sheds new light on the late 20th century’s defining artist</p><p>“Andy Warhol, prince of pop art” – that’s still how we pigeonhole the man often described as the greatest of the west’s postwar artists, even though pop only occupied the first three years of his fine-art career. In the quarter-century that followed, Warhol produced a vast range of work that has gone on to matter at least as much, if not more, to our culture. For better or worse, we’d not be quite where we are without his radical films, his society portraits – cool-eyed or caustic, depending on who you ask – or <em>Interview</em> magazine. The 1,000 pages of <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/warhol-9780241003381.html" title="">Warhol: A Life As Art</a></em>, my new biography, offers the first definitive account of all that and more.</p><p>In the two excerpts that follow, we catch Warhol just as he has left pop art behind and is fishing for new ways to make his mark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/16/andy-warhol-life-as-art-blake-gopnik-biography-extract">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Previous experiments with control-freak premierships have not turned out well</p><p>Boris Johnson has spent his career disguising cunning plans as unintended blunders and dressing up stupid errors as machiavellian strokes. So there has been much understandable confusion about whether the defenestration of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/14/bloodbath-how-the-papers-covered-sajid-javid-quitting-the-cabinet" title="">Sajid Javid</a> was by accident or by design. In the immediate aftermath of his resignation, Number 10 didn’t much object to suggestions that the prime minister engineered the chancellor’s removal by ambushing him with a demand to sack all his special advisers, a demand that the prime minister knew the other man could never accept. This version of events appalled a lot of Tory MPs and generated much finger-pointing at Dominic Cummings, who I won’t call the prime minister’s Rasputin because he likes the label too much.</p><p>It then suited some of Mr Johnson’s friends to spin that it was not a cunning plan at all, but an innocent cockup. Not: ha, we screwed Javid. But: oops, we lost Saj. On this account, the chancellor reacted with more hostility than anticipated when, towards the end of their conversation on the morning of reshuffle day, Mr Johnson asked him to dispense with his closest aides. The prime minister, so this story goes, was genuinely surprised and sad to lose his services.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/boris-johnson-will-find-there-is-price-to-pay-for-no10-power-grab">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For a decade Whitehall has been left in little doubt of the special adviser’s power</p><p>As Tory MPs gathered in parliament on Wednesday evening, just hours before a reshuffle that most believed would be intriguing rather than explosive, they gave a warm welcome to the opening speaker. A grinning Sajid Javid, whose position as chancellor had previously been publicly guaranteed by the prime minister, said a few warm words before introducing Andy Street, the West Midlands mayor who talked them through his plans. For those in the room with doubts about Javid’s future, his cameo reassured them that he would survive the imminent ministerial cull.</p><p>Despite the smile, however, Javid himself had become less confident in his position in the days leading up to Thursday’s reshuffle. He confided in friends that he feared his special advisers were being targeted by Downing St. A week of damaging media briefings about the forthcoming budget and relations between the Treasury and No 10 had raised fresh doubts. Those doubts were well founded: by late morning, he had gone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/16/powerplay-how-chancellor-lost-control-of-no-11">Continue reading...</a>

Parliament agreed and rejected the proposal. Now, 150 years later, Houghton is a forgotten figure. That proposal, however, has been entrenched in British law. The government enjoys far greater “transcendental power” to deprive Britons of citizenship than even Gladstone could have imagined.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/16/citizenship-precious-right-not-to-be-arbitrarily-revoked-by-the-state">Continue reading...</a>

Occasionally, I get a laugh out of what I dream up as a priority worry; more often I’m shocked by the banality. A thank you note I failed to send a year ago; the small part for a kitchen appliance I keep forgetting to order; whether I booked Ocado for Friday; whether Stormzy will agree to talk to me about his favourite books; the shirt my son needs; guilt because I didn’t call my friend with breast cancer; where to go on summer holidays; how to get the car to its service in Yeovil; why the person I discussed documentary ideas with hasn’t replied; did I book a blowdry on Tuesday? And where has that blue dress gone?</p><p>I look at the clock again, it’s 3.15am and I’m getting closer to the moment when I’m going to have to medicate or resign myself to staying awake. Now adding to my copious preoccupations: what do I have to do in the morning? Can I afford to be exhausted or should I resort to the cornucopia of drugs and sleep aids crammed into my bedside drawer?

## Difficult Women by Helen Lewis review – clever and generous

<p>An inspiring hymn to the feminists who fought for change illustrates why it pays to be demanding</p><p>Helen Lewis begins her book, subtitled “a history of feminism in 11 fights”, with a question. What, she asks, does it mean to be a “difficult woman”? You may not be entirely surprised to hear that I didn’t really need to read on to know the answer to this. Like many, if not most, of my closest friends, I’ve been a difficult woman for more than three decades now. Naturally, then, I find it strange and slightly alarming for a writer to feel she has to plead, as Lewis goes on to do, for understanding in the matter of the “complicated” woman. Surely this should go unsaid. If it’s entirely human to be multifaceted – for some aspects of your personality to be trickier and darker than others – isn’t it also beholden upon you to be sympathetic to such quirks and flaws in other people?</p><p>But this is where we are. Twenty-first-century culture has, as Lewis notes, a tendency – you might call it a mania – for disapproving of both contemporary and historical figures on the grounds that aspects of their lives or work are distasteful. Those considered to be too unpalatable are quickly written out of the story (AKA cancelled); others are carefully repackaged, their sharper corners having been, as she puts it, carefully sandblasted. More insidious still is the question of likability. Why do women have to be nice? When I was publicising <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/her-brilliant-career-9781844087419.html" title="">my book</a> about some female pioneers of the 1950s, I grew used to the moment at literary festivals when someone in a nubbly sweater and unlikely earrings would announce to me in a tight, little voice that, for all their achievements, she simply didn’t <em>like</em> any of the women whose lives I’d spent so long researching. I grew to despise this. I don’t even like the people I <em>love</em> all the time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/16/difficult-women-history-of-feminism-11-fights-helen-lewis-review">Continue reading...</a>
