What, she asks, does it mean to be a \u201cdifficult woman\u201d? You may not be entirely surprised to hear that I didn\u2019t really need to read on to know the answer to this. Like many, if not most, of my closest friends, I\u2019ve been a difficult woman for more than three decades now. Naturally, then, I find it strange and slightly alarming for a writer to feel she has to plead, as Lewis goes on to do, for understanding in the matter of the \u201ccomplicated\u201d woman. Surely this should go unsaid. If it\u2019s entirely human to be multifaceted \u2013 for some aspects of your personality to be trickier and darker than others \u2013 isn\u2019t it also beholden upon you to be sympathetic to such quirks and flaws in other people?</p><p>But this is where we are.
