ðŸ‘‰ Thank you to everyone who has contributed, even a cent, to helping me in my journalistic efforts to travel around the country, record hearings, and lobby at them. I DID NOT RECORD THIS, I RIPPED IT FROM HAWAII'S WEBSITE! I hired someone to record it and they didn't plug into the XLR patch panel so the audio was garbage. Hopefully Hawaii doesn't copyright claim me.
