Monday\u2019s Iowa caucuses had ended with the two candidates effectively tied after disastrous and seemingly systemic incompetence drew out the reporting process for days. The debate in New Hampshire was pitched as a contest between them, a bid to see which would prevail \u2013 the moderate, big money-backed Buttigieg, or the grassroots financing juggernaught of the progressive Sanders.

Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, attacked Buttigieg fiercely and repeatedly.

But there was also what seemed like a degree of sincere personal contempt in Klobuchar\u2019s remarks toward Buttigieg.
