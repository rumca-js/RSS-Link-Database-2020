Or The Onion Router? Both of these tools are marketed to people looking for better privacy and anonymity on the Internet.\n\nMany regular people that choose VPNs do so to prevent their ISPs from spying on their browsing history and selling it to advertisers. What they don\u2019t realize is that they are not enhancing their privacy \u2013 they are just delegating the trust to a different company.\n\nYour VPN provider acts as your entry and exit node. They know your true IP address and they know what websites you visit. If they want to, they can log this activity at any time. If they are required by law enforcement, they can hand over all of your browsing data to them. \n\n\n\nCredits: \n\nFirst track by Chuki Beats https://www.youtube.com/user/CHUKImusic\nMusic by CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ohvf03NiIA", "date_published": "2020-02-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
