## Banned, snubbed, and saved by Colin Firth – my life in Oscars parties

<p>The 2020 Academy Awards will be my seventh. I’ve yet to win one but I’ve brought home some great stories</p><p>When you read this, I will be in Los Angeles, which is nice. I love LA, which is not a sentence you hear often, especially in Britain, where the city is often derided as too shallow, too full of celebrities and too hot, none of which are negatives in my book. The British antipathy to LA is rooted in a suspicion that anything that pleasant can’t be good for you, and an experience only counts if it involves endurance. I’ve spent the past 20 summers hacking it out at British festivals, trudging through mud with a rucksack the size of a car on my back, all in the name of Fun. So the first time I went to Coachella in California’s Palm Springs I thought I was hallucinating, like when Tintin gets so dehydrated he fantasises a sparkling oasis surrounded by palm trees, because that is what Coachella looks like. As I sat on the perfect green grass, eating my acai bowl, I remembered when Brits grumped that Glastonbury was getting gentrified because there were flushable toilets. Britain’s self-image is rooted in 1970s sitcoms, whereas California believes life should be like a Hollywood movie.</p><p>And sometimes it actually is. I’m out here to cover the Oscars for, I think, the seventh time. I know this is deeply uncool to admit but, hot damn, I love the Oscars. Even as a kid one of my most beloved video cassettes was called Oscars Greatest Moments, but attending them has taken matters to a new level. I’ve yet to win an Oscar, but it is at the awards where I’ve lived out some of the great movie storylines. Behold, <em>my</em> Oscars Greatest Moments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/my-life-in-oscars-parties-colin-firth-hadley-freeman">Continue reading...</a>

## To the Lake by Kapka Kassabova review – a dive into dark Balkan waters

<p>What lurks beneath? Swimming and sinister stories in a thrilling ancestral quest to Lakes Ohrid and Prespa</p><p>A travel writer’s journey is often centrifugal in its bearing, from the known to the unknown; but the journey itself has the effect of inaugurating a new centre – a river’s source, a mountain’s peak, a remote island or fabled city. In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kapka-kassabova" title="">Kapka Kassabova</a>’s book, the destination is a lake – or rather two connected lakes, Ohrid and Prespa, on the Balkan peninsula. “Sometimes,” she notes, “history’s thoroughfares are disguised as geography’s outposts.” It’s a region she visited on childhood holidays, but never as an adult, sensing that she “wasn’t ready”.</p><p>As with her last book, the superb <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/08/border-by-kapka-kassabova-review" title=""><em>Border</em></a>, the destination is also a tripartite political frontier. The journey is a search for an ancestral home, something forsaken – the “lacustrine realm” her grandmother Anastasia left as a young woman and felt agonisingly, debilitatingly drawn back to. In that sense, <em>To the Lake</em> is a classic account of the exile (albeit at a remove) seeking completion through return. “Geography shapes history – we generally accept this as a fact,” Kassabova writes in her introduction. “But we don’t often explore how families digest big historio-geographies, how these sculpt our inner landscape.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/08/to-the-lake-kapka-kassabova-review-balkan-water-cure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The number of landlords with multiple properties is falling as cuts to tax relief bite</p><p>The two decades of fat, lazy profits made on the backs of squeezing as much rental cash as possible out of young adults while smugly sitting on vast unearned house price gains look to be over. This April the final phase of the tax changes on buy-to-let income comes into force, and the good news is that landlords are giving up on the game.</p><p>HMRC data obtained by accountants Moore this week show that the number of buy-to-let landlords with multiple properties fell in 2017-18 to 157,000 from 159,000 the year before.

<p>The youngest winner of the Forward prize and author of viral sensation ‘dear white America’, Smith is back with a deeply personal collection, Homie</p><p>• Plus read an extract from Homie below</p><p>Danez Smith was born into a devout Baptist household in St Paul, Minnesota. Smith’s grandmother still lives there, in one of only two black households on a street that was mixed but is becoming increasingly white. Smith grew up, on this border between the blacker areas and the white middle-class enclaves of the city, as a black, queer, God-fearing child.</p><p>The future poet and spoken-word artist would listen to family members and friends telling stories on the porch, impressed by their way with words. The friends came and went but there was always one constant: church. Smith may have struggled to fit in among the congregation but Sunday morning meant worship, and more importantly a sermon. It was that rousing religious oration that opened up the world of writing and performance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/08/danez-smith-interview-white-people-racism-homie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A musky scent is the equivalent of a silk slip and a dirty weekend</p><p>If a sweet, romantic, floral perfume is the olfactory equivalent of roses and a heart-shaped chocolate box, then a musky scent is a silk slip and a dirty weekend. Soft, mysterious, sensuous and animalic musks (synthetically produced in almost all modern commercial perfumes) make a less obvious Valentine’s gift.</p><p>Narciso Rodriguez’s fragrances are, I believe, among the very best in the mid-price bracket. His original, carnal For Her is perfection, and the fairly new <strong><a href="https://www.theperfumeshop.com/narciso-rodriguez/pure-musc/eau-de-parfum-for-her/p/12750EDPJU" title="">Pure Musc</a></strong> (£45, 30ml) is a worthy little sibling (and, in fact, layers beautifully under the original, should you be so inclined). This is a creamy, slightly chillier musk than the original – more clean sheets than hot skin – and smells fresher than my other picks. But don’t let its lightness deceive you – it lasts terrifically well and works politely in daytime, whereas many musks are night crawlers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/08/the-sexiest-scents-for-valentines-day-perfume-sali-hughes">Continue reading...</a>

Defeat at Murrayfield by Gregor Townsend’s side would all but end World Cup finalists’ hopes of winning Six Nations title<p>It is the stark contrast in backdrops that makes the Six Nations so compelling.

The oldest contest in world rugby is always a good test of character, particularly when the English head north in a year with a zero at the end of it.</p><p>The grand old stories of 1990, in particular, remain as popular as ever, even though most of Saturday’s combatants were not even born when David Sole and his side made their famously slow walk out on to the Murrayfield turf.

<p>The actor has channelled Bob Dylan and received an honour at just 29. Now she’s finally ready for primetime</p><p>Sheila Atim would not call it a shrine, exactly, but in her London flat, there is a mantelpiece on which she has placed a few commemorative bits and bobs. There’s an Olivier award here, an MBE there. “My friend <em>did</em> say it looked like a shrine,” she admits, laughing. “But it’s not because I want people to walk into the flat and be blinded by the lights of Sheila’s achievements. These things are just nice! They’re little milestones. I look at them and go, whoa. What?!”</p><p>There’s a lovely, knockabout energy to Atim, balanced by a deeply serious side. More than almost anyone I’ve interviewed, she really, properly, thoroughly considers every angle of every question she is asked, as if she’s been set a puzzle to solve. Perhaps that’s why casting agents spot a kind of otherworldliness in her. “A little bit, not bang in the middle of the mainstream, just slightly to the left,” as she puts it. Atim has been a powerful presence in the theatre world: she won the Olivier in 2018 for her role in the Bob Dylan-inspired musical <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jul/27/girl-from-the-north-country-review-bob-dylan-conor-mcpherson" title="">Girl From </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jul/27/girl-from-the-north-country-review-bob-dylan-conor-mcpherson" title="">The North Country</a>, and has done almost every interesting, just-slightly-to-the-left production of Shakespeare going. Then, in December, she was awarded the MBE – at the age of 29. Now she’s moving on to the small screen with a BBC primetime debut in which she’ll be playing a witch. In <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0819xlg" title="">The Pale Horse</a>, a list of names is found on the body of a woman who has been murdered; a man who finds his own name there becomes obsessed with a trio of spooky women in a leafy suburban village. It’s an Agatha Christie adaptation, which means Atim can’t tell me anything else about it. “It’s quite hard, isn’t it, with a whodunnit? But I am playing a witch. That much I can tell you.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/08/sheila-atim-impostor-syndrome-mbe-bbc-debut-agatha-christie-pale-horse">Continue reading...</a>

A fatuous reality TV star leads refugees on a televised exodus from Africa to Germany in this fascinating ‘what-if?’ novel<p>It’s the near future, and Europe has closed its borders firmly to refugees. A vast permanent camp has grown in sub-Saharan Africa, sustained (just) by western aid. But its inhabitants are stuck: even those who are able to earn find it pointless to save. The prices charged by people-smugglers are going up faster than the refugees can make money, and the days of risking it all in a dinghy on the Mediterranean are long gone.</p><p>That’s the premise of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/30/look-whos-back-timur-vermes-review" title="">Timur Vermes</a>’s hefty new novel, and what sets the action off is the arrival of an airhead German reality TV star, Nadeche Hackenbusch, who flies to the camp to film a series of her show, Angel in Adversity. She arrives with a personal makeup artist, a pink zebra-striped car and a supply of her line of Hackenpush-up bras to hand out to the needy. There she meets “Lionel” (so named by the TV people after he says something mystic-sounding about lions), a young refugee recruited as her on-camera fixer and shortly afterwards as her lover. Their romance is tracked by a compliant journalist called Astrid who files copy like this:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/08/hungry-fat-timur-vermes-review-refugees-germany">Continue reading...</a>

## Is the Democratic race really just down to Sanders and Buttigieg now? | Moira Donegan

<p>Friday’s Democratic debate was pitched as a battle between the centrist and the left-wing candidate. But that’s not quite how it played out<br /></p><p>Heading into Friday night’s Democratic debate, the media had effectively declared that the Democratic primary was down to only two viable candidates: Mayor Pete Buttigieg, of South Bend, Indiana, and Senator Bernie Sanders, of Vermont. Monday’s Iowa caucuses had ended with the two candidates effectively tied after disastrous and seemingly systemic incompetence drew out the reporting process for days. The debate in New Hampshire was pitched as a contest between them, a bid to see which would prevail – the moderate, big money-backed Buttigieg, or the grassroots financing juggernaught of the progressive Sanders. Prognoses pitched the debate as a battle between the party’s ideological factions, and speculated at how the two men would attack each other, and which would prevail.</p><p>But the five other candidates onstage had other plans. Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, attacked Buttigieg fiercely and repeatedly. The moderate Senator is competing with the mayor for the Democratic party’s right flank, and it made strategic sense for her to go after the man stealing away what she sees as her most likely voters. But there was also what seemed like a degree of sincere personal contempt in Klobuchar’s remarks toward Buttigieg. She has remarked before that his youth and inexperience would not be overlooked so easily in a woman candidate, and her comments on his inconsistent positions and lack of national experience carried with them a sting of anger at his arrogance and easy rise to the top of the polls. The exchanges highlighted Klobuchar’s refreshing authenticity, coming as they did on a stage full of people who are very practiced in saying things they do not mean. This combined with a ready sense of humor made Klobuchar a more charismatic figure on stage than many of her competitors, even as her policy positions continue to tend toward the unimaginative, uninspired, and unambitious, and threaten to reproduce ongoing cruelties.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/08/is-the-democratic-primary-really-just-down-to-sanders-and-buttigieg-now">Continue reading...</a>

## Love is (still) in the air: how the romcom came back from the dead

<p>After decades of dominance, the romcom became a succession of tired cliches. But thanks to streaming – and more diverse casting – it’s back on our screens</p><p>The romcom was dead and buried. Matthew McConaughey had leaned against his final wall and Kate Hudson had been the recipient of her last grand romantic gesture. Even Hugh Grant had sworn off them, claiming he was “too old and ugly”, as movie studios abandoned dashes through airport security and beautiful but clumsy women tripping over pavement kerbs.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2002, the romcom, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/sleepless-in-seattle">Sleepless in Seattle</a> (1993) to As Good As It Gets (1997) to My Big Fat Greek Wedding (2002), reigned supreme.

## Misinformation on the coronavirus might be the most contagious thing about it | Adam Kucharski

<p>And the best way to tackle these online rumours? Treat them like a real-life virus<br /><br />• Adam Kucharski is an epidemiologist and author</p><p>When reports of a new coronavirus emerged last month, I speculated with fellow epidemiologists about what the media might end up naming the infection. None of us would have guessed that within a week or so a theory would be circulating that coronavirus was a new kind of<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wuhan-coronavirus-snake-flu-theory/" title=""> “snake flu”</a>– mostly because it’s unlikely the virus originated in snakes, and it’s not flu.</p><p>So where did the snakes come from? The culprit was a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmv.25682" title="">widely shared scientific paper</a>, which speculated that the new virus had genetic characteristics and implicated snakes as the source. Leading geneticists were quick to point out that the results weren’t convincing, and that bats were still the likely suspects. However, that didn’t stop snake flu from going viral. Other misinformation about coronavirus has rippled across the internet in recent weeks. From claims the virus is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.30.927871v1" title="">part-HIV</a> to <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/02/russian-disinformation-coronavirus/" title="">conspiracy theories about bioweapons</a> and reports suggesting the virus was linked to people eating <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7920573/Revolting-footage-shows-Chinese-woman-eating-bat-scientists-link-coronavirus-animal.html" title="">bat soup</a>, stories sparking fear seem to have overtaken the outbreak in real life.

<p>Growing up in a big family was intense, chaotic and character-forming. This is what it taught me</p><p>If you have siblings, the chances are that your relationship with them will be the longest you ever have with anyone. It’s a tie that precedes the one you have with you partner, and that can last long after your parents and friends have gone.</p><p>So why is so little attention paid to the brother and sister bond? The majority of sibling self-help books are aimed at parents who have young children locked in rivalry. Very little is written for adult siblings on how to maintain a healthy relationship. Michelle Qureshi, a London-based therapist, tells me she has seen a rise in the number of people seeking sibling counselling. “People no longer stay in the same area or live close to their extended families,” she says. “Busy schedules mean we don’t see each other as often as we used to. Sibling relationships can be intense and we set high expectations on them – so when they break, they can be difficult to resolve.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/08/power-of-six-what-i-have-learned-from-having-five-siblings">Continue reading...</a>
