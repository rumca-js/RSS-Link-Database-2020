I recorded a time-lapse of my three-room 3/4" hardwood flooring install, and narrated some of the tips and process I used to do it. From ripping out the old carpet and parquet to installing Aquabar 'B' underlayment, nailing a cleat in the middle, installing flooring, reversing the direction with a spline, finishing up the outside edges with a finish nailer, and finally completing the base molding and shoe molding, I have the whole process documented with the help of my little Raspberry Pi-powered timelapse!
