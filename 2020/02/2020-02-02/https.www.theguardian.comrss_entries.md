<ul><li>Australian Open champion could be fined for violation</li><li>‘It was a nice, really friendly touch,’ says Serbian player</li></ul><p>Novak Djokovic does not believe he crossed the line touching the chair umpire during a volatile Australian Open final on Sunday night. The Serb is facing the prospect of a hefty fine for twice tapping Damien Dumusois on the foot while remonstrating with the French official during his drama-charged five-set win over Dominic Thiem.</p><p>The Serbian lost his cool when he was handed back-to-back time violations in the one game for taking too long to serve. With the score locked at 4-4 in the second set, the second penalty came at break point and cost him a first serve, with Djokovic losing the game.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/03/australian-open-tennis-novak-djokovic-umpire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sam Mendes’ sweep goes some way to making amends for the awards’ now-notorious nomination shutouts – but I still can’t get onboard with the love for Todd Phillips’ cackling standup </p><p>So the 2020 Baftas were a mixed bag, reviled in advance for their dull Dulux uniformity, with some pretty mediocre product being bewilderingly promoted and great directors overlooked. But there were some great films getting rewarded too.</p><p>For me, it is wonderful to see best film, director and outstanding British film go to Sam Mendes for 1917, co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns. This drama from the first world war’s western front has passion and sweep, and its director of photography Roger Deakins was always going to be a shoo-in for the cinematography Bafta for his amazing camerawork, fabricating the illusion of a continuous unbroken shot following the ordeal of two terrified British soldiers as they journey through no man’s land and across vacated German lines on a desperate mission to warn their comrades of an enemy trap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/1917-deserves-baftass-thunderous-applause-joker-does-not">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The solar system’s innermost planet can never be seen in the night sky.

The innermost planet, Mercury’s orbit is just 0.38 times the size of Earth. Being that close to the sun means that we can never see the planet in the night sky but at certain times of the year we can catch a glimpse of it in the twilight. For the next two weeks, Mercury will be visible in the evening as dusk is falling. To see it, a clear south-western horizon will be needed but at least the bright planet Venus is on hand to act as guide. The chart shows the view looking south-west towards Venus at 1730GMT on 3 February. There will be no other stars visible at this time, only Venus and Mercury will shine through the twilight sky. Mercury is much more of a challenge from the southern hemisphere. From Sydney, Australia, Venus will be to the north of Mercury, which just peeps above the western horizon around 2030 AEDT.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/feb/02/starwatch-seasonal-chance-to-glimpse-mercury">Continue reading...</a>

But one company is hoping fine diners from London to LA to Tokyo will devour enough <em>uni sushi</em> – sea urchin roe – to help restore the planet’s kelp forests.</p><p>From the North Sea to Tasmania, large parts of these underwater carbon stores – crucial for biodiversity – have vanished, leaving vast “urchin barrens” on the sea floor in their place. In Norway, the expanses of bizarre, prickly orbs are green. In California, they are purple.

<p>With its ambitious scale and gory deaths, this windswept, sci-fi take on Love Actually was another win for Chibnall-era Who<br /></p><p>Welcome, as normal service resumes following last week’s spoiler-related hiccups. After the <a href="https://theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/27/doctor-who-recap-series-38-episode-five-fugitive-of-the-judoon">revelations and reveals of Fugitive of the Judoon</a>, this week, perhaps wisely, dials back on all that. There’s no mention of the mysterious Ruth Doctor. But Praxeus is breathless nonetheless, another standout episode in the Chris Chibnall era, which has found its feet after a stumbling start. <br /><br />The writers, Pete McTighe and Chibnall, once again play with the format; the episode begins with the “fam” already separated on separate missions, the Doctor having sent them off on errands (it’s normally at least the 10-minute mark before the companions get separated). But troubling events spanning London, Peru, Madagascar, Hong Kong and beyond, taking in a doomed astronaut and his deadbeat husband, a shifty scientist and two annoying travel bloggers, turn out to be connected. People are exploding and the birds are going haywire. As the disparate strands connect, it turns into a kind of twisted sci-fi Love Actually. <br /><br />Praxeus shows off a scale rarely witnessed in Doctor Who – with a large and diverse guest cast – and convincingly stitches everything together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/02/doctor-who-recap-series-38-episode-six-praxeus">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Trump’s impeachment trial: the perils of outrageous immunity | Editorial

In looking the other way over the president’s corruption and lawbreaking, the Republican party has offered up its soul in exchange for power<p>The line that best sums up last week’s Senate impeachment trial of Donald Trump probably comes from the lips of Omar Little, the stickup artist who robs drug dealers in HBO’s the Wire. “You come at the king,” <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/12/you-come-at-the-king-you-best-not-miss/67251/" title="">warned</a> Mr Little “you best not miss”. The truth came for Mr Trump but after the smoke cleared <a href="https://cdn.newseum.org/dfp/pdf1/NY_NYT.pdf" title="">on Friday</a>, the president was still standing. He remains in the Oval Office because almost every Republican senator preferred being in power to upholding the democratic principles upon which the US was founded. By Wednesday Mr Trump will have defied justice. He will then be free to continue his campaign of grievance and resentment safe in the knowledge that there is no genuine check on his executive overreach.</p><p>The Grand Old Party has offered up its soul in exchange for Mr Trump’s gutting of environmental regulations, appointing conservative judges and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/oct/09/trump-tax-cuts-helped-billionaires-pay-less" title="">cutting taxes for the rich</a>. GOP representatives are repeatedly caught looking the other way over Mr Trump’s corruption, lawbreaking and manifest unfitness for office. They do so in part because if they did speak out, they risk being “<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/the-center-of-the-orbit-endangered-republicans-go-all-in-on-trump/2020/01/31/154b2b38-4376-11ea-aa6a-083d01b3ed18_story.html" title="">primaried</a>” by pro-Trump Republicans. Jeff Flake, an ex-Republican senator, thought “<a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/09/27/jeff-flake-at-least-35-gop-senators-would-impeach-trump/3792866002/" title="">at least 35</a>” former colleagues would vote to convict the president and have him removed from office if there were a secret vote.

<p>It was meeting a collie called Hey Hey, a direct descendant of the first dog to play Lassie, that gave author and film journalist Wendy Mitchell the idea for her new book, <em>Citizen Canine: Dogs in the Movies</em>. “I would melt into floods of tears when I saw a dog on screen,” she says, and so she created a book celebrating famous dog performances in Hollywood history, from Chaplin’s co-star Scraps in <em>A Dog’s Life</em> to the great Dane in <em>Marmaduke</em>. After spending a year watching dog films, Mitchell believes animals on screen should be recognised more, and calls on Bafta and the Oscars to have a best animal award category. She describes how dogs provoke emotions in humans, but their own feelings are “magic” when captured on film, citing the mutt in the 1974 classic <em>Benji</em> whose “big brown eyes” could show so much. “Even that old curmudgeon Alfred Hitchcock confessed he was a big Benji fan,” she says.</p><p><a href="https://www.laurenceking.com/"><em>Citizen Canine: Dogs in the Movies</em> <em>is out now (£12.99, Laurence King)</em></a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2020/feb/02/hollywood-hounds-canine-film-stars-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

Or it became the 2019 version of a fact: something we all (myself included) absorb after reading viral headlines on Facebook.</p><p>There’s certainly some truth to it. Studies from around the world have shown a moderate decline in sexual activity; a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/trends/2015_us_sexual_trend_yrbs.pdf">US survey</a> found that between 1991 and 2017, the number of high school students having sexual intercourse dropped from 54% to 40%. In a fascinating cover story, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/">the Atlantic</a> put a name to the phenomenon, and the story stuck: young people are “retreating from intimacy”.

To come back at his age and do it on the number one stage, that’s fantastic.”</p><p>Leopardstown agreed. The grandstand emptied as soon as Faugheen crossed the line half a length in front of Easy Game, a stable companion who is half his age, to acclaim their returning hero just 14 months on from a horrible fall at the same course which left him on the turf for two agonising minutes. Twelve-year-old Grade One winners are a great rarity – only Sizing Europe (2014 Punchestown Champion Chase) and Florida Pearl, in the 2004 Irish Gold Cup, have achieved the feat in recent decades. Victory in a Grade One novice event at such an advance age is more astonishing still and Faugheen’s connections must now decide whether to attempt an unprecedented double at Cheltenham next month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/02/delta-work-irish-gold-cup-gordon-elliott-faugheen-leopardstown-horse-racing-tips">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Royal Festival Hall, London</strong><br />Vladimir Jurowski and the LPO bring energy, tautness and dramatic fire to the third part of Wagner’s Ring, raising the bar with an astonishing performance</p><p>The London Philharmonic’s Ring with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/vladimir-jurowski">Vladimir Jurowski</a> goes, it would seem, from strength to strength. Presenting one opera a year, they have now reached Siegfried, though when Götterdämmerung is added in 2021 it will form part of two performances of the complete cycle. So far, the bar has beeen raised with each instalment, conductor and orchestra becoming more fully immersed in each successive work. Though, as with the previous operas, there are occasional vocal inequalities, much of this can only be described as a thing of wonder, generating a fierce excitement that on occasion took my breath away.</p><p>Jurowski has, if anything, refined and honed his approach to Wagner over time. As with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/28/das-rheingold-review-jurowski-lpo-royal-festival-hall-ring-cycle">Das Rheingold</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jan/28/die-walkure-review-royal-festival-hall-london-vladimir-jurowski-london-philharmonic-orchestra">Die Walküre</a>, his judgement of the relationship between speed and pace, and his ability to hold us in the moment while thinking in terms of cumulative span, remains immaculate. Here, in what has often been dubbed the Ring’s “scherzo”, there was perhaps greater energy, tautness and dramatic fire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/siegfried-review-royal-festival-hall-london-richard-wagner-vladimir-jurowski-london-philharmonic-orchestra">Continue reading...</a>

But, with breastfeeding burning about 300 calories a day, this is not the time to cut calories. “As you’ll be feeding through the night as well as the day, it may be an idea to take a tuck box to bed,” says Moffett.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/02/five-ways-to-stay-healthy-when-breastfeeding">Continue reading...</a>

<p>US biotech companies are working towards plasma therapies to tackle age-related diseases in humans</p><p>In the early 2000s a group of scientists at Stanford University, California, revived a grisly procedure used in the 1950s known as parabiosis. They paired living mice, young with old, peeled back their skin and stitched together their sides so the two animals shared the same blood circulatory system. A month later, they found signs of rejuvenation in the muscles and livers of the old mice. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03260" title="">The findings</a>, published in 2005, turned the minds of scientists, entrepreneurs and the public to the potential of young blood to rejuvenate ageing people. By 2016, enough interest had grown to prompt a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/shortcuts/2017/aug/21/ambrosia-the-startup-harvesting-the-blood-of-the-young" title="">US-based startup called Ambrosia</a> to start offering pricey infusions of young plasma – the cell-free component of blood. The procedure <a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/statement-fda-commissioner-scott-gottlieb-md-and-director-fdas-center-biologics-evaluation-and-0" title="">came under fire</a> from the US Food and Drug Administration early last year both for its lack of proven clinical benefit and for potential safety issues; Ambrosia closed, though it has recently reopened.</p><p>Meanwhile, a clutch of scientific startups are trying to discover the secrets of parabiosis and use them to tackle age-related disease. By identifying factors in plasma that change with age, they aim to create therapies that either supplement what’s beneficial in young blood or to inhibit what’s detrimental in old. One is even beginning to report early clinical trial results.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/02/could-young-blood-stop-us-getting-old-transfusions-experiments-mice-plasma">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Magical realism meets real life in the acclaimed journalist’s debut novel about American slaves escaping to the north</p><p>A former national correspondent for the <em>Atlantic</em> magazine, Ta-Nehisi Coates is among the most revered and widely read intellectuals in the US. His bleak but scintillating book about race, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/18/we-were-eight-years-in-power-ta-nehisi-coates-review" title=""><em>We </em><em>Were Eight Years in Power</em></a> (2017), was a passionate collection of essays focusing on the sharp divisions and overpowering emotions – from uplifting to ugly – that surfaced when Barack Obama became his country’s first black president. What white America fears most is black competence, Coates reasoned. Black excellence turns that fear into paranoia.</p><p>Coates alerted readers to his talents two years earlier with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/19/national-book-awards-ta-nehisi-coates-politics-poetry-short-stories" title="">National Book award-winning</a> <em>Between the World and Me</em>, a letter to his then 14-year-old son in which he warned about the perils of being African American.

It was a strikingly low number, but maybe not surprising. For decades, menswear’s slow adaptiveness on the red carpet has felt positively <em>glacial</em> next to women’s.

<p>A sudden bereavement tore my life apart. But even though I’m a trained therapist, I couldn’t find comfort on the couch</p><p>Five years ago I flew over the Connecticut hospital mortuary where thousands of feet below my husband’s dead body lay. The map on the screen flashed up New Haven as we headed east over the Atlantic… leaving him behind. During the six-hour flight back to London I sat bolt upright, tearless and unable to eat, drink or even visit the loo. I felt nothing, utterly empty, numb and as close to inanimate as I imagine a person can feel.</p><p>Andrew, at just 52, had died at 8am that morning, killed by a vicious land grabber of a cancer that had taken 14 months to overwhelm every organ in his body. This was my trauma beginning, to be followed, inevitably, by grief. We knew from the start it was bad, but I didn’t somehow think he would actually die. We never discussed it. Now, this seems astounding to me. I am still perplexed by the strength of his denial. And by my complicity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/02/im-a-psychotherapist-but-therapy-didnt-help-my-grief-bereavement">Continue reading...</a>

While Lena Waithe’s script (on which author/producer James Frey shares a story credit) may veer occasionally into narrative contrivance, there’s an emotional honesty to the central love story that rings true despite the odd note of implausibility – a sense of powerful, magical potential that burns out any first-feature flaws.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/02/queen-and-slim-review-daniel-kaluuya-jodie-turner-smith">Continue reading...</a>

He was invited there by a curator whose stipulation was that he make work on the theme of sex and mortality.</p><p>“Mexico’s anarchic, visceral energy got under my skin and sucked me in,” he recalls. “There is an acceptance that life has no glorious victory, no happy ending. Humour, ritual, a strong sense of community and an embrace of the inevitable make it possible to live with tragic and often unacceptable situations.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/02/pieter-hugo-la-cucaracha-mexico-the-big-picture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On the site of the old Scotland Yard building, some of the prices feel like daylight robbery</p><p><strong>The Yard by Robin Gill, 3-5 Great Scotland Yard, London SW1A 2HN (020 7925 4749). Starters £14-£16, mains £26-£30, desserts £9.50, wines from £38</strong></p><p>Dangling on a chain from the waitress’s outfits at the <a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/england-united-kingdom/great-scotland-yard/lhrub/dining" title="">Yard </a><a href="https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/england-united-kingdom/great-scotland-yard/lhrub/dining" title="">by Robin Gill</a>, the restaurant tucked inside the new Great Scotland Yard Hotel just off London’s Whitehall, is a knuckle-duster. We ask to weigh one in our hand. It’s the real thing: a solid piece of brass designed for rupturing skin and fracturing bone in a moment of ultra-violence. It’s a nasty weapon repurposed as an oh-so-witty fashion accessory. I suggest you consider that a symbol for everything that’s wrong about this unappealing, ill-conceived and graspingly overpriced catering operation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/02/the-yard-by-robin-gill-london-unappealing-ill-conceived-overpriced-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For all the critical acclaim, happiness for the US folk-rocker is a home of her own, a cat and a newfound calm</p><p>A few years ago, following the release of her widely acclaimed 2016 album, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/sep/04/angel-olsen-my-woman-review-shut-up-kiss-me" title="">My Woman</a></em>, <a href="https://angelolsen.com/" title="">Angel Olsen</a> started noticing celebrities turning up at her live shows.</p><p>Christina Hendricks, of <em>Mad Men</em> fame, came to a concert in Los Angeles and swayed along to Olsen’s smouldering, deeply felt folk-rock. She stuck around to say hello afterwards, as did the actor Brie Larson, who proved herself to be, in Olsen’s assessment, “super down-to-earth and really normal and just chill”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/02/angel-olsen-i-dont-want-to-be-a-pop-star-all-mirrors-interview">Continue reading...</a>
