## Barcelona crisis grows as Athletic Bilbao knock them out of Copa del Rey

<p>• Athletic Bilbao 1-0 Barcelona<br />• Iñaki Williams’ late goal knocks out Barça after calamitous week</p><p>Athletic Bilbao poured fuel on Barcelona’s fire. A late, late goal exposed them once more, eliminated from the Copa del Rey in the week in which their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/05/lionel-messi-barcelona-eric-abidal-patience-snapped" title="">captain publicly called out their sporting director</a>, divisions coming to the surface, civil war declared, the collapse complete. Lionel Messi had accused Eric Abidal of “dirtying” the players. Here, offered the chance to make a point with their play, they did so themselves. “Talk to me about the football, please,” their coach, Quique Setién, said before this game but, when it came to the football, it was not much better. There was no hiding place on the field. At San Mamés their players were thrown to the lions again. And what awaits them now may be even worse.</p><p>A 94th-minute goal from Iñaki Williams defeated Barcelona in the quarter-final of the Copa del Rey. Obviously they will not win the cup but it takes a leap of faith to believe they will win anything at all. The crisis continues, deeper now. It is institutional but it is sporting, too. Though Unai Simón saved Athletic a couple of times, Barcelona could not really claim they deserved better. They could have won but they could also have been beaten sooner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/06/barcelona-crisis-grows-athletic-bilbao-copa-del-rey">Continue reading...</a>

It was already evident that Republicans would not hold the president accountable. Now it is up to Democrats, and the electorate<p>Not all battles are fought in the belief that they will be won. Some are fought in the belief that conceding in advance would be even worse. Democrats knew Donald Trump was unlikely to be convicted by a Republican Senate when they launched impeachment proceedings; that he would erroneously claim, as he has done, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/05/donald-trump-acquitted-senate-impeachment-trial" title="">“full exoneration”</a>; and that he would use the case to fire up his base. He may feel he is indestructible, as his lie-packed State of the Union address and Thursday’s buoyant, bizarre, rambling speech <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/feb/06/donald-trump-speech-impeachment-verdict-romney-buttigieg-sanders-biden-live-latest-news" title="">about the “evil” process</a> suggests. He looks forward to November as the first impeached president to run for re-election.</p><p>Yet a refusal to impeach him would itself have damaged the country’s constitutional protections; and a president who knew he would never face impeachment would likely be as emboldened <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/05/groans-walkouts-trump-state-of-the-union-sketch" title="">as the one who has faced it down</a>. The vote to acquit was not a vindication of the president’s conduct, any more than the farce of the Senate trial – in which jurors who had sworn to be impartial refused to even hear witnesses – amounted to justice in action. It was an indictment of the Republican party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/06/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-acquittal-over-to-the-voters">Continue reading...</a>

While campaigns targeted at women have changed hugely in the past 20 years – with campaigns such as Dove's Campaign for Real Beauty changing the images of beauty for women – men's adverts haven't had the same transformation. Iman speaks to those in the advertising industry who are working to change the way we see men in adverts.

<p>As the coronavirus has spread to four continents, Laura Spinney chooses scientific studies, memoirs and novels about Aids, TB, polio and Spanish flu</p><p>With cases of coronavirus reported on four continents, health experts are concerned it could become a pandemic. The world is currently in the grip of two others – Aids and tuberculosis – while measles is on the rise again and polio stubbornly resists eradication. When smallpox was wiped out, some in the medical community were so high on their success they thought other infectious diseases would soon be licked. Fifty years later, this triumph remains unique.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/11/spillover-animal-infections-pandemic-quammen-review" title="">David Quammen’s <strong>Spillover</strong></a> serves as a rousing wake-up call, because he conjures up the complex web of microbial ecosystems through which humanity stumbles blindly. Mostly the microbes mind their own business, but occasionally we blunder into their finely tuned arrangements for survival and provoke the spillover of a pathogen from its usual animal host to us. It takes time for them to find a sustainable way to colonise their new host, or hosts, so the initial fallout can be carnage – a trail of gorilla carcasses in an African forest, for example, that heralds an outbreak of Ebola in people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/06/best-books-about-pandemics">Continue reading...</a>

Generally speaking, I don’t: if it’s something Liam Fox wants, then I most probably do not want it, and that’s good enough for me.

Despondent lefties need not despair – a modern manifesto to expand the non‑capitalist space bit by bit<p>Early 2020 is either a very good or a very bad time to publish a book about why socialism is the answer to the world’s problems. Bad for reasons that, if you’re British, don’t need rehearsing; good because with every awful news cycle capitalism looks less and less able to provide most people with a decent, sustainable life. Also, as even arch-capitalist publications such as the Economist acknowledge, there has been a recent upsurge of fresh thinking on the left, particularly in Britain and the US. The problem for socialists is not a lack of exciting ideas, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-a-green-new-deal-we-need-it-now" title="">the green new deal</a>, but how to persuade voters that they are relevant and practical.</p><p>Gilbert’s daringly short book is an attempt to rectify that. In half a dozen quick chapters, with lightly sketched examples and a minimum of jargon, it covers three huge topics: how capitalism came into being, and what’s wrong with it; how socialism developed during the 19th and 20th centuries as an alternative way of organising society; and how an updated, contemporary version could be drawn together, successfully presented during and between elections, and then put into practice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/06/twenty-first-century-socialism-by-jeremy-gilbert-review">Continue reading...</a>

## Inside the mind of Dominic Cummings

<p>He is now the country’s de facto project manager, but what does he actually believe? In a bid to find out, I read (almost) everything Cummings has written in the last decade. By Stefan Collini</p><p>When the prime minister of the day describes you as a “career psychopath”, your chances of preferment in the political world may not seem rosy. When associates of a leading minister refer to you as “that jumped-up oik”, you may sense you’re not winning friends in high places. When a senior official in the department where you are employed calls you “a mutant virus”, you may feel less than wholly accepted. And when a prominent MP in the party you work for denounces you as “an unelected foul-mouthed oaf”, it may seem that the game is up. Furnished with these testimonials, some downsizing of career ambitions may appear to be in order.</p><p>But Dominic Cummings has never played by the rules, and now, as Boris Johnson’s de facto chief-of-staff, he has become perhaps the most powerful unelected political figure in the country. He thus has an exceptional opportunity to put his ideas into practice. But what are his ideas? Commentators seem vaguely aware that, although he studied history at university, he has dabbled in more than one scientific discipline over the years, but no one, it appears, has really tried to take the measure of Cummings as a serious thinker.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/feb/06/inside-the-mind-of-dominic-cummings-brexit-boris-johnson-conservatives">Continue reading...</a>

Because if you pick up enough strangers, sooner or later, an unfortunate incident will unfold. Or, as Starr warns in the video: <em>“</em>Some crazy motherfuckers are going to act up in your Uber.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/06/uber-rideshare-lyft-safety-crime">Continue reading...</a>

## Corey Feldman: ‘Nobody wants to go after the bad guys’

<p>The 80s teen star is known for odd, even sleazy behaviour. Is that why his claims of film industry paedophilia are not taken seriously?</p><p>At first glance, Corey Feldman’s house looks ridiculous. A crooked Christmas wreath hangs on the front door, even though it is late January. Feldman’s assistant lets me into the two-storey home in the hills of Los Angeles, and when I walk into the living room I have to bite the insides of my cheeks to stop myself from gasping: hanging above the fireplace is a drawing of Feldman from his 80s teen glory years. The bookcases are packed with vintage toys, most still in their boxes, most from Feldman’s own movies: there’s Goonies merch, Gremlins memorabilia, The Lost Boys souvenirs. And, of course, there are the inevitable posters of his films, including License to Drive and Stand By Me. It’s like a parody of how one might imagine a former child star’s house to look: one part Neverland to two parts Norma Desmond. I haven’t even mentioned the picture of Michael Jackson – with whom Feldman was friends as a child – in the front hallway, greeting you as you walk past.</p><p>I was a big Feldman fan back in the day, and maintain that his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNkPDbARQZo" title="">performance</a> in Stand By Me equals River Phoenix’s more acclaimed one. But standing in his living room I find myself doing what most others do about Feldman these days: “Look at this guy,” I think, giving in to the siren call of snark. “What a joke!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/06/corey-feldman-nobody-wants-to-go-after-the-bad-guys">Continue reading...</a>

What have the last 10 years taught me?</p><p>One thing I wish I’d understood more fully at the beginning is the importance – and the fleeting nature – of those tender, challenging early years. Like many modern parents, I embarked on the most important job of my life with 100% enthusiasm but zero knowledge or experience. I’d spent my entire life, in fact, training for something completely different: I knew how to pass exams; I knew how to talk my way into a profession (and out of one); I had been trained from childhood to value academic achievement and professional success. I was completely bemused and befuddled to find myself trapped in my flat, tending to the needs of a small, speechless human.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/06/early-years-support-priority-sure-start">Continue reading...</a>

Svetlana is a small village four hours away from St Petersburg. Around 40 people live there in four large houses organised around a farm with a dairy, a bakery and a sauna. The community was established in 1992 as part of the international <a href="https://camphillfoundation.org/">Camphill movement</a>.</p><p>Based on the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthroposophy">anthroposophy</a>, the latter was founded in Scotland in 1939. There is now a network of more than 100 residential communities around the world providing care for people with disabilities, mental health issues and other special needs. They make up the majority of the people who live in Svetlana. Then there are permanent members of staff and volunteers, who come from all over the world to help. But everyone there is simply referred to as a resident. The village receives occasional governmental funding but is mostly sustained by private donations and subsistence farming. Residents work on the farm, or in the bakery, selling cheese curds and the like to neighbouring villages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/06/mary-gelman-best-photograph-love-downs-syndrome-camphill-svetlana-village">Continue reading...</a>
