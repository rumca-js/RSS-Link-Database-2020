Following the strange success of the last Gordon Ramsay \u201ccooking\u201d episode I decided to make another, this time I am cooking a souffle, following with a different Gordon Ramsay recipe video.\n\nI am going to continue to make live videos like this for a while, I will move away from cooking shortly of course because there is more to life than Gordon Ramsay videos. Perhaps carpentry next. I have wanted to take on a cooking video for a while, but I gotta stay fresh.\n\nAll my music and sound is from here: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/8pficg\n\nSupport the vidz at Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/upisnotjump \n\nI hope you all enjoy this new style of video, feel free yo leave in the comments things I can do other than cooking along with Gordon Ramsay and it\u2019s likely I will try it. The souffle honestly turned out pretty good, it didn\u2019t rise because unlike Gordon Ramsay, my ramekins were enormous. \nExcuse my terrible Cosplay as Gordon Ramsay, there aren\u2019t many wigs online that are similar to his hair so I just kinda freestyle it. \n\nI\u2019ll be taking a break from games until Half Life Alyx comes out. Ideally uintil then I will be making videos a bit more regularly, but we shall see ;)\n\nAnywho, enjoy Cooking With Gordon Ramsay Is An Absolute Nightmare, and This Is Why\n\nMy Twitter: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump \nMy Merch: https://www.pixelempire.com/collectio...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNN9K6IyujQ", "date_published": "2020-02-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
