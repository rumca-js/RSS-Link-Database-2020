It\u2019s not \u201cbeing distracted\u201d, but it\u2019s not <em>not</em> \u201cbeing distracted\u201d, either. We tend to think of distraction as an all-or-nothing affair: either you\u2019re concentrating successfully on something, or else you\u2019ve been distracted by Twitter or Netflix yet again.

The two usual theories are that people who do so aren\u2019t the sharpest tools in the shed (they believe the stories are true), or that they\u2019re cynical jerks focused on slandering the opposition (they don\u2019t care if they\u2019re not true). But the Canadian psychologist Gordon Pennycook and his colleagues found evidence that most people prone to sharing fake news <em>do</em> think it\u2019s important to share only true stories, and <em>are</em> capable of detecting fabricated ones. It\u2019s just that they get distracted \u2013 by, among other things, the urge to share the story they\u2019re reading \u2013 before they\u2019ve had a proper chance to reflect on its veracity.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/07/how-to-stop-spread-of-fake-news-oliver-burkeman\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/07/how-to-stop-spread-of-fake-news-oliver-burkeman", "date_published": "2020-02-07 15:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "My partner and I tried a threesome.

By Andrew Marantz</p><p>In 2012, a small group of young men, former supporters of the libertarian Republican congressman Ron Paul, started a blog called The Right Stuff. They soon began calling themselves \u201cpost-libertarians,\u201d although they weren\u2019t yet sure what would come next. By 2014, they\u2019d started to self-identify as \u201calt-right\u201d. They developed a countercultural tone \u2013 arch, antic, floridly offensive \u2013 that appealed to a growing cohort of disaffected young men, searching for meaning and addicted to the internet. These young men often referred to The Right Stuff, approvingly, as a key part of a \u201clibertarian-to-far-right pipeline\u201d, a path by which \u201cnormies\u201d could advance, through a series of epiphanies, toward \u201cfull radicalisation\u201d. As with everything the alt-right said, it was hard to tell whether they were joking, half-joking or not joking at all.</p><p>The Right Stuff \u2019s founders came up with talking points \u2013 narratives, they called them \u2013 that their followers then disseminated through various social networks. On Facebook, they posted Photoshopped images, or parody songs, or \u201ccountersignal memes\u201d \u2013 sardonic line drawings designed to spark just enough cognitive dissonance to shock normies out of their complacency. On Twitter, the alt-right trolled and harassed mainstream journalists, hoping to work the referees of the national discourse while capturing the attention of the wider public. On Reddit and 4chan and 8chan, where the content moderation was so lax as to be almost non-existent, the memes were more overtly vile. Many alt-right trolls started calling themselves \u201cfashy\u201d, or \u201cfash-ist\u201d. They referred to all liberals and traditional conservatives as communists, or \u201cdegenerates\u201d; they posted pro-Pinochet propaganda; they baited normies into arguments by insisting that \u201cHitler did nothing wrong\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/07/big-swinging-brains-fashy-trolls-clickbait-death-spiral-internet-media\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/feb/07/big-swinging-brains-fashy-trolls-clickbait-death-spiral-internet-media", "date_published": "2020-02-07 06:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Why Once Upon a Time in Hollywood should win the best picture Oscar", "description": "<p>Tarantino\u2019s cinematic ode to the movie industry is so relaxed it is barely a film at all and there are scenes that will stay with you for days</p><p>One of the highlights of the final furlong of awards season is the Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Brutally Honest Oscar Ballot series, in which Scott Feinberg talks outrageous truths out of an anonymous voter (whose identity Twitter then scurries to guess).</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/brutally-honest-oscar-ballot-irishman-was-boring-tarantino-amazing-1275576/item/best-director-2020-brutally-honest-ballot-1-1276073\">first one</a> this year was quite the corrective for all those who thought 1917 was a lock-in for best picture \u2013 unless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/03/why-parasite-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar\">Parasite</a> were to dazzlingly pip it.
