## Carlo Ancelotti insists finishing touches are not his style at Everton | Andy Hunter

<p>As Everton eye European qualification, manager counters argument that he cannot build winning teams from the bottom up</p><p>In Carlo Ancelotti’s eighth game as Everton manager he delivered something Marco Silva never achieved in 18 months – a comeback win in the Premier League. Victory in his ninth would continue the club’s managerial bounce, taking them joint sixth, a point behind Tottenham, and injecting a little more substance into the theory that another dismal season at Goodison Park could yet end in European qualification. “Nothing special,” was Ancelotti’s assessment of his work so far. “I am not a magician … until now.”</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/sabri-lamouchi-the-distance-nottingham-forest">Sabri Lamouchi aims to last the distance with improving Forest | Paul Doyle</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/07/carlo-ancelotti-everton-managerial-methods">Continue reading...</a>

## Frankie Boyle's Tour of Scotland review – och aye, it's the new travelogue king!

<p>There comes a time in every comedian’s career, says Boyle, when its time to sign up for a televised jolly. If only they were all as hilarious as this spiky, Billy Connolly-style adventure</p><p>It is so rare that I laugh – actually laugh out loud – at a programme that I cannot remember the last time. I smile plenty – sometimes wryly, sometimes balefully, sometimes properly – sigh in appreciative recognition of a beautifully crafted joke often, and mentally prostrate myself before a cast member or members’ flawless comic timing often enough that it remains a precious joy. But I belly-laughed throughout Frankie Boyle’s Tour of Scotland on BBC Two, and emerged much refreshed at the end of this half hour of him “reconnecting with Scotland, its people and its historical figures … [infinitesimally longer than necessary pause] and the many and varied ways in which English people killed them”.</p><p>Your mileage may vary of course. But as one of Boyle’s compatriots has it, for those who like this sort of thing, this is the sort of thing they like. I personally can take about as much of Boyle’s low-energy monotone undercut by unexpected swerves, and low-energy exterior belying a sly, witty mind working a mile a minute, as you care to throw at me. If you can’t, there will be plenty of standard travelogues along in the very near future, I’m sure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/07/frankie-boyles-tour-of-scotland-review-bbc2">Continue reading...</a>

Especially at a time like this, when the side of progress is beleaguered, when left or liberal values are taking a hammering on every front, apparently losing every battle, it’s natural to cling to whatever blanket of consolation we can find. When a single week can see Britain leave the European Union and Donald Trump bragging and swaggering in vengeful celebration as he escapes punishment for a high crime he clearly committed, the need for soothing can become intense. One such solace is that, despite the concrete defeats visible all around us, the left is somehow “winning the argument”.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/bbc-post-truth-dystopia-facts">Without the BBC we could be facing a post-truth dystopia | Jonathan Freedland</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/power-everything-progressives-boris-johnson-donald-trump">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s easy to get distracted by the urge to hit ‘share’. But most of us wouldn’t, if we gave it a moment’s thought</p><p>For a while now, I’ve been struggling to find words for a certain kind of mental state I keep experiencing, and of which I see signs in others. It’s not “being distracted”, but it’s not <em>not</em> “being distracted”, either. We tend to think of distraction as an all-or-nothing affair: either you’re concentrating successfully on something, or else you’ve been distracted by Twitter or Netflix yet again. But this is more like an erosion of attention, consistent with at least nominally remaining focused on the task at hand. (The label that comes closest is probably <a href="https://lindastone.net/qa/continuous-partial-attention/" title="">“continuous partial attention”</a>, coined by the writer Linda Stone.) One key symptom is what I can only describe as an impatience with one’s own cognitive processes – an unwillingness to think your thoughts all the way through to the end. And I’m beginning to wonder if this bears some blame for the various predicaments we’re in.</p><p>My hunch was reinforced by a new <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/3n9u8" title="">study</a>, which I discovered via <a href="https://digest.bps.org.uk/2020/01/16/most-people-who-share-fake-news-do-care-about-the-accuracy-of-news-items-theyre-just-distracted/" title="">Research Digest</a>, about why people share fake news online. The two usual theories are that people who do so aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed (they believe the stories are true), or that they’re cynical jerks focused on slandering the opposition (they don’t care if they’re not true). But the Canadian psychologist Gordon Pennycook and his colleagues found evidence that most people prone to sharing fake news <em>do</em> think it’s important to share only true stories, and <em>are</em> capable of detecting fabricated ones. It’s just that they get distracted – by, among other things, the urge to share the story they’re reading – before they’ve had a proper chance to reflect on its veracity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/07/how-to-stop-spread-of-fake-news-oliver-burkeman">Continue reading...</a>

## La Roux: Supervision review – obliquely beautiful, contrarian electro visionary

<p><strong>(Supercolour Records)</strong> <br />Her second release as a solo artist sees 1980s pop muted though Elly Jackson’s idiosyncratic and unique sound palette</p><p>When La Roux came to prominence in the late-00s with two shrill synthpop smashes – Bulletproof and In for the Kill – the duo were frequently discussed in terms of their nostalgia value. With their tinny, falsetto-driven, slightly wobbly electro – not to mention vocalist Elly Jackson’s gravity-defying quiff – it did seem a bit like the band were indulging in some 1980s new wave cosplay. Yet, funnily enough, those two tracks now feel headily redolent of the era they were made in. Not just thanks to their ubiquitous popularity, but because they chimed with the direction pop was taking at that time, being of a piece both with Lady Gaga’s dead-eyed, big-chorused anthems and the honking electro practised by indie acts such as MGMT and Empire of the Sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/07/la-roux-supervision-review">Continue reading...</a>

Around the world, millennials’ demand for the plants has created a wave of smuggling and theft<p>Swiping idly through Instagram stories at the weekend, I was horrified to see a crime being committed. My usual flurry of macha lattes and toddler boomerangs was interrupted by home CCTV footage of a man stealing my friend’s cactus.

This was clearly a targeted attack; the villain knew what he was aiming for.</p><p>It turns out he might have been part of a global crime wave. This week, two South Korean men <a href="https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2020-02-01-koreans-fined-r5m-as-poachers-target-sas-succulent-treasure-chest/" title="">in Cape Town were given heavy fines and suspended jail sentences</a> after being found guilty of trafficking 60,000 miniature succulents from South Africa and Namibia.

In any walk of life, the accused must be confronted – no matter how important they are. Parliament should lead by example<p>Wherever there is a scandal, there is so often a blind spot. The ability even of good people to look away, sometimes in pursuit of what seems to be the greater good, echoes through the findings of official inquiries down the ages. Complaints get ignored, tearful people swept under the carpet, because the accused is too difficult to confront or too important to lose. They might be guilty, they might not, but a slightly shamefaced consensus emerges – that now isn’t really the right time to ask.</p><p>And it doesn’t just happen in big institutions. It happens in ordinary offices, whenever the senior partner is considered more valuable to the firm than the secretaries who keep quitting in suspicious circumstances, so it’s easier just to get new secretaries than to ask questions. It happens in elite sport, when fans don’t want to hear what their heroes do off the pitch so long as they keep winning. And it looks worryingly as if something similar may have happened with the allegations now piling up against John Bercow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/07/john-bercow-bullying-allegations-westminster-accused-parliament">Continue reading...</a>

## Big Swinging Brains and fashy trolls: how the world fell into a clickbait death spiral

<p>In the years leading up to Trump’s election, traditional media gatekeepers found themselves shoved aside by trolls and tech companies who told us they were only giving us what we wanted. By Andrew Marantz</p><p>In 2012, a small group of young men, former supporters of the libertarian Republican congressman Ron Paul, started a blog called The Right Stuff. They soon began calling themselves “post-libertarians,” although they weren’t yet sure what would come next. By 2014, they’d started to self-identify as “alt-right”. They developed a countercultural tone – arch, antic, floridly offensive – that appealed to a growing cohort of disaffected young men, searching for meaning and addicted to the internet. These young men often referred to The Right Stuff, approvingly, as a key part of a “libertarian-to-far-right pipeline”, a path by which “normies” could advance, through a series of epiphanies, toward “full radicalisation”. As with everything the alt-right said, it was hard to tell whether they were joking, half-joking or not joking at all.</p><p>The Right Stuff ’s founders came up with talking points – narratives, they called them – that their followers then disseminated through various social networks. On Facebook, they posted Photoshopped images, or parody songs, or “countersignal memes” – sardonic line drawings designed to spark just enough cognitive dissonance to shock normies out of their complacency. On Twitter, the alt-right trolled and harassed mainstream journalists, hoping to work the referees of the national discourse while capturing the attention of the wider public. On Reddit and 4chan and 8chan, where the content moderation was so lax as to be almost non-existent, the memes were more overtly vile. Many alt-right trolls started calling themselves “fashy”, or “fash-ist”.

<p>Following a strikingly white and male list of Bafta nominees, this year’s Academy Awards shortlists are barely more diverse.

Plus: Joan E Greve on a hectic week of US politics</p><p>When the lists of nominees for the major film awards in 2020 were announced, there was, once again, a glaring anomaly. Not a single person of colour was nominated in the Bafta acting categories, while the Oscars managed only Cynthia Erivo for her part in Harriet. </p><p>It is an issue that the industry is well aware of: in 2015, the ceremony saw #OscarsSoWhite trending on Twitter, while actors such as Eddie Murphy were rebuking the academy from the stage back in the 1990s. So what explains the glacial pace of change?
