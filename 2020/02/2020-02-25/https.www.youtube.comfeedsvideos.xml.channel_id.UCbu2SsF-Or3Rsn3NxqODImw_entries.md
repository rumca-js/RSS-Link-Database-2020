Join us as we embark on our journey into the opening minutes of Ori and the Will of the Wisps.

Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the follow-up to the 2015 narrative-focused Metroidvania starring a forest spirit exploring a dangerous, yet beautiful world. Ori and the Blind Forest possessed an emotional story where the titular character would eventually find the strength within to overcome their dangerous foes and reunite with its closest allies. Blending fast-paced combat and travel mechanics, it made for an exciting and visually stunning journey to dive into, which culminated in a satisfying conclusion that pulled on the heartstrings. 

With the sequel approaching its March 11 release on Xbox One and PC, we had the chance to get some hands-on time with the game. In this gameplay video, we show off the opening of Will of the Wisps, which sets up what's to come in Ori's next adventure. After being separated from their family, and finding them lost in a new world outside of Nibel Forest, Ori must reacquire their skills and take on new abilities to face off against the foreign land's dangers. Along the way, Ori will connect with the Wellspring's many inhabitants, who will come to be Ori's closest allies in the adventure.

There was a lot to take in from the opening hours of Ori and the Will of the Wisps. If you're interested in learning more about what we played from the opening hours of the game, check out GameSpot's written impressions detailing what's to come with the sequel.

Raccoon City has never looked more terrifying! Check out our side-by-side comparison of the original 1999 title vs the 2020 remake.

Capcom is drastically reimagining Resident Evil 3 with its upcoming remake of the two-decade-old PS1 original. Early footage gave us brief glimpses of Jill, Raccoon City, and Nemesis. Recently, we got a new in-depth look at the remake's version of several iconic scenes, characters, and enemies from the original. 

In the video above, we compare both the original and remake, giving you a side-by-side look at the differences between the two. You can see in greater detail how RE3 remake interprets enemies like Nemesis, Hunter Gamma, Drain Deimos, as well as locations like the substation and Raccoon City itself. There's a lot more, too, so definitely watch it the whole way through. 

You can expect to play RE3 remake on PS4, PC, and Xbox One on April 3. If you're interested in our impressions about how the game is shaping up so far, check out our video discussing our experiences playing the game for two hours.

We break down everything we saw during a two-hour demo of Resident Evil 3 Remake, the upcoming reimagining of the survival-horror classic.

Resident Evil 3 remake is fast approaching, but there’s still a lot unknown about the reimagining of the the over two-decade-old classic. GameSpot editor Matt Espineli got two hours of hands-on time with the game at a preview event, and you can see his impressions in the video above.

So far, the game's shaping up to be a terrifying return to Racoon City. Matt details how the game has evolved and changed this time around, from the more open environments to the increase in the action. And of course, he encountered Nemesis, who he feels is even more terrifying this time around.

Resident Evil 3 remake releases on PS4, PC, and Xbox One on April 3. If you’re interested in how the remake compares to the original game, check out our gameplay comparison video or Matt Espinelli's in-depth article at GameSpot.com!
