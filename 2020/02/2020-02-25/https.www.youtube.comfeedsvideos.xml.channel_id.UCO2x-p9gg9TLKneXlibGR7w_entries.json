The Mac Pro is great and all, but its $6,000 starting price point and \"one-size-fits-all-pros\" approach means its financially out of reach for many of us mere mortals. But rather than turn to hackintosh land, why couldn't Apple just make a smaller ATX or mini-ITX sized Mac Pro mini\u2014one with the same upgradable RAM, CPU, GPU, and more for less money and in a smaller case? Snazzy Labs takes a look at the new NZXT H1 mini-ITX SFF case. With a built-in AIO, SFF PSU, and PCIe riser card for the GPU, this case is ready to rumble from the factory. Just insert your mini ITX motherboard, attach the cooler, plug-in the pre-wired cables and insert your GPU. That's it. You're done. The whole build takes less than 10 minutes. Pretty freaking awesome for what are historically nightmarish cases to build in.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnhiySD5x1Q", "date_published": "2020-02-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
