But within an hour, it\u2019s standing, walking, and nursing on its own. And a blue whale calf, after nearly a year growing inside mom, can swim to the surface moments after being born. Human babies on the other hand? We\u2019re born unable to move or eat on our own, we can\u2019t communicate or fully sense our world, and we leak EVERYWHERE. If humans are so smart, why are our babies so\u2026 un-smart? You may think it\u2019s all about head size, but the real science is more complex.\n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/why-babies-helpless-references/home \n\nNote: In videos like this one, we use the terms male and female to refer to biological sex and typical secondary characteristics seen across the human population.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\nAlecZero\nBob Rosset\nBrent M.\nDiego Lombeida\nRon Kakar\nvincbis\n\n-----------\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM-sBZBiuD4", "date_published": "2020-02-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
