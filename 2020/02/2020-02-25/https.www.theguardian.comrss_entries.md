Davidsen is simultaneously one of the company’s biggest draws this season and a relatively new face on the international stage. It may be that the casting of Jonas Kaufmann as Florestan ensured the ROH’s new production of Fidelio, staged by Tobias Kratzer, sold out within 24 hours, but for many it’s the prospect of Davidsen as Leonore – Beethoven’s courageous, cross-dressing, husband-rescuing heroine – that’s generating the real excitement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/25/lise-davidsen-soprano-fidelio-royal-opera-house-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many experts believe this outbreak will soon be declared a pandemic. Even if it is not containable, it can still be slowed</p><p>It now appears almost inevitable that the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak" title="">coronavirus</a> outbreak will soon be identified as a global <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/what-does-it-mean-if-coronavirus-is-declared-a-pandemic" title="">pandemic</a>. There has been a surge in cases in Iran, South Korea and Italy, and incidents confirmed in numerous countries, in addition to the almost 80,000 cases seen in China. The World Health Organization argues that it is not a pandemic – spreading internationally in an uncontrolled way – because it is cautiously optimistic that China’s outbreak may have peaked thanks to the strict measures adopted by Beijing. Others say this is already a pandemic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic-in-all-but-name-says-expert" title="">in all but name</a>.</p><p>The WHO’s hesitance may be partly due to its concern about the public reaction, as rational worries combine with limited medical knowledge, xenophobia and broader anxieties. “Using the word pandemic now does not fit the facts, but it may certainly cause fear,” the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, warned on Monday. As concern spreads, economic effects are growing alongside the human toll. Stock markets have taken a hammering. Airlines are suffering, major international events are being cancelled, and companies dependent on Chinese-made components have halted production.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-new-coronavirus-buying-time-can-save-lives">Continue reading...</a>

Some call the contest boring, but the despair felt by members since 12 December inhibits any sense of enthusiasm<p>Some say the Labour leadership election is boring, but boredom is in the eye of the beholder. So far, from the outside, it has not ignited; it lacks passion, the candidates differ only in presentation. Even from the inside, among party members, a common enough sentiment is, let this contest end and someone win. There is a sense that the candidates are not doing enough either to differentiate themselves or to upturn expectations. It is not the candidates themselves who lack verve, but their supporters. Every candidate has their fans, but they are shy, which is the opposite of what fandom is supposed to be about.</p><p>The twist of the 2016 US election was the revelation that supporters didn’t matter as much as “stans” – wild enthusiasts, evangelists, people who would wear a candidate’s face as a tattoo. It’s the Joan of Arc view of politics: we don’t even need 100 people so strong, just 10 could do it, with God on their side (God, here, standing in for the might of conviction). Without cheerleaders, the casually interested don’t know where to put themselves. All the Labour candidates have these stans, but there is an overarching pall over expressing enthusiasm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/labour-leadership-election-starmer-nandy-long-bailey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Designer uses sophisticated optics to pitch the brand as conscious and engaged</p><p>Because Christian Dior loved flowers and nature, he took the tulip as inspiration for his dress patterns and bottled the scent of lily of the valley as Diorissimo. But in the 21st century, the house he founded broadcasts its affections on a grander scale.</p><p>Dior have partnered with the Louvre museum to finance a five-year restoration project of the Tuileries Gardens. Financial details of the patronage have not been disclosed, but when Paris fashion week opens with the Dior name emblazoned on a temporary structure the size of a provincial railway station in the centre of one of the oldest and most elegant public parks in Paris it seems fair to assume a hefty sum is involved.<br /><br />Fashion is now much bigger than mere clothes and Christian Dior, one of the most powerful brands of the moment, has both the ambition and the economic might to claim a seat at the table in conversations ranging from feminism to climate change. Along with stablemate Louis Vuitton, Dior was given credit by the luxury powerhouse LVMH for last year’s “exceptional growth”, which saw group revenue increase 16% to €38.4bn in the first nine moments of 2019.<br /><br />Cheekbones and champagne are no longer sufficient to dazzle catwalk audiences.

If not, then here is the premise: 30 men and women date each other, in rotation, from isolated “pods” where – sight unseen – they pair off, which is obviously to say, they get engaged. Only then do they see each other for the first time – one month before their wedding day.</p><p>Then, they must zip through relationship milestones – first holiday together, cohabitation, meeting the parents – before they decide, at the altar, whether or not to say: “I do.” The weddings episode, the finale, will be available on Netflix from Thursday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/25/love-is-blind-netflixs-hit-is-dating-tv-at-its-most-awful-and-compelling">Continue reading...</a>

And there’s no sign of the trend deflating</p><p>Oversized sleeves shouldn’t be a viable trend. They come stuffed with social and logistical questions. Such as: is it possible to hug those you love while wearing a top that resembles giant arm bands? And: how can you possibly squeeze a pair of huge sleeves into the arms of your coat? (Answers: no; and you can’t.) And yet the big sleevification of fashion is in full swing regardless.</p><p>Last week’s Milan catwalks were full of sleeves the diameter of dinner plates. Elongated puffs of fabric covered the arms, like the trunk of a squid, at Fendi. At MaxMara, dresses came with drop-shouldered puff sleeves and bomber jackets with multilayered frills that recalled sea anemones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/25/pump-up-the-volume-why-massive-sleeves-are-this-years-biggest-trend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cash-strapped churches are raising money by inviting developers to build pricey flats on their turf. Is this the promised land for faith buildings – or a deal with the devil?</p><p>High-end Bosch appliances, carpeted bedrooms, generous storage – and a three-storey wooden cross right outside the window. The apartments of <a href="http://upperplace.london/">Upper Place</a> sound like any other new development in east London, sold on their edgy urban location and proximity to artisanal coffee shops, except these particular flats come with the added promise of bringing you closer to God. Other blocks might boast a private gym, but here you can pop downstairs to see the priest for a workout of a more spiritual kind.</p><p>Sandwiched between a Tesco Express and a used-furniture shop, this new holy housing project is a surprising thing to encounter on a high street in Hackney. The supersized wooden cross is bolted to a gigantic white concrete frame, projecting out in front of rows of balconies adorned with balustrades tinted in a range of bright Tooty Frootie colours, as if a nod to a stained-glass window. A big TV screen at the entrance advertises the lively services of the <a href="http://capital-architecture.co.uk/projects/united-reformed-church-upper-clapton/">Upper Clapton United Reformed Church</a> that await within, conducted by the charismatic white-suited Rev John Macaulay in a large ground-floor space, illuminated from above by a cross-shaped skylight.

<p>A vaudeville thriller set around a Dublin newspaper in 1973 uses knockabout humour to parallel modern-day geopolitics</p><p>‘General swearing and delight” is playwright Michael West’s winning stage direction for a smoky, boozy day at an Irish newspaper office. In his new political comedy, The Fall of the Second Republic, early 1970s Dublin is conjured with an affectionately satirical touch.</p><p>West’s script for this co-production between Irish theatre group the <a href="http://www.cornexchange.ie/">Corn Exchange</a> and the Abbey theatre is anchored in a few facts about 1973, a year in which a general election and a presidential election were held in Ireland. From there, it spins into a manically inventive counterfactual caper; absurd but with recognisable flashes of reality and bite, especially about political cynicism towards the arts and culture. Portraying business-as-usual centrist politics suddenly lurching towards a violent coup d’état and martial law, West and director Annie Ryan clearly have the present rise in unpredictable geopolitics in mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/25/the-fall-of-the-second-republic-michael-west-annie-ryan-abbey-theatre">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Guildhall School of Music and Drama, London </strong><br />Although well sung and staged, Lliam Paterson’s score and Pamela Carter’s text fail to make a substantial opera out of this Don DeLillo short story</p><p><a href="http://www.lliampaterson.co.uk/">Lliam Paterson’s</a> The Angel Esmeralda was commissioned by Scottish Opera while he was its young composer in residence. But why it’s now receiving its world premiere at the Guildhall School in London rather than north of the border seems a less important question than what made Paterson and his librettist, Pamela Carter, think <a href="https://classic.esquire.com/article/1994/5/1/the-angel-esmeralda">this 1994 short story</a> by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/dondelillo">Don DeLillo</a> could be the starting point for a viable piece of music theatre.</p><p>Set in New York’s South Bronx in the 1970s, it’s a slender fable focusing on two nuns in the deprived, lawless community there. Sister Edgar is old-school and committed to a life of contemplation, while Sister Grace is desperate to do what she can to alleviate the social problems around them. They hear of a miracle on the expressway: the face of Esmeralda, a teenage girl who was raped and murdered, has been seen in an orange juice advert. Edgar sees the face for herself, but when news of the miracle spreads, the advert is removed. Nothing has changed and Edgar returns to prayer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/25/angel-esmeralda-review-don-delillo-lliam-paterson-guildhall">Continue reading...</a>

Historians of the future, who are rational adults, will not understand why we behave in the ridiculous ways that we do.

<p>Confidence in democracy has been taking a hammering, so how refreshing to see a politician with big ideas win hearts and minds<strong><br /></strong></p><p>Democracy did not die in 2003, but a lot of people’s faith in it did. Just over 17 years ago, I was one of the millions of people around the world who marched against the Iraq war. The energy on the streets in London was electrifying; it was the biggest protest in British history. The government, I naively thought at the time, would have to listen. The government, of course, did not listen. A few weeks later, Iraq was illegally invaded. This great betrayal galvanised a few of my friends into activism. But it left me, and many others, disillusioned at best and apathetic at worst. My student idealism withered and I lost confidence in the democratic process.</p><p>In the past few days, however, something strange has started to happen: I have begun to feel hopeful about politics again. In the US, the growing success of Bernie Sanders’ grassroots movement in the Democractic presidential nominations has restored my faith in people power. It has made me dare to hope that a second Donald Trump term may not be as inevitable as I previously thought it was. It made me dare to hope that a more equitable America – and, by extension, a more equitable world – really might be around the corner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/25/bernie-sanders-cant-be-bought-strangely-hopeful">Continue reading...</a>

Lucian Freud’s etchings bore me senseless, Francis Bacon barely doodled, but Hockney is a graphic master. His retrospective of a life of portrait drawing is the most dazzling display of his art I have ever seen.</p><p>Forget <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/may/15/art.smoking">the rants about smoking</a>, or the personality that has always made him so lovable. Hockney here is not a star but a stare. In self-portraits drawn with a steady black line, he eyeballs himself in the mirror, mercilessly seeing lank hair and a skinny body. He draws his own eyes through the unforgiving lenses of his spectacles. It’s uncomfortable to stand close to those eyes – the sense of Hockney sizing you up is almost oppressive. This series was made in 1983, when he was still blond, but he can see himself getting older. What does the future hold? The intensity of Hockney’s self-inspection, fag in mouth, bears comparison with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/01/rembrandt-light-game-of-thrones-dulwich-picture-gallery">Rembrandt</a>.

Whose Line Is It Anyway? made her a household name. But, more than 30 years on, does the queen of improv also think it held her back? She talks about ambition, sexism and her lucky escape from the trolls<p>Josie Lawrence is supposed to be talking about her new play, Our Lady of Blundellsands, by Jonathan Harvey, who is probably best known for Gimme, Gimme, Gimme. But she gets there by way of a thousand detours, from her first gig in a working men’s club, which she took in order to get an Equity card, through the late 80s, her reign as queen of improv, to Oklahoma!, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/24/oklahoma-review-chichester-festival-theatre-josie-lawrence-rodgers-and-hammerstein" title="">she did recently in Chichester</a>. “It was an uber-talented company – young people who could do everything: dancing, singing, acting. It was joyous. I was Mama Josie and they treated me just lovely. I did everything with them. Bowling, parties, days at the beach, karaoke.”</p><p>There’s something in this litany of wholesome pursuits that distils the way she talks about her career: an ongoing sense of wonder at how great everyone is, as though she has just fallen fresh on to a stage from space. It’s extremely contagious – after 20 minutes in her company you find yourself thinking the best of the world and eagerly looking forward to Blundellsands, which sounds surreal and perceptive, domestic and tragic, Sunset Boulevard retold by way of Coronation Street. But “delighted ingenue” is an unusual figure on the comedy circuit, which tends to demand something a bit more savage. Lawrence – who prefers “performer” to “comic” – has always been unusual.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/25/josie-lawrence-of-course-i-dont-think-im-sexy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lower prices, government initiatives and growing environmental awareness mean hybrid cars are on their way to becoming the new normal, writes Sandrine Ceurstemont</p><p>Hybrid cars were one of the big success stories of 2019. Whereas overall car sales were down by 2.7% in the UK, hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) sales increased by 17.1% compared with the previous year, according to <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations/" rel="nofollow">figures released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders</a>. “It’s really impressive,” says Jamie Hamilton, a director at Deloitte UK who focuses on the automotive sector.</p><p>The trend should continue this year. Growing environmental concerns, plus the UK government plan to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars, including hybrids, by 2035, mean people are now thinking twice about how they get around. Hybrids aren’t quite as green as fully electric vehicles (EVs) since they use a combination of petrol and electric power, but they are often the go-to choice for those who aren’t ready to make the leap to EVs, for a variety of reasons. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thehybridhero/2020/feb/25/will-2020-be-the-year-of-the-hybrid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fast-evolving technology and rising consumer demand means electric vehicles could overtake petrol-powered cars sooner than you think – with hybrids a practical stepping stone along the way</p><p>These are unsettling times for the UK car market. Figures released every month by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) chart a steady decline in registrations as both consumer and business confidence declines and new car sales follow suit. Look a little closer at the figures and a different picture emerges, however – the registration of low- and zero-emission vehicles is on a steady upswing. The numbers are better than good: hybrid-electric vehicle (HEV) and battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales are booming.</p><p>November’s year-to-date figures show overall car registrations <a href="https://www.smmt.co.uk/vehicle-data/car-registrations/" rel="nofollow">down 2.7%</a> from the same period in 2018 (itself a five-year low). Against that backdrop, HEV sales have risen 16%, and BEVs by 136%. A low base makes these numbers possible, but the trend is unmistakable: for the month of November itself, more than one in 10 cars registered in the UK was either an HEV, plug-in hybrid (PHEV) or BEV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/thehybridhero/2020/feb/25/the-promising-growth-of-low-and-zero-emission-vehicles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s no communication, neither of us climax and I’m becoming more and more hesitant about initiating intimacy</p><p><strong>My boyfriend and I have been intimate for several months, but the sex is consistently mediocre. Neither of us climax, and often I’m not sure whether I’m giving him pleasure. Our communication about sex is essentially nil; it’s just assumed that it will happen when we’re in bed together. I have attempted to open up conversations a couple of times</strong><strong>, but he has never taken the bait. This lack of communication is making me hesitant to initiate intimacy, because I worry about how we’ll decide when to stop, or that we’ll continue</strong><strong> through something</strong><strong> neither of us are enjoying</strong><strong>. How can I change this and encourage communication without making him feel self-conscious?</strong></p><p>You know exactly what is wrong, but perhaps you need help forming the words to improve your communication. To avoid sounding critical, always start with a positive affirmation. For example: “I really enjoy being with you, I was just wondering if you could help me to understand exactly how you like it?” Or: “I love being intimate with you, but next time please give me some instructions.

<p>I was struggling with my mental health when I started wandering daily on the marshes. The experience opened my eyes to the extraordinary healing power of the natural world</p><p>During a period of ill health a few years back, as I struggled with depression and addiction, three of the four elements that helped me to recover were straightforward: psychiatry; psychotherapy; and the support of others. The fourth was more mysterious, and I set out on a journey to try to understand it.</p><p>In my teenage years, I had developed an aptitude for drinking, as many adolescents do. But it was while working as a music journalist in my 20s that my addictions accelerated. By April 2012, at the age of 27, I was on my knees. I knew that the drink and drugs had to go: the highs were getting harder to achieve; the lows were becoming more dangerous, more self-destructive. I knew my mental and physical health were deteriorating, but I couldn’t seem to stop or cut down. After months of trying to do this alone, I found a rehabilitation programme and set out on a path to sobriety.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/25/ecological-grief-i-mourn-the-loss-of-nature-it-saved-me-from-addiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For decades, the way we farm has been degrading land and destroying wildlife. Now there’s a revolution coming – but is it going to create more problems than it solves? By Christopher de Bellaigue</p><p>In the last years of the 20th century, Glenfeshie, a 17,000-hectare estate in the Scottish Highlands, was in steep decline. Decades of overgrazing by deer had reduced its hillsides to clipped lifelessness. Denied the protection afforded by tree roots, the banks of the River Feshie were losing soil each time it flooded, the water depositing silt downstream. Those few Scots pines that had survived the browsing of the deer were nearing the end of their lives; soon there would be no seed source for the next generation.</p><p>Between 1997 and 2006, ownership of Glenfeshie passed between three Danish businessmen – and with it a self-destructive business model. Only by maintaining very high numbers of livestock could the flow of fee-paying deerstalkers armed with rifles be ensured, but because of the rising cost of gamekeepers and estate upkeep, Glenfeshie’s sporting operations were still making a loss. All the while, the pine martens, mountain hares and hen harriers for which the Highlands are a natural habitat were being crowded out by the deer on which the model depended.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/the-end-of-farming-rewilding-intensive-agriculture-food-safety">Continue reading...</a>
