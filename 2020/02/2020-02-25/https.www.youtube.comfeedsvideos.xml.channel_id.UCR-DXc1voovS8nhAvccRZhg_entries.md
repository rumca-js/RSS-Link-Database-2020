In this fourth livestream, we tried to set up GitHub Actions for Drupal CI... then encountered a GitHub outage! So we switched tracks to running the migration again, and found that we had to install some extra modules like Taxonomy and Comment to get past those error messages. Then we tried updating the migration configuration and found that migrate-upgrade kept duplicating migrations (so we had upgrade_upgrade_upgrade_d7_thing.yml files), so we finished the episode by cleaning up the migrations a little, reinstalling the site, then running the migrations again.
