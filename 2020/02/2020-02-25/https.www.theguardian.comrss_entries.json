She talks about family, friends and facing her fears</p><p>I\u2019m pretty sure the man who\u2019s very politely shunting Lise Davidsen out of our Royal Opera House interview room to make way for an audit meeting doesn\u2019t recognise her, but perhaps that\u2019s not so surprising. Davidsen is simultaneously one of the company\u2019s biggest draws this season and a relatively new face on the international stage. It may be that the casting of Jonas Kaufmann as Florestan ensured the ROH\u2019s new production of Fidelio, staged by Tobias Kratzer, sold out within 24 hours, but for many it\u2019s the prospect of Davidsen as Leonore \u2013 Beethoven\u2019s courageous, cross-dressing, husband-rescuing heroine \u2013 that\u2019s generating the real excitement.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/25/lise-davidsen-soprano-fidelio-royal-opera-house-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/25/lise-davidsen-soprano-fidelio-royal-opera-house-london", "date_published": "2020-02-25 19:18:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus outbreak puts Aston Martin's prospects in the slow lane", "description": "<p>Canadian billionaire\u2019s rescue plan suddenly doesn\u2019t look so rosy given the epidemic\u2019s economic fallout</p><p>At what point does the coronavirus crisis qualify as a \u201cmaterial adverse change\u201d for City deal-making purposes? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/31/lawrence-stroll-f1-boss-fashion-tycoon-rescuing-aston-martin\">Lawrence Stroll</a>, would-be rescuer of Aston Martin, may be asking the question right now.
