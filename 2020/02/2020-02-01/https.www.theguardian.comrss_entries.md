<p>After a shocking week for the broadcaster, what are the issues it must tackle to keep its place in the nation’s cultural landscape?</p><p>In his eye-catching pitch for his new job as chair of the powerful parliamentary group that monitors the BBC, Julian Knight, MP for Solihull, promised, among other things, to run the culture, media and sport select committee, as an “unofficial ‘Royal Commission’ on the future of the corporation”.</p><p>Last Thursday, a victorious Knight swiftly underlined his plan to “ask difficult questions about the BBC’s future funding model”. He also applauded a suggestion from fellow MP James Cartlidge that a more commercial BBC could become “a top export service”.

<p>The dominant style of football’s hyper-capitalistic age has its origins in the unlikeliest of places</p><p>A training field near Ostfildern, in the forest south-east of Stuttgart. It’s February 1983, and local sixth-tier side Viktoria Backnang are playing a friendly against Valeriy Lobanovskyi’s Dynamo Kyiv, who are wintering at Sportschule Ruit. For Viktoria’s young player-manager, Ralf Rangnick, it is a revelatory experience. When the ball goes out of play for a throw-in early on, Rangnick counts the Dynamo players, half-believing they had sneaked an extra man on to the pitch. They hadn’t, but such was the ferocity of their pressing that it felt as if they had. And so a seed was planted that has had a profound impact on football’s tactical development.</p><p>Dynamo kept coming to Ruit and Rangnick, who is now the head of sport and development at Red Bull, kept studying them. As his career developed he became part of a group of coaches fascinated by the possibilities of zonal marking and pressing, radical ideas in a Germany dominated by the belief that football was about individual battles, courage and vocal leadership.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/01/pioneering-reds-the-reds-jurgen-klopp-liverpool-pressing-unlikely-origin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Continuing a new series, our writer considers just what makes the Senate’s majority leader so amazing</p><p>I have to confess to an unhealthy obsession with Mitch McConnell, the majority leader of the United States Senate. It is not just that he has the strangely amazed look of a southern gentleman who has just caught his wife in flagrante with the stable hand. It is also that he has a very clear idea of what he wants to do and will stop at nothing to do it. His aim is to serve the interests of the Republican party in the Senate. Everything else – the interests of the US, the constitution, truth, justice, even Republicans not in the Senate – is subservient.</p><p>There is something about the US separation of powers that makes congressional politicians highly distilled examples of their profession. McConnell is a distillation of this distillation. He is horribly good at what he does. Whenever I read how, this time, he has misplayed his hand, I wait for events to prove that he has. So far, they haven’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/01/mitch-mcconnell-transgender-action-reaction-authenticity-dickens">Continue reading...</a>

Uttar Pradesh’s leading protesters against new citizenship law believe they were rounded up to quell further dissent<br /><p>At 73 years old, Mohammad Shoaib had grown used to harassment from police. As one of India’s highest-profile activists, he had made a name fighting for Muslims falsely accused of being terrorists by the police, earning him powerful enemies.</p><p>But in late December, as he was brought into the police station in Lucknow, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, in the middle of the night, he felt something had shifted. “Police officers abused me badly while I was in their custody and they threatened me in many ways,” he said. “One [senior officer] said to me at the police station: ‘I will fuck your mother. I am going to throw all your family members in jail where they will rot for life. I will destroy your family’.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/uttar-pradesh-india-activists-false-arrest-torture-custody-citizenship-amendment-act">Continue reading...</a>

## Is housing design and planning safe in the Tories’ hands?

<p>Inspired by the late philosopher Roger Scruton, the government talks about beauty, but promotes ugly development. If they’re serious about good design, they need a theory that’s not skin-deep</p><p>The Conservative government likes beauty. It has said as much, through the mouths of ministers, so it must be true. “This government,” the housing secretary, Robert Jenrick, recently told the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, “will make sure that beautiful, well-designed homes and places are the expectation, not the exception.” It has created the Building Better, Building Beautiful commission in order to help “increase the use of high-quality design for new build homes and neighbourhoods”. Last week it produced a report, <em>Living in Beauty</em>, that argues that beauty should be legally enshrined in the planning system.</p><p>But what’s this? Barely two weeks ago the same Robert Jenrick gave<em> </em>planning permission to a £1bn development called Westferry Printworks in London Docklands, against the strong objections of his own planning inspector. The latter, David Prentis, said the project’s five towers, the tallest of them 44 storeys high, would “fail to preserve” the setting of Tower Bridge and of the Unesco world heritage site in Greenwich. The development would be “harmful to the character and appearance of the area”. Its inclusion of 282 affordable homes in a total of 1,524 units was deemed not to achieve the “maximum reasonable amount”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/01/westferry-printworks-london-docklands-robert-jenrick-tory-housing-policy-roger-scruton-living-beauty">Continue reading...</a>

Ireland in Dublin next Saturday are far more likely to demand an answer but the home side achieved a first under their new head coach, not conceding a point for the first time in the Six Nations, as well as banking a bonus.</p><p>However one difference was evident from the kick-off and was highlighted when Nick Tompkins came off the bench to make his Test debut. Wales had possession for two minutes and did not resort to the boot once. Leigh Halfpenny passed when fielding a kick in his own half and the recipient, Dan Biggar, who last year would have sent the ball high into the air and set off in determined pursuit, set off and passed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/01/wales-italy-six-nations-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Cooking Vinyl)<br />Lee pursues his twin passions on this fine third album, produced by Bernard Butler, with a star turn by Elizabeth Fraser</p><p>Ever since childhood singalongs around the fires of Forest School Camps, folksong and mother nature have been indivisible passions for <a href="https://samleesong.co.uk/" title="">Sam Lee</a>. The singer’s third album, the first with Suede’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bernard-butler" title="">Bernard Butler</a> producing, fuses the two obsessions in dazzling fashion. Once again the songs are all traditional, while Lee has skilfully intercut some and “rewilded” them with the odd flourish – the “Old Wow” of the title is his name for an awestruck sense of nature.</p><p>The album frequently sounds far from traditional, however. Lee’s rich baritone voice carries the imprint of folk past – no one does “unaccompanied” better – but he can also slide into 1950s crooner (he has been known to sport a tux). Butler knows when to leave well alone, but adds jazzy shadings for The Garden of England and Sweet Sixteen, a touch of rock muscle for Lay This Body Down, and swelling strings for Soul Cake. There’s also a spine-tingling duet with the Cocteau Twins’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/24/elizabeth-fraser-meltdown-cocteau-twins" title="">Elizabeth Fraser</a> on Wild Mountain Thyme.

<p>Though Steve Jobs’s sleek tablet was a worldwide hit, it can still be naggingly awkward to use</p><p>Last Monday, the Apple iPad turned 10. On 27 January 2010, Steve Jobs walked on to the stage of a San Francisco auditorium carrying with him the answer to years of fevered speculation. “Everyone at the event that day knew why they were there,” <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/the-ipad-at-10-a-new-product-category-defined-by-apps/" title="">wrote John Vorhees</a>, “and what would be announced”. Jobs acknowledged as much up front, saying that he had a “truly magical and revolutionary product” to unveil. “Last time there was this much excitement about a tablet,” observed the normally sober <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, “it had some commandments written on it.”</p><p>This was three years on from the launch of the iPhone, the device that really transformed Apple into a tech giant, so everyone thought they knew roughly what the new device would look like – a bigger block of aluminium and glass with a touch-sensitive screen.

After all, Microsoft had been experimenting with tablets for years: a tablet, to them, was a portable slab which had a keyboard and a stylus. The tech media, for their part, also “knew” two things: the new device would be Apple’s answer to the cheap netbooks that were then the sensation du jour and, knowing Apple, it wouldn’t be cheap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/01/ten-years-on-apple-ipad-naggingly-awkward-to-use">Continue reading...</a>

Our writer explains why its creator needn’t give a feck<p>Brendan O’Carroll had barely reached the stage to collect a National Television award for <em>Mrs Brown’s Boys</em> when critics were declaring the end of civilisation. “The final nail in the coffin of democracy.” “Everything that is wrong with our country.” “A metaphor of Britain’s decision-making right now.” “That’s the Great British public for you. Brexit. Boris. <em>Mrs Brown’s Boys</em>.”</p><p>Tweeters seethed with scorn and disbelief. How could such a dire sitcom, an affront to good taste, human intellect and cultural evolution, prevail over <em>Fleabag</em>, <em>Derry Girls</em> and <em>After Life</em>? How could this antediluvian freak be voted best comedy and steal glory from shows that were funny, clever and groundbreaking?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/01/how-mrs-brown-boys-got-last-laugh-bredan-o-carroll-national-tv-awards">Continue reading...</a>

## Madonna review – chutzpah, spy chic and revolutionary zeal

<p><strong>London Palladium</strong><br />A heady riot of bangers and spectacular dance moves, the first night of Madonna’s West End residency is worth the hefty ticket price</p><p>White port and willpower make for quite a cocktail. About halfway through tonight’s two-hour set, the first of 14 in London, Madonna takes a break on top of a baby grand piano. She drains a glass of the Douro region’s finest export – “sipping my pain just like champagne”, perhaps, as per the lyrics of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAxNaLAR2to" title="">Medellin</a>, a song from her last album, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jun/08/madonna-madame-x-review-splendidly-bizarre-return-to-form" title="">Madame X</a>.</p><p>Madonna grew fond of white port when she first moved to Lisbon, where her footballing son, David, enrolled in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/31/madonna-moves-to-lisbon-as-son-joins-football-youth-academy" title="">Benfica’s youth academy</a> three years ago, and tonight it combines very well with Madonna’s steely self-possession. Forget the overplayed G&amp;T boom – a little fortified wine allows the embattled singer to deliver a knockout show, full of stagecraft and chutzpah, spy chic and revolutionary zeal, in spite of well-publicised limitations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/01/madonna-review-london-palladium-madame-x-tour">Continue reading...</a>

I often still marvel at myself, changing the gears with one hand. I feel very empowered and really very, very pleased with myself.</p><p><strong>When I was two,</strong> my mother’s chip pan caught fire – and that’s how religion started for me. She’d taken down a plate from the wall that had a prayer on it; I linked the fire to us interfering with God’s word. Today, I despise organised religion – they’re all misogynistic, they’re all about keeping people terrified, controlling women. Catholicism is obsessed with people’s sex lives.

## 'It was like a movie': the high school students who uncovered a toxic waste scandal

<p>In the 90s, an inspirational teacher and his students uncovered corruption and illegal dumping in their backyard. Nearly 30 years on, is Middletown still at risk?</p><p>In the summer of 1991, Middletown high school, roughly 70 miles north of Manhattan in New York’s verdant Orange County, acquired a handful of video cameras. The goal was to train the school’s teenage students in film-making and media production, using local subjects as a starting point – perhaps a documentary about the city’s sports teams or an amateur talkshow. Instead, under the tutelage of Middletown high’s popular English teacher, Fred Isseks, a rowdy and diverse group of teenagers organised themselves into an investigative journalism unit.</p><p>Officially, Isseks’ class was open only to the school’s oldest students, aged 16 to 18 – but, unofficially, it welcomed everyone. Kids not even enrolled in the course joined Isseks’ students in shooting short films. The teenagers alternated between grungy early-90s flannel and choker necklaces and awkward attempts at business attire as they honed their reporting skills. They invited local representatives into the school’s new media studio for a political debate, and covered topics such as the city’s curfew for teens. One former student joked to me that the class became a surreal mix of “rap videos and corrupt politicians”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/01/like-movie-students-uncovered-toxic-waste-scandal">Continue reading...</a>

## The kimono – from costume to catwalk

<p>From the 17th to the 20th century the kimono was the principal piece of clothing in Japan for both men and women. But now it’s an inspiration for fashion all over the world<br /></p><p>Fashion as we know it – the business of clothes-as-zeitgeist, as distinct from simple dressmaking – was invented in Paris by Louis XIV in the second half of the 17th century. This, at least, is fashion’s widely accepted creation myth. The Sun King and his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, established a luxury fashion industry which enshrined France as the world leader in taste. To help the lavish new court at Versailles eclipse the austere, black-clad glamour of Madrid, they introduced a rigid schedule whereby new fabrics were issued twice a year – not just warmer or lighter to reflect the weather, but in new colours each time – and the fashion “season” was born. </p><p>But travel 6,000 miles east to Kyoto, home of the kimono, and the history of fashion looks quite different. In the late 17th century, a demand for luxury textiles among the burgeoning Japanese merchant class grew so fast that by 1700 the narrow streets of the Nishijin district thundered to the clacking of an estimated 7,000 looms. The headquarters of Yamaguchi Genbei’s 10th generation family-run kimono business is testament to the garment’s powerful history. This elegant atelier, where studios with lacquered floors look on to a light-dappled central courtyard, helps tell the story of the kimono as an alternative narrative to a Eurocentric history of elegance. Yamaguchi’s designs, and his family collection of antique kimono, attract visitors from the highest echelons of the fashion industry. When Giorgio Armani visited last year, they spent five hours together. (Mr Armani was particularly taken with an obi with silver embroidery cascading down one vertical seam, a design based on how glaze flows on to a ceramic, Yamaguchi said.) Both Chanel and Nike have also sent sizeable delegations to pay homage to this Kyoto version of an haute couture house. Here in Japan, in other words, fashion has never been about Paris.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/01/kimono-catwalk-fashion-japan">Continue reading...</a>

But there was a problem: Christine already had a girlfriend. And another problem: Christine was interviewing Jenny for a job at the company at the time. “The first thing she did when she came in was to sit in her chair and say to me: ‘So you’re the English girl,’” Jenny recalls. “She was very direct – it wasn’t something I was used to. It felt <em>strong</em>.”</p><p>Jenny, whose parents are from Hong Kong, had decided to move there after graduating from university in 2018, to learn more about her culture. She was 22, and describes herself as extremely shy. She applied for a series of positions at creative companies, but Christine’s firm was the first to invite her for an interview; Jenny landed an entry-level position, reporting directly to Christine. Her new boss wasn’t like anyone she’d met before. She was powerful and direct in business meetings, but playful, disarming, even confessional one-to-one. She worked out and channelled a masculine, minimalist style: white shirts, blazers, black turtlenecks. She seemed to take a special interest in the English girl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/01/new-rules-of-office-romance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three inspired ideas for soup: a chicken and black-eyed bean broth, a french onion number with Yemeni flavourings, and celeriac, garlic and rice with charred lemon salsa</p><p>My four-year-old is pretty capricious. Like most boys his age, plain pasta or bread are Flynn’s first choice – always! – but he also surprises us now and then with an out-of-character enthusiasm for, say, cabbage one day or mussels the next. This makes cooking for him a chancy experience – unless soup is on offer. For reasons known only to Flynn, a soup can feature all manner of normally undesirable ingredients without so much as a peep of protest. As he’s the youngest and the loudest in the family, the rest of us have to toe the line.

<p>We’ve decided to allow other partners into our lives. There is just one problem: how to square that with having a family</p><p>Almost three years ago, my partner and I decided to experiment with opening up our relationship. More recently, we’ve “come out” as polyamorous, meaning we are free to be involved with more than one person at a time, physically and/or emotionally, in a transparent, consensual way.</p><p>In practice, this means that I currently have a wife, who I live with, along with our two-year-old son. I also have a girlfriend, who lives elsewhere and has a daughter. I love both my wife and my girlfriend deeply, in different ways.

They’ve fielded questions, sparred with critics and tweaked policies along the way. All the while their campaigns have flooded the state’s television stations with homespun stories of the candidates’ lives and their catapulting visions for a better America, crammed into a few seconds of political advertising.</p><p>Now it all comes down to Monday evening when Democrats will huddle in schools, libraries and churches across Iowa to hold the country’s first vote to decide who will challenge Donald Trump for the White House in November.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/01/iowa-caucuses-democrats-face-dilemma-us-election-2020">Continue reading...</a>

A triumph of dogged negotiation by May then, briefly, Johnson, has fulfilled the most pointless, masochistic ambition ever dreamed of in the history of these islands. The rest of the world, presidents Putin and Trump excepted, have watched on in astonishment and dismay. A majority voted in December for parties which supported a second referendum. But those parties failed lamentably to make common cause. We must pack up our tents, perhaps to the sound of church bells, and hope to begin the 15-year trudge, back towards some semblance of where we were yesterday with our multiple trade deals, security, health and scientific co-operation and a thousand other useful arrangements.</p><p>The only certainty is that we’ll be asking ourselves questions for a very long time. Set aside for a moment Vote Leave’s lies, dodgy funding, Russian involvement or the toothless Electoral Commission. Consider instead the magic dust. How did a matter of such momentous constitutional, economic and cultural consequence come to be settled by a first-past-the-post vote and not by a super-majority? A parliamentary paper (see <a href="file://Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/CBP-7212.pdf">Briefing 07212</a>) at the time of the 2015 Referendum Act hinted at the reason: because the referendum was merely advisory. It “enables the electorate to voice an opinion”. How did “advisory” morph into “binding”?

<p>As some take to the streets to celebrate leaving the EU, others mourn the loss of an old friend</p><p>How does a nation say goodbye to its neighbours? With a lump in its throat and a poignant song of farewell – or with cheers and a raised middle finger of defiant good riddance? The answer that Britain gave at 11pm on Friday 31 January 2020 was: both. The UK broke from the European Union on a late winter’s night with both jubilation and regret, as divided on the day of leaving as it had been in deciding to leave. For some Britons, this was Independence Day. For others, it was a national bereavement.</p><p>In Westminster, Nigel Farage exulted with his fellow Brexiters in Parliament Square, delighted that a prize they had sought for a quarter century, and that once seemed laughably improbable, was in their hands at last. “We did it,” he told the ecstatic crowd. “We transformed the landscape of our country.” At the stroke of 11pm, he led a chorus of the national anthem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/31/jubilation-and-bereavement-11pm-finds-the-uk-no-less-divided-over-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United scrambled around for a striker and Sheffield United broke their transfer record while Chelsea and Liverpool kept their powder dry</p><p>Mikel Arteta knew he would have limited wriggle room in his first transfer window as manager so was happy enough to add the defensive cover Arsenal desperately needed. A number of options were explored, ultimately bringing relatively risk-free loan deals for the centre-back Pablo Marí and right-back Cédric Soares. A month ago Arteta was concerned about the prospect of high-profile departures but Granit Xhaka’s situation was smoothed over and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is going nowhere for now. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/01/transfer-window-verdict-how-every-premier-league-club-fared-in-january">Continue reading...</a>
