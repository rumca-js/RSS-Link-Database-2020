But now it\u2019s an inspiration for fashion all over the world<br /></p><p>Fashion as we know it \u2013 the business of clothes-as-zeitgeist, as distinct from simple dressmaking \u2013 was invented in Paris by Louis XIV in the second half of the 17th century. This, at least, is fashion\u2019s widely accepted creation myth. The Sun King and his finance minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, established a luxury fashion industry which enshrined France as the world leader in taste. To help the lavish new court at Versailles eclipse the austere, black-clad glamour of Madrid, they introduced a rigid schedule whereby new fabrics were issued twice a year \u2013 not just warmer or lighter to reflect the weather, but in new colours each time \u2013 and the fashion \u201cseason\u201d was born. </p><p>But travel 6,000 miles east to Kyoto, home of the kimono, and the history of fashion looks quite different. In the late 17th century, a demand for luxury textiles among the burgeoning Japanese merchant class grew so fast that by 1700 the narrow streets of the Nishijin district thundered to the clacking of an estimated 7,000 looms. The headquarters of Yamaguchi Genbei\u2019s 10th generation family-run kimono business is testament to the garment\u2019s powerful history. This elegant atelier, where studios with lacquered floors look on to a light-dappled central courtyard, helps tell the story of the kimono as an alternative narrative to a Eurocentric history of elegance. Yamaguchi\u2019s designs, and his family collection of antique kimono, attract visitors from the highest echelons of the fashion industry. When Giorgio Armani visited last year, they spent five hours together. (Mr Armani was particularly taken with an obi with silver embroidery cascading down one vertical seam, a design based on how glaze flows on to a ceramic, Yamaguchi said.) Both Chanel and Nike have also sent sizeable delegations to pay homage to this Kyoto version of an haute couture house.

And another problem: Christine was interviewing Jenny for a job at the company at the time. \u201cThe first thing she did when she came in was to sit in her chair and say to me: \u2018So you\u2019re the English girl,\u2019\u201d Jenny recalls. \u201cShe was very direct \u2013 it wasn\u2019t something I was used to. It felt <em>strong</em>.\u201d</p><p>Jenny, whose parents are from Hong Kong, had decided to move there after graduating from university in 2018, to learn more about her culture. She was 22, and describes herself as extremely shy. She applied for a series of positions at creative companies, but Christine\u2019s firm was the first to invite her for an interview; Jenny landed an entry-level position, reporting directly to Christine. Her new boss wasn\u2019t like anyone she\u2019d met before. She was powerful and direct in business meetings, but playful, disarming, even confessional one-to-one. She worked out and channelled a masculine, minimalist style: white shirts, blazers, black turtlenecks. She seemed to take a special interest in the English girl.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/01/new-rules-of-office-romance\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/01/new-rules-of-office-romance", "date_published": "2020-02-01 10:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Ralf Little: \u2018My greatest achievement?
