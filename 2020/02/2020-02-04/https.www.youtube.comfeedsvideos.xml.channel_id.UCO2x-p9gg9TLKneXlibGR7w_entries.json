After six months of waiting, it finally hit the market in December of 2019. Rather than rush and put a messy review up as soon as we could, we have spent the last 40 days with it putting it through its paces and seeing if it can really compete against the Sony, Eizo, vs Flanders Scientific monitors of the world. We break down the 6K resolution, connectivity issues, GPU limitations, the $1,000 monitor stand's strengths and weaknesses, the display panel's viewing angles, color accuracy, luminance, light rolloff, vignetting issues, HDR capabilities and alleged 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio. This review is a long one that's jam packed with content so sit back and enjoy!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgEUHHp0GAU", "date_published": "2020-02-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
