<p>The glossy, groundbreaking lesbian drama returns after 10 years, for a reboot that marries a more inclusive take on LGBTQ lives with brilliantly messy, soapy plots</p><p>After 10 years away, The L Word has returned with a shiny new reboot, <a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/channel/sky-atlantic/the-l-word" title="">The L Word: Generation Q</a> (Sky Atlantic). The glossy LA lesbian drama was a cultural touchstone for many queer women, and it broke boundaries with its fun, soapy and often explicit depictions of a certain kind of wealthy Californian elite. But over the course of its original lifetime, to be a fan was to enter into a kind of weary pact with it, and its many flaws. Characters who were B or T on the LGBTQ spectrum were not treated with the greatest sensitivity. It had a tendency towards racial stereotyping. Its plots became so out there as to be borderline arthouse.</p><p>Generation Q is respectful to what came before it, while hastily dusting off the baggage its heritage entails. It combines old favourites with the horribly labelled “generation Q”, a younger set of more disparate queer men and women whose lives are intertwined with the old guard. So Bette (Jennifer Beals) is back and she’s running to be mayor of Los Angeles, Alice (Leisha Hailey) is hosting her own TV talk show (“fun, feminist … where you can drink coffee and wine”), and Shane (Katherine Moennig) arrives in the city after an absence of many years in the most preposterously Shane way possible: on a private jet – bringing the air hostess back to her new, empty mansion with her, and not for a cup of tea and a biscuit. It turns out that Shane – a character whose hair choices throughout the original were also borderline arthouse – has sold her successful chain of salons and is returning to the city that made her, carrying some heavy emotional baggage, yet soothed by lots and lots of money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/04/the-l-word-generation-q-review-its-here-its-queer-and-its-loads-of-fun">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steve Bruce was not even born when Newcastle won their sixth FA Cup in 1955. But after a superb individual goal from the substitute Allan Saint-Maximin helped them edge past Oxford in extra time, despite a stirring comeback from the League One side, the veteran manager may just allow himself a moment to dream.</p><p>Like Newcastle, Bruce has unfinished business in this competition having seen his Hull team surrender a 2-0 lead in the 2014 final against Arsenal and he will know they were fortunate to come through this contest. The visitors had been cruising <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/04/liverpool-shrewsbury-fa-cup-match-report" title="">into the fifth round</a> for the first time since 2006 with only six minutes left to play before a free-kick from substitute Liam Kelly, and Nathan Holland’s brilliant volley, turned this game on its head. With their owner, Mike Ashley, watching on in the stands, however, Saint-Maximin’s brilliant solo effort set up a trip to West Brom in the next round that will have their manager and all Newcastle supporters hoping it may finally be their year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/04/oxford-newcastle-fa-cup-fourth-round-replay-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Liverpool’s youth made their own point – they were far too accomplished for Shrewsbury and worth considering at Chelsea next time out.</p><p>Another Anfield victory ended with Liverpool’s manager punching the air in front of the Kop but, with Klopp absent, it was Neil Critchley who revelled in the moment and a performance that obeyed his pre-match instructions. “The boss was in touch this afternoon with some words of advice and encouragement,” revealed Critchley. “Play the Liverpool way, go for it. That is what the first team do. This is how we play, this is what we stand for and you had better be ready for it.

I went out to test the light and Mondino was like: “Don’t put anything else on. Maybe some more jewellery.” Then we did the picture that ended up being the album cover. In the same session I wore some BodyMaps shorts, which are in the pictures that ended up on the back and the inside, but it was a really non-wardrobe thing in the end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/04/neneh-cherry-look-i-love-judy-blame-raw-like-sushi">Continue reading...</a>

What happens if you love your other half, but are no longer ‘in love’? Here are eight ways to put the spark back<p>It is not uncommon, says Ammanda Major, head of clinical practice at Relate, for couples who come to therapy to say they love each other but that they’re not “in love” with each other. “Often in a longer-term relationship, the humdrumness of life has taken over their relationship,” she says. “And so, before you know it, people are feeling very disconnected from their partner.”</p><p>Maybe you have lost sight of what made you fall in love, or you have reached a cosy stage of companionship that lacks fire. But is it unrealistic to expect to be in love with the same person for decades? “Love, intimacy and sex does fluctuate across the lifetime and there will be stages of closeness,” says Kate Moyle, sexual and relationship psychotherapist. “I think what’s unrealistic is to expect consistency.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/04/relight-the-fire-how-to-fall-back-in-love-with-your-partner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest of a Guardian Print Shop <a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture">series</a> featuring classic sports images. This week’s picture was shot by Gerry Cranham in 1966</p><p>At the age of just 10, Jack Nicklaus carded 51 for the first nine holes of golf he ever played. By the time of this charming photograph at the World Match Play Championships in 1966, Nicklaus, then aged 26, had become a six-time major winner, the first man to retain the Masters and the youngest ever to complete a Career Grand Slam. He would go on to achieve a record haul of 18 majors in total. What was the secret of his success, you might ask. “I never try to actually hit the ball,” he explained in The Greatest Game Of All … “I try to swing <em>through</em> the ball”. Nicklaus is also fondly remembered for the charity he showed to Europe captain Tony Jacklin at the 1969 Ryder Cup, when he conceded a two-foot putt on the final hole, ending the tournament in a tie. Nicklaus reportedly told Jacklin: “I don’t think you would have missed it but I wasn’t going to give you the chance, either.” Little wonder, then, that when Nicklaus turned 80 last month, the golfing world saluted him as ‘the greatest’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/feb/04/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-the-great-jack-nicklaus">Continue reading...</a>

## Life after Veganuary: the ethical guide to eating meat, eggs and dairy

<p>If you have slunk back to burgers after a month of avoiding meat, all is not lost. Here’s how to track down high-welfare, eco-friendly produce</p><p>Veganuary is over, leaving only the remains of a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200204062850id_/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss" title="">seitan burger</a> and some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/feb/20/to-brie-or-not-to-brie-can-vegan-cheese-taste-as-good-as-dairy" title="">cashew cheese</a> in the back of the fridge. Perhaps you feel lighter and healthier; you will certainly feel more virtuous. But do you also feel like a steak? It is OK – you can admit it. The campaign group behind this annual event estimates that only half of the participants plan to remain meat-free beyond the end of the month. However, it says that <a href="https://uk.veganuary.com/blog/trying-vegan-for-january-leads-to-sustained-meat-reduction" title="">most of those will at least reduce the amount of animal products they eat</a> for the rest of the year.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/19/could-flexitarianism-save-the-planet" title="">Whether you call youself flexitarian</a>, vegan-ish or whatever, it is possible to care about the planet while occasionally eating meat or dairy, as long as it comes from ethical sources.

It is only when two of them are dead – Bufalino from complications following a stroke, and Hoffa from complications following getting shot in the back of the head – that poor Frank feels himself aware that he can unburden himself, if he wants, about the terrible secret that has been metastasizing inside him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/04/why-the-irishman-should-win-the-best-picture-oscar">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They partied, cross-dressed, launched glam and lit the fuse for punk. Is that why their dazzling artworks have been overlooked? As Them return, we meet Britain’s original scenesters<br /></p><p>In 1975, the artists Kevin Whitney and Luciana Martinez de la Rosa went to a party at the home of the disgraced Conservative MP <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/jan/02/guardianobituaries.obituaries">Lord Lambton</a>. It had been thrown by Lambton’s daughter, Anne, and the guest of honour was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/andywarhol">Andy Warhol</a>. As Whitney recalls, “the world and its mother turned up”, their enthusiasm undimmed by the paparazzi outside. The next morning, Whitney awoke to discover that the front page of the Daily Express featured a large photograph, not of the world’s most celebrated pop artist, but of himself and De La Rosa. “We looked very striking,” he says. “I was in white, Lucinda was in black. It was a big photograph, too. Apparently, Warhol was furious. And that happened because it was like, ‘Oh look – Them have arrived!’”</p><p>Such were the perils of life as a member of Them – a loose gang of artists, film-makers and designers given, as the writer Paul Burston puts it, “to living art-directed lives. They were living visual culture – people who were kicking against the pricks of quite dull 70s Britain.” It’s certainly a description that painter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2017/mar/28/david-gwinnutt-queer-art-underground-1980s-london-national-portrait-gallery#img-7">Duggie Fields</a>, a member of the group, would agree with. “We shared that attitude of there being no separation between what we create and how we live.

<p>Facial recognition technology is getting more sophisticated each year and is now being used commercially as identification instead of passwords as well as being adopted by the Metropolitan police in London. Our UK technology editor, Alex Hern, explores the questions it raises about privacy. Also today: Jamie Grierson on the security response to Sunday’s terror attack in south London </p><p>CCTV cameras are a daily reality of life in UK cities, but advances in facial recognition technology are moving police surveillance into a new phase. The Metropolitan police recently announced the introduction of live facial recognition technology, which will be limited to specific locations in London. Now a leaked Home Office paper suggests 10 other forces are also trialling this technology. </p><p>Police commissioners believe this could revolutionise the fight against crime, and after another terrorist attack this week public pressure for improved surveillance is likely to increase. However, campaigners warn that we could be ushering in the kind of society George Orwell envisaged in his dark novel Nineteen Eighty-Four.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/audio/2020/feb/04/the-rise-of-facial-recognition-technology-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

From bushfire smoke to the treatment of Navratilova and McEnroe to Djokovic’s meltdown in the final, tennis bounced from one PR disaster to the next in Melbourne<p>Few sports guard their image with as much diligence as tennis. For a fortnight the pretty face of the gentle game took a battering in Melbourne, bouncing from one public relations disaster to another, and the bruises will last.</p><p>The image meltdown began with the reluctance of the Australian Open to acknowledge with sufficient speed and clarity what everyone in the city – everyone in the country and around the world – knew about the choking effects of bushfire smoke. It then moved on to the similar impact the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/27/john-mcenroe-slams-margaret-court-as-the-crazy-aunt-of-tennis" title="">twisted moral rectitude of Margaret Court</a> had on everyone not born in the 19th century, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/29/navratilova-mcenroe-sorry-margaret-court-australian-open-tennis" title="">most publicly Martina Navratilova and John McEnroe</a>, who objected to the 77-year-old legend’s hardwired homophobia and almost forgotten apartheid apologia.
