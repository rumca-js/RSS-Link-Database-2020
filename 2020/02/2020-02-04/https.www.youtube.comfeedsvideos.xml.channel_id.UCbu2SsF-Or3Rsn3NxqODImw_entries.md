Apex Legends Season 4: Assimilation is finally here, and the new season drops a bunch of content and new changes into Respawn's battle royale. If you need a refresher on everything that has changed ahead of Season 4, we do go back and retrospect on the first year of Apex Legends.

But if you're already looking to what's new, then you're in the right place. In the video above, Tony Wilson goes over all the major changes included in Assimilation. Like Battle Charge and Meltdown, Assimilation adds a new playable character and weapon to the battle royale. The new character, Revenant, offers a new offensive option to the game while the new sniper rifle, the Sentinel, is the first weapon in Apex Legends to require charging to achieve its full potential. 

Season 4 also adds several map changes to Worlds Edge and a new battle pass. Daily and weekly challenges make their return as well, though the Ranked Mode has been adjusted. Instead of one long ranked series for the season, Assimilation will feature two series--the first on World's Edge and the second on Kings Canyon.

If you haven't yet picked up Apex Legends, we recommend that you do. In our Apex Legends review, Phil Hornshaw writes, "Apex Legends is a mix of smart shooter ideas that makes for a competitive, team-based game that gets at all the best parts of battle royale while addressing a lot of the weaknesses. Respawn's intense focus on team play makes Apex more than just a worthy addition to the genre; it's an indicator of where battle royale should go in the future."

As Apex Legends approaches its first birthday--and the start of Season 4: Assimilation--we thought it would be a good idea to take a trip down memory lane and recount the highs, lows, and major changes for Respawn's battle royale over the past year. So before Kings Canyon comes back, Revenant and the Sentinel get added, and Ranked mode changes once again, let's look back at the year that was.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée talks through Apex Legends' 12 months of history, from its surprising launch to the start of Season 4. Apex Legends has seen massive growth in that time, with the wildly popular Season 2: Battle Charge and complete map change in Season 3: Meltdown. It hasn't been all positive though--Season 1: Wild Frontier struggled to offer a reason for players to keep coming back and the Apex Legends community was not happy over the Iron Crown Collection event loot box controversy. 

Despite all of these changes, however, Apex Legends continues to be as enjoyable a game to play as it was at launch. In GameSpot's Apex Legends review, Phil Hornshaw gave the game a 9/10, writing, "Apex Legends is a mix of smart shooter ideas that makes for a competitive, team-based game that gets at all the best parts of battle royale while addressing a lot of the weaknesses. Respawn's intense focus on team play makes Apex more than just a worthy addition to the genre; it's an indicator of where battle royale should go in the future."

A human-hitman turned into a nightmare simulacrum, Revenant has been dealing death for centuries. The return of Hammond Robotics to the Outlands has given him a new target. Now his synthetics sights are set on the company that created him and any Legends who cross his path. Revenant throws out Silence devices to disable other Legends’ abilities and make them easy prey. And with his ability to scale obstacles and crouch-walk with unnatural speed, nowhere is safe. Revenant can even rescue his squadmates from death itself -- as long they’re useful to him. Become a killing machine and teach your foes the meaning of fear.
