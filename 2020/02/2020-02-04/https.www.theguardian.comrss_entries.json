The glossy LA lesbian drama was a cultural touchstone for many queer women, and it broke boundaries with its fun, soapy and often explicit depictions of a certain kind of wealthy Californian elite. But over the course of its original lifetime, to be a fan was to enter into a kind of weary pact with it, and its many flaws.

So Bette (Jennifer Beals) is back and she\u2019s running to be mayor of Los Angeles, Alice (Leisha Hailey) is hosting her own TV talk show (\u201cfun, feminist \u2026 where you can drink coffee and wine\u201d), and Shane (Katherine Moennig) arrives in the city after an absence of many years in the most preposterously Shane way possible: on a private jet \u2013 bringing the air hostess back to her new, empty mansion with her, and not for a cup of tea and a biscuit. It turns out that Shane \u2013 a character whose hair choices throughout the original were also borderline arthouse \u2013 has sold her successful chain of salons and is returning to the city that made her, carrying some heavy emotional baggage, yet soothed by lots and lots of money.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/04/the-l-word-generation-q-review-its-here-its-queer-and-its-loads-of-fun\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/04/the-l-word-generation-q-review-its-here-its-queer-and-its-loads-of-fun", "date_published": "2020-02-04 23:10:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'I am not a slapper': Labour MP hits back at criticism of attire", "description": "<p>Tracy Brabin responds to Twitter insults over shoulder-baring despatch box outfit </p><p>A Labour frontbencher has shrugged off criticism over an outfit that showed part of her shoulder in the Commons as she spoke at the despatch box.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/may/01/tracy-brabin-put-joy-back-into-early-years-education\">Tracy Brabin</a> reported that she received a series of insults over her choice of attire on Tuesday.
