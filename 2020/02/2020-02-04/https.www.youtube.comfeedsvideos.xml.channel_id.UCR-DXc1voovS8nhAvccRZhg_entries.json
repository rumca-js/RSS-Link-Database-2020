I also accidentally cover up my terminal window with my face because it's the first time I've ever done a live stream :)\n\nI will continue doing these live streams every Tuesday, and hopefully end up doing the final live production migration on YouTube soon!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyI_OwhufNk", "date_published": "2020-02-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
