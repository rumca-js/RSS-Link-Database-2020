<p>From naked dating to dirty Scrabble, singles nights and speed dating have been reinvented. Can these increasingly quirky events lead to lasting love?</p><p>‘I used to torture frogs when I was young,” the man was telling me, with a stare that would make the most experienced serial killer uneasy. I wasn’t at a Halloween party. It was Friday night in London and I was attending my first singles event. When my friend suggested it, I had expected the evening to be awkward. I hadn’t expected to be nursing a glass of a wine while a stranger described the many brutal ways he had culled the north London amphibian population. After two hours of painful conversation with other guests, we eventually escaped, although not before our new friend leaned in for a bum grope.</p><p>I was unlucky at this mixer. But even when attendees don’t turn out to be on an RSPCA watch list, singles events can feel more forced than a 90s school disco. I am not alone in my phobia of organised mixers; a recent survey by the Inner Circle revealed that 41% of daters in the UK would refuse to attend one, citing embarrassment and awkwardness as the main reasons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/17/all-tindered-out-the-surprising-return-of-the-singles-night">Continue reading...</a>

<p>ITV’s juggernaut is set to air again just two days after the tragic death of former presenter Caroline Flack. Surely a pause – and a lot of reflection – is required</p><p>Last year, when a guest on The Jeremy Kyle Show killed themselves in the week following the show’s filming, ITV acted swiftly. Kyle’s show spent its entire 14-year existence weathering controversy – a judge once described it as “human bear-baiting” – but when a person directly connected to the show had taken their own life, a quick decision was made. The show was taken off air, never to return.</p><p>Love Island is not Jeremy Kyle. It may be manipulative, it may even cross a line at times, but it does not seize on and then amplify serious, complex and often tragic issues in people’s lives in the same brazen way. Yet it has been associated with the suicides of two former contestants – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jun/21/sophie-gradon-love-island-contestant-dies-aged-32">Sophie Gradon</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/05/love-island-star-mike-thalassitis-death-was-suicide-coroner-rules">Mike Thalassitis</a> – and now its longstanding host, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/16/caroline-flack-the-sparky-presenters-death-is-a-stomach-churning-shock">Caroline Flack</a>. Gradon’s partner, Aaron Armstrong, also killed himself shortly after her funeral. Rather than cancel the show following Flack’s death, ITV2 plans to continue airing the current series tonight after only two nights off. Is that really something it should even consider?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/17/how-can-love-island-carry-on-as-normal-caroline-flack-tragic-death-itv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jenny Jenkins-Pullen, 40, a clinical psychologist, and Andrew Pullen, 49, an academic coordinator, live in Vienna</p><p>One Saturday night, Andrew saw Jenny walk down the steps to the bar in Vienna where he worked. The other bartenders recognised her as a regular, but it was the first time Andrew had seen her. He had left his job as a lawyer, and was picking up shifts in an Irish pub, the now defunct Billy’s Bones. “We all tried to serve her first,” remembers Andrew. He got there first. She ordered cider and opened a tab. </p><p>“She couldn’t see because there was a kind of lip under the bar and I wrote down ‘my future wife’ on the tab,” says Andrew. “All the other bartenders were like, dream on.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/17/how-we-met-jenny-and-andrew-bar-vienna">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Interim head coach does not have any glitz but Alexander’s Nouri’s pragmatism could help Krzysztof Piatek and co settle</p><p>After a reshuffle, it can be tough to find your bearings. As Alexander Nouri, now the interim head coach of Hertha BSC, felt his way into his new role, with the club’s sporting director Michael Preetz a few seats further down the bench, he didn’t want to tear his eyes from the action in Saturday’s game at Paderborn. Unfortunately, that also meant that when he went to take a seat, which unbeknown to him had flipped up, Nouri sat on fresh air and was left to style out his stumble as best he could.</p><p>It was the only time during his debut on the touchline that Nouri really left anything to chance – and that’s just the way Hertha wanted it after a week which Preetz described with some understatement as “turbulent”. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/11/jurgen-klinsmann-resigns-as-hertha-berlin-manager-after-10-weeks">The exit of Jürgen Klinsmann</a> after 76 days at the helm was in keeping with the rest of his time in charge in Berlin.

<p>The ex-England rugby player is ‘a full-on professional sportsman again’ but his new life in mixed martial arts is a test like no other</p><p>“I’m in the dungeon in Wembley five times a week, training with fighters, and there is no let-up,” James Haskell says as he explains his transition from being an England rugby player who won 77 caps to the far darker and more dangerous world of mixed martial arts. Haskell has also recently become a reality television celebrity, since his appearance in the Jungle, but the seriousness of trying to learn how to fight now consumes his massive frame. It is just as well because, in the next few days, the name of his first opponent will be announced as Haskell prepares to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B12rSwjpwY4">make his MMA debut on a Bellator</a> promotion.</p><p>“There’s no ‘oh let’s make it some showbiz thing’,” Haskell says, resting his battered arm in a sling after another long day at the Shootfighters gym where he is working alongside established MMA fighters who are desperate to gain the kind of recognition his past career offers him. “They treat me like every other fighter,” Haskell says of his coaches and gym-mates. “I’m bottom of the food chain. I went from being top dog to bottom feeder. It’s an interesting place.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/17/james-haskell-when-youre-being-choked-in-the-mma-cage-its-horrific">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As in Uncut Gems and Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, a symbolic stone adds weight to Bong Joon-ho’s searing satire of Korean society</p><p>When <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/bong-joon-ho">Bong Joon-ho</a> made movie history by winning a clutch of Oscars for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/07/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-south-korean-satire">Parasite</a>, he held the statuettes together afterwards, making them kiss. There is something charming about Bong taking these longed-for, career-defining objects and bashing their golden heads together. We love our treasures – since antiquity people have carved and hoarded statuettes, stones, rocks, trinkets. This is a genealogy that runs from Stonehenge to today’s most Cartier-obsessed rapper. Parasite is unashamedly about wealth, class, longing, scamming: what we want and what we’ll do to get it. Incidentally, Elon Musk, the richest man on Earth, loved the film. I wonder who he rooted for in its frenetic final scenes – the closest thing I’ve seen to class warfare on screen.</p><p>At the heart of Bong’s taut tragi-comedy is a rock, a “viewing stone” a “symbolic gift” that drives his heroes, the Kim family, to inventive and deadly extremes in pursuit of more: more money, more opportunities, a better life.

<p>Women in this flood-hit area are supporting their families through small businesses backed by the British Red Cross. From tailoring to tea making, the success of these enterprises is inspiring other young women to follow suit</p><p>In the sprawling urban slums of Barishal, where monsoons and flooding are inescapable, life for women is hard. They are more likely to miss out on getting an education, and without the proper knowledge and skill set, many struggle to make a living. As they are more likely to live in poverty, they are more affected by disasters. But despite these challenges, with the help of livelihood grants from the Red Cross, many women in Barishal are finding innovative ways to eke out a living.</p><p>Rina, 37, from Palashpur, wakes up early every day to start preparing for work. From a side road of a small slum with heavy foot traffic, she has been running a successful tea stall for the last two years. Brightly coloured crisp packets hang like a banner across her shopfront, where Rina sells roughly 160 cups of tea a day at 5 taka (under 5p) a cup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-women-of-barishal/2020/feb/17/the-breadwinners-of-barishal-how-women-in-bangladesh-are-starting-their-own-businesses">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Atlético Madrid have not passed a European knockout round since 2017 but, against Liverpool this week, Saúl sees a chance to build a Metropolitano magic</p><p>As it circles Madrid to the south, the M30 motorway emerges from the tunnel beneath the city and heads north-west across the middle of what was once the pitch at the Vicente Calderón, from <a href="https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1229072342925615104?s=20">box to box</a>. Most of the ground has been demolished but one side is just about still standing, <a href="https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1166715963854774272?s=20">the shell </a>of Atlético’s former home. Thousands drive through daily; occasionally, Saúl Níguez joins them. Some days he takes friends, aware it will soon be gone. “I tell them: ‘I scored <em>right here</em>,’” he says. “Seeing it hit you. It’s emotional.”</p><p>It is Sunday morning at Atlético’s Cerro del Espino training ground, two days before the game that will define their season and possibly beyond, and there is a significance to the scene Saúl is replaying, like something was lost when they left. “Only the main stand remains. My friends say ‘get a photo’ and I think: ‘Leave it there, people will come to see it, they’ll come.’ It’s unique, historic. The club needed to change, grow, and it’s hard to say this because we’re at the Metropolitano, which is more comfortable, but the Calderón was different: the magic it generated, the people.

<p>Cooking for one doesn’t happen often in this particular kitchen, but when it does, it’s a rare pleasure, involving simple crostini with melted cheese, and pasta with anchovy and onion</p><p>The last time I ate alone I made myself a three-egg omelette and put an anchovy on top. It looked like a slug on a quilted bed cover, but tasted absolutely right: plump where it should be, and wobbly at the centre; a crepe of eggs cooked in butter. I ate it quickly and didn’t wash the plate.</p><p>Thinking about it, a three-egg omelette is the thing I make most often for myself when I am alone, which at this particular point in my life (older mother of a young child; partner also working at home) isn’t often. I know this phase will pass and morph into another, but for now my favourite solitary meals involve ignoring all leftovers related to recipe testing, and minimum cooking: the omelette (surely the most delicious thing you can make in one minute) or scrambled egg; or three slices of country bread, halved and topped with 100g sliced cheese (mozzarella, fontina, provola or scamorza), six anchovies and a zigzag of olive oil, then baked in the oven at 180C/160C fan/gas 4 for 10 minutes so the cheese melts down the sides like an oversized tablecloth. Whether you call them <em>crostini con formaggio e alici</em> or cheese and anchovies on toast, eat them while they are so hot they sizzle in your mouth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/17/anchovy-crostini-pasta-rachel-roddy-recipes-for-one-a-kitchen-in-rome">Continue reading...</a>

My mum was his first relationship, he had no experience of dating and, even if he had, the dating ecosystem had changed out of all recognition since the days of my parents’ romance in the 70s. There were, of course, plenty of dating apps, subscription sites, singles’ activities and old-fashioned blind dates to contend with, but for him the choice was overwhelming. He would rather have settled for being alone.</p><p>Five years after my mum’s death, however, with our father’s stubborn reluctance well and truly established, my brother and I decided to take matters into our own hands. Taking advantage of the effects of the wine we had drunk for his birthday dinner, we downloaded Lumen – an app marketed as “Tinder for over-50s” – to his phone. Then we did an impromptu photoshoot and employed our best copywriting skills to sell him to the lucky ladies in a 10-mile vicinity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/17/the-people-who-matchmake-their-own-parents-looking-back-it-was-a-rash-thing-to-do">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steve Coogan’s take on Philip Green is the latest in a long list of tycoons portrayed on screen, ranging from corrupt tax avoiders to smouldering heroes</p><p>Greed is not good in Greed. Director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/michael-winterbottom">Michael Winterbottom</a>’s new satire shows us wealth in all its vanity, venality and vulgarity, as flaunted by Steve Coogan’s besieged fashion tycoon – a thinly veiled <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/philip-green">Philip Green </a>(there’s a mental image for you), with hints of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/richard-branson">Richard Branson</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/richard-caring">Richard Caring</a> and Nero. Greed – scornful of modern excess and mindful of exploitation – is just the kind of parable we need right now.

He could probably make the world a better place just by paying his taxes, but hey. Reynolds’s hero is clearly modelled on that other billionaire-playboy-genius role model of our age: Marvel’s Tony Stark, who – as we all know – is a fantasy version of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a>, except with more civic responsibility and fewer “pedo-guy” jokes.

## The point of dictionaries is to describe how language is used, not to police it | Lynne Murphy

<p>Tottenham Hotspur’s protests about the OED’s definition of the Y-word may be understandable, but are misplaced</p><p>Protests against dictionaries are nothing new. In the 1960s, distaste for the treatment of “non-standard” vocabulary such as “ain’t” in Merriam-Webster’s Third International Dictionary was so vociferous that a hostile takeover of the company was attempted, and after that failed a competitor dictionary was founded. The price of used copies of the 1934 Second International Dictionary skyrocketed as customers rejected the dictionary’s approach to controversial usages.</p><p>These days dictionary protests come and go with less drastic effects but greater regularity. Critiquing dictionary definitions gives social and political campaigns focus and attention – as in a 2019 campaign by the animal-rights organisation Peta calling on Dictionary.com to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/peta-dictionary-com-animal-definition-speciesist-humans-1466953" title="">revise its definition of “animal”</a>. Publishers’ PR departments can also catalyse controversy. The most innovative and zeitgeisty dictionary additions are highlighted in quarterly press releases about dictionary revisions, perhaps in hope of viral attention. It works. When the Collins Dictionary added plant-free foods, including <a href="https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/veganaise" title="">“veganaise”,</a> last year, <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/dictionary-revamp-as-vegans-spread-word-lp99fk87c" title="">the Times</a> asked if readers thought such words “desecrat[e] the way we speak”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/17/dictionaries-language-tottenham-hotspur-oed-y-word-definition">Continue reading...</a>

When we were leaving, we told them to let us know if they needed any help. A few weeks later, we were surprised when they called us and asked if we could help on the day of the move. We didn’t mind, but just had not expected our vague offer of help to be taken up. “Shout if you need anything,” is just something you say, isn’t it?</p><p>A few years later, in 2016, I went from being a pregnant mother of a toddler to a cancer patient overnight.

<p>The way the NHS, local authorities and private providers treat our most vulnerable people should shame us all</p><p>Adele Green is a mother of four, who lives in the Northern suburbs of Bristol. I spoke to her last week about her son, Eddie, who is now 20 years old, and living in hospital in Doncaster, 180 miles from his family.</p><p>That may seem unbearable enough, but it pales into insignificance next to what Eddie has suffered elsewhere. Variously diagnosed with autism, dyspraxia, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder" title="">ADHD</a> and more, he is now officially understood as having a learning disability with complex needs. As a child who liked cycling and dancing, and had the same caring nature he still displays, he moved through an array of educational placements before, in late 2012, he ended up at a now-defunct residential school near his home. As his mother told me last week, soon after arriving “he had a really big meltdown – it was something he couldn’t cope with, from being at home to being somewhere completely different”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/17/national-scandal-nhs-local-authorities-vulnerable-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The singer has written many beautiful songs – and was a muse for Joni Mitchell and Carole King. He reflects on his relationship with Mitchell and overcoming childhood trauma and heroin addiction<br /></p><p>James Taylor looks out at the sprawling London skyline. “This is where it started,” he says. “The moment.” He made his first trip here in 1968, playing for Paul McCartney and George Harrison and becoming the first artist signed to the Beatles’ record label, Apple Records. This was before he moved to Laurel Canyon with the rest of the denim-draped California dreamers who defined the sound of the late 60s and far beyond. Before he met David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash, Neil Young, Jackson Browne, Linda Ronstadt, Carole King and Joni Mitchell. Before he and Mitchell fell in love. Before he wrote his pivotal album Sweet Baby James during a stint in a psychiatric hospital. Before his marriage to Carly Simon, which opened up his personal life – including his long battle with heroin addiction – to public consciousness. Before he sold 100m records, performed for the Obamas and the Clintons, and then, decades later, appeared on stage with one of the world’s biggest pop stars, Taylor Swift, who is named after him.</p><p>It has been quite the trip, he admits.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/17/james-taylor-i-was-a-bad-influence-on-the-beatles-lennon-love-and-a-life-in-song">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tom Phillips, the Guardian’s Latin America correspondent, is back in Venezuela a year after the start of a dramatic, but so far unsuccessful, attempt to topple Nicolás Maduro. While conditions in Caracas appear slightly improved, outside the capital conditions in schools and hospitals are appalling – and getting worse. Also today: Jess Cartner-Morley on pockets</p><p>A year ago, the crisis in Venezuela reached a new pitch as the politician Juan Guaidó led an attempt to overthrow the country’s president, Nicolás Maduro. As the bulk of Venezuela’s military remained loyal to the president, the attempt failed and Maduro maintained his grip on power. In the months since, he has boasted that Venezuela has enjoyed “the highest levels of nutrients and access to food”. But outside of the capital Caracas, the story is very different. </p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Tom Phillips </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>of his journey through the crisis-hit country and how the worst effects are being felt by children. Hospitals are falling into disrepair, schools are being repeatedly looted and some parents have fled the country, leaving their children behind. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/feb/17/venezuela-a-year-on-from-the-failed-uprising">Continue reading...</a>
