In this third livestream, we began migrating configuration and content from my Drupal 7 site to the new Drupal 8 site using `drush migrate-upgrade` and `drush migrate-import`. We also exported the site's configuration to our code, and pushed that code up to our site's git repository. Finally, we worked through a few bugs in the migrate process relating to drush and to modules that were not enabled when they should've been.
