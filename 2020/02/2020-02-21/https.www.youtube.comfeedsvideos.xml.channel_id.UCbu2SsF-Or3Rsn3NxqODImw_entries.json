Maybe the studio responsible for the series closed its doors or perhaps an unsuccessful entry killed hype for another sequel, but there are dozens of game franchises out there that are in desperate need of a comeback.\n\nIn the video above, Richie Bracamonte discusses the seven game series that GameSpot believes needs another entry. From one-offs like Bully to fan-favorite classics like Silent Hill, all of the franchises discussed ended far too soon and deserve another chance in the spotlight.\n\nWhich video game series do you want to see make a comeback? Do you hope that Dead Space 3's cliffhanger of an ending is one day answered with Dead Space, or are you perhaps hoping that EA will see fit to finally release a Skate 4?

Naturally people will try to recreate or pay homage to their favorite game series using Dreams, and some of the results are insanely impressive.\n\nIn the video above, Ben Janca and Jean-Luc Seipke look at some of the coolest video game recreations we\u2019ve seen in Dreams so far. Bummed that Final Fantasy VII Remake got delayed? Don\u2019t worry, someone\u2019s got you covered. Can\u2019t get enough of Sonic the Hedgehog? There are multiple Sonic games in Dreams to help you get your fix. Big fan of Persona 5? Well, oh boy, do we have a Dreams creation for you.\n\nDreams is being updated with incredible and interesting new creations daily, so we naturally didn\u2019t get to cover everything in this video.

One thing you can always count on, however, is the seasonal change to inject a fresh dose of content into the game. As is usually the case, the transition into a new season brings with it meaningful gameplay changes alongside the usual new customization options. In this video we're going to break down the biggest changes that have arrived in Fortnite Chapter 2 for Season 2.\n\nWhether you're a veteran player or completely fresh to Fortnite, you'll find plenty to interest you. New content ranges from henchmen loitering around the map and new areas such as The Rig, The Grotto, The Shark, The Yacht, and The Agency,  to an interesting new story that involves spies, hideouts, fortresses, and plenty of loot--in case it wasn't abundantly clear, spies, secret agents, and subterfuge is the theme of the season. Excitingly, there's also the opportunity to align yourself with one of two factions and, at some point, you'll need to make a key decision to pledge your allegiance one way or the other.\n\nPerhaps most intriguing of all the new additions, however, is the seemingly random inclusion of Marvel character Deadpool. Whether or not he plays a big part in the events of the season remains a mystery, but at the very least it's looking like players will be able to unlock the Merc With A Mouth's outfit to use as a skin. There's plenty of other changes for Fortnite Chapter 2, Season 2, so you should watch the video for an in-depth discussion of it all.\n\n#FortniteChapter2 #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg7wouwe-Rs", "date_published": "2020-02-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
