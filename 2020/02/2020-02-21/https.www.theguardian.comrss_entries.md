<p>While some want to show solidarity with the supreme leader in face of US pressure, others feel their voice won’t be heard</p><p>At dawn, Dr Mostafa, a psychologist, went to pray at the Imamzadeh Saleh shrine in north Tehran before taking the short walk to be the first in line at the polling booth. So determined was he to do his religious duty and show his support for the supreme leader, that he voted in Friday’s parliamentary elections as soon as the polling booth opened at 8am. “We all have a duty to vote, if we want to be responsible citizens,” said Mostafa, who claims to have worked for the Iranian delegation in the Hague. Saying he had voted for the Conservatives, he added that he believed the US was “a liar”, insisting: “The parliament should never have believed American promises.”</p><p>But such enthusiasm for the parliamentary elections is likely to be the exception. By mid-afternoon there was just a smattering of people queuing to vote by the same mosque, while the nearby Tajrish bazaar was, in contrast, teeming. The mosque itself, too, seemed more attractive to mid-afternoon visitors than the chance to vote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/nothing-will-change-apathy-and-a-lack-of-queues-on-election-day-in-iran">Continue reading...</a>

## Perma-smirking Priti Patel brings the hostile environment in-house | Marina Hyde

<p>It’s the home secretary’s trickiest week since her ‘holiday’ in Israel, but at least she’s visible. Where’s the prime minister?</p><p>According to officials from one of her former departments, Priti Patel was given to coming out of her office and inquiring: “Why is everyone so fucking useless?” Very bold. This is a bit like Donald Trump coming out of his office and asking why everyone has spectacularly stupid hair. The perma-smirking Patel has now moved on to the Home Office, where this week she was accused of bullying staff, trying to oust her most senior official, and creating an “atmosphere of fear” within the department. As opposed to outside of it, which is the norm. If nothing else, it’s a failure of management. To get the best out of people who you want to do their worst, you need to create the right working environment. It’s why the offices of S.P.E.C.T.R.E have a great creche, a smoothie bar, and two “I don’t feel like killing” days per annum for every employee.</p><p>As for the Home Office, a complex department already regarded as malevolent, it is now in the hands of someone who recently gave an interview in which she repeatedly confused “counter-terrorism” with “terrorism”. This whole “Priti Patel is home secretary” scenario has the flavour of one of those US news stories where some open-carry idiot’s toddler has leant forward in their car seat and pulled a gun out of the backseat pocket. If you’re one of those people who get off on saying “I told you so”, then fine. But really, there are no good outcomes here. One of the more eye-catching Home Office briefings against her this week declared that Patel was “not committed to the rule of law”. Given she’s home secretary, that feels akin to a doctor not being committed to the idea of medicine. Should it not be vaguely disqualifying?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/21/priti-patel-hostile-environment">Continue reading...</a>

## Onward review – Pixar's best film in years is Frozen for boys

<p>The animation studio conjures some of the old magic with a touching tale of childhood grief and brotherly bonding</p><p>Once upon a time, Pixar made inventive, original family stories, but in recent years they’ve leant heavily on sequels such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/13/toy-story-4-review-new-characters-same-old-story-pixar">Toy Story 4</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/11/incredibles-2-review-brad-bird-holly-hunter-disney-pixar-animation">Incredibles 2</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/28/finding-dory-review-pixar-nemo-ellen-degeneres">Finding Dory</a>. Has the magic gone? As their first original story since 2017’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation">Coco</a>, Onward asks a similar question – and provides a very satisfactory answer. Its setting is a realm of mythical creatures who live much as modern-day humans do – less Middle-earth than 1970s fantasy art come to life. The magic has pretty much gone. The unicorns forage through suburban rubbish bins, and even though he could gallop at 70mph, the centaur cop drives a car – impractical as that may be.</p><p>Onward indicates early on that it is going to be a quest movie. It even signposts how it is not taking the straightforward route but the “path of peril”. As with the best of Pixar’s output, the journey is as much inward as outward (or onward). Our heroes are two blue-skinned elves: weedy, insecure Ian (voiced by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-holland">Tom Holland</a>) and his slow-witted elder brother Barley (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/chris-pratt">Chris Pratt</a>, channelling Jack Black), whose encyclopedic knowledge of arcane magical lore might just come in handy. Their father died before Ian was born (mum is now dating the centaur cop), but he left the brothers an odd gift to open on Ian’s 16th birthday: a spell to bring him back for a day. As anyone who has seen the trailer will know, the spell only half-works: the bottom half. All the brothers end up with is their father’s feet and legs. How to materialise the rest of him before sunset? Quest time!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/21/onward-review-pixar-tom-holland-chris-pratt">Continue reading...</a>

Multi-instrumentalist Godrich joins frontwoman Laura Bettinson and drummer/producer Joey Waronker for what they’ve described as a “cinematic sci-fi soundscape that’s both exhilarating and laser-focused” and a “celebration of our friendship”, which is a strong Venn diagram if ever there was one.</p><p>Godrich is heading to the Guardian offices at 2pm on 25 February to answer your questions about Ultraísta – and of course his most famous gig as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/radiohead">Radiohead</a>’s long-term producer (not to mention a fixture of their various side projects, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/28/atoms-for-peace-roundhouse-review">Atoms for Peace</a>, and Thom Yorke and Jonny Greenwood’s respective solo endeavours). On top of that, you can also ask him about his lauded work with U2, REM and Roger Waters, or who was the biggest diva on the 20th anniversary recording on Do They Know It’s Christmas? – not forgetting getting fired by the Strokes, and in turn firing Paul McCartney’s band before they got to work on Chaos and Creation in the Backyard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/live/2020/feb/21/nigel-godrich-webchat-ultraista-radiohead-producer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cards and contactless are convenient – but New York is right to fight for cash</p><p>The other day, New York’s city council voted to make it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/24/new-york-city-ban-cashless-businesses-discrimination" title="">illegal</a> for businesses to refuse payment in cash. The move was mainly intended to benefit people without bank accounts or credit cards. But the rest of us have reason to be grateful, too – because <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1996/09/21/study-has-tip-for-waiters-credit-card-logos-serve-them-too/2f13b12f-86d9-4e46-b27d-5d52e96a4619/" title="">study</a> after <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239810637_Do_Payment_Mechanisms_Change_the_Way_Consumers_Perceive_Products" title="">study</a> shows we spend more when we pay with a card.

Certain wires get crossed in our brains, it seems, and we confuse how easy it is to pay for something with how easily we can afford it.</p><p>Part of the explanation is that credit cards postpone the unpleasantness of actually paying until the bill arrives. But research on debit cards and digital wallets points to the more intriguing phenomenon of psychological distance: cash just feels more immediately real, and losing it feels more painful. Of course, coins and notes are “virtual”, too, in the sense that they only have any value thanks to a web of laws and agreements. But they retain a crucial component of concreteness, demonstrated most clearly by the fact that if you set fire to a £20 note, you really are £20 worse off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/21/oliver-burkeman-dont-give-up-cash-value-seeing-what-spend">Continue reading...</a>

I propose it should join with Greece to create a 21st-century museum to which the marbles would be contributed.</p><p>The museum wouldn’t be a building, but a series of travelling exhibits of artworks and inventions from around the world, organised by time period. It would underscore the reality that the world’s challenges can’t be tackled by any one country. And it would make the case that only by sharing ideas and adopting inclusive approaches will we succeed in addressing our borderless challenges. In essence, the museum would tell the story of our shared humanity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/feb/21/my-solution-to-the-parthenon-marbles-row-a-museum-for-the-21st-century">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I still think Jimmy Greaves should have started the World Cup final, so can understand City fans sticking to conspiracy theories</p><p>The footage of a suited Jimmy Greaves trying to celebrate with his England teammates while they dance around Wembley with the World Cup makes for painful viewing. As BT Sport’s excellent documentary explains, Spurs’ record goalscorer had just about got over a kick in a group game – his second recovery after getting over hepatitis that season. Alf Ramsey stuck with Geoff Hurst and you could argue it turned out to be a sensible decision.</p><p>The 1966 World Cup was the last without substitutes. With extra time, surely Ramsey would have given Greaves 20 minutes. When those people were on the pitch thinking it was all over, Jimmy wouldn’t have lamped it into the top left-hand corner – it wasn’t his style. He would have just passed it in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/21/alternate-reality-committed-football-supporter-jimmy-greaves-manchester-city">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I will accept anything they say so they think I’m a really knowledgable, good bloke</p><p>We were all getting ready to go out when my wife pointed at the kitchen ceiling and said: “That’s getting worse.” And indeed it was. Our bathroom is leaking, and our ceiling is growing a patchwork of stains and fur. I found my wife’s timing extremely insensitive. She knows how much I hate issues to do with the house, and should have waited until we got back from our excursion. She might as well have pointed at the ceiling and said, “Do you fancy thinking about this all day instead of enjoying time with the family?”</p><p>It looked serious enough to prompt immediate action. Immediate action wasn’t taken, however, and later that day we came up with the bizarre solution of showering away from the back wall of the cubicle, as that was probably where the water was leaking. This wasn’t based on evidence or science, but rather some meandering speculation while watching Netflix.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/21/something-about-builders-puts-me-on-back-foot-romesh-ranganathan">Continue reading...</a>

I don’t know.” Clearly he is less concerned about the movie’s quality than its provenance. Here he is, trying to make America great again, and a <em>foreign</em> movie takes Hollywood’s top prize, on his watch. “We got enough problems with South Korea with trade and on top of it, they give them the best movie of the year,” he complained. Let’s hope he doesn’t find out about any other foreigners winning Oscars. In the past decade, best director has been won by directors from Britain, France, Taiwan and, on five occasions, Mexico.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/21/trumps-oscars-rant-us-president-parasite-oscar-sunset-boulevard-gone-with-the-wind">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Usually, my letters have a playful tone – you can get your point across with humour</p><p>I started writing to my local paper, the Liverpool Echo, in 1978, when I was 28. One of my first letters was a response to a story about what’s known locally as Mizzie Night, an annual event with a folklore reputation, when the youth go mad, setting fire to cars and robbing pensioners at knife-point. At the time, Liverpool was a pretty lawless place: I was being ironic when I wrote in to say it was just another normal day in the city.</p><p>I soon realised there wasn’t a lot that I didn’t have an opinion on. I had opened the floodgates. It’s been more than 40 years since that first letter and I’ve written one every day. Hundreds have been published – usually three or four a week. Lots of people get angry, but they don’t know how to process their emotion. I just pick up a pen. It’s cathartic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/feb/21/experience-ive-written-a-letter-to-my-local-paper-every-day-for-40-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Photographer <strong>Harriet Zawedde </strong>was born in Rome but raised in the UK. Her series Nightshade, combines portraits with botanical images of the tomato plant and the subjects’ recipes</p><p>The English word tomato derives from the Aztec word <em>tomatl</em>. It is believed the Aztecs and Incas were cultivating and eating the tomato from 700AD. Though the tomato originated from the Andean region, it eventually spread north to Mexico. The scientific name for the tomato is <em>solanum lycoperscicum</em>.</p><p>While the Spanish were responsible for bringing the tomato to Europe in the early 16th century, its first reference in Italy was in 1544 in Pietro Andrea Mattioli’s Herbal, who refers to the tomato as <em>pomi d’oro</em> meaning golden apple. The tomato was not used in cooking until the 18th century as it was often viewed with fear and suspicion as a member of the nightshade plant family, which had plants such as the mandrake among them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/21/how-italy-blends-culture-with-cuisine-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

## Cod wars to food banks: how a Lancashire fishing town is hanging on

<p>When I grew up there, Fleetwood was a tough but proud fishing port. It’s taken some knocks in the years since, but not everyone has given up on it. By Luke Brown</p><p>My parents moved to Fleetwood on the coast of Lancashire in the years when the British fishing industry was beginning its dramatic decline. In 1976 the North Sea trawlers had lost the rights to fish the Icelandic waters where the majority of Fleetwood’s cod was caught. Cod fishing had been vital to the town’s economy, and remains part of its identity: a person from Fleetwood is a “cod head”– a term used as an insult by our neighbours but as an endearment by us. The supporters of Fleetwood Town FC are the Cod Army. The town’s biggest manufacturer is Lofthouse, makers of Fisherman’s Friend lozenges, which were first concocted in Victorian times to relieve the colds that deckhands would catch from working days and nights in the freezing wet.</p><p>My parents, originally from Gloucestershire, had moved to Fleetwood for their first teaching jobs when I was two years old. They found it forbidding at first, living at the end of a narrow peninsula surrounded by water on three sides. “It was so empty,” my mother told me. “Walking along the prom when we arrived in November was like looking out at an old painting of a storm. It felt like we were completely cut off.” When I started school, my new friend Mike asked me: “Why do you talk like Prince Charles?” (I had rhymed grass with arse.) At which point I started to speak like a northerner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/21/cod-wars-to-food-banks-how-fleetwood-lancashire-fishing-town-is-hanging-on">Continue reading...</a>

## Céline Sciamma: 'In France, they don’t find the film hot. They think it lacks flesh, it’s not erotic'

<p>Her new film Portrait of a Lady on Fire is the year’s most erotic film: a meditation on passion, art and feminism. But the film-maker says her native country just doesn’t get it</p><p>Céline Sciamma’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/20/portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire-review-celine-sciamma" title="">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a> should carry a health warning: “This film may cause uncontrollable swooning.” Everywhere the French director’s period lesbian romance has been screened – 40 film festivals in total, from Cannes to Aspen and Zurich – it has produced a dizzied, infatuated reaction of the sort not usually associated with a subtitled drama about enlightenment- era portrait artists. All over the globe, Sciamma has seen the passion her film generates, “a tension with the audience – there’s electricity. That’s the thing when you make a love story. You get a lot of love.”</p><p>Well, with one exception. “In France, they don’t find the film hot,” says Sciamma matter-of-factly. “‘[They think] it lacks flesh, it’s not erotic. It seems like there are some things that they can’t receive.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/21/celine-sciamma-portrait-of-a-lady-on-fire">Continue reading...</a>
