Hey Laowinners!

Today I would l like to talk about how my experience living in China for over 10 years, measures from top down leadership are often praised by the rest of the world for being swift, and effective. China's culture of Guanxi, or connections, and messy and often arbitrary enforcement of law means that these measures simply only work on paper.
