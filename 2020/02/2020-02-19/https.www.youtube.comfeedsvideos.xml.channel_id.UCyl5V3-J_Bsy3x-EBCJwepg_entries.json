Mayor Goodway as hysterical, bumbling, incompetent.\"\r\n\r\n   \"I would argue that the Paw Patrol, as a private corporation, is used to help provide basic social services in the Adventure Bay community. That's problematic in that the Paw Patrol creators are sending this message that we can't depend on the state to provide these services.\"\r\n\r\n   Story 2 -  New Political Bible Adds (R) Or (D) After Each Character's Name\r\n\r\n Become a paid subscriber at https://babylonbee.com/plans", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwLNlSHS_KI", "date_published": "2020-02-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
