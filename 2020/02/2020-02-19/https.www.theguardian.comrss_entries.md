## The ‘Greenies’ did not start Australia’s bushfires. But lies are often more powerful than the truth | Adrian Chiles

<p>A good conspiracy theory trumps boring old facts. As I learned during a run-in with some Spanish football fans …<br /></p><p>I smelled something terrible earlier this month, shortly after flying into Sydney. I stepped out of the terminal building to be smacked in the face by the unmistakable stench of forest fire. I’d read all about it, of course. But nothing prepared me for this.</p><p>Before I left the UK, a couple of otherwise smart people I know with friends in Australia told me the fires were caused by environmentalists, or the Greenies, as they’re known there. Apparently they had got in the way of judicious burning of sections of forest ahead of the fire season, to help tame the wildfires when they came. These Greenies, honestly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/19/greenies-australia-bushfires-lies-more-powerful-truth-adrian-chiles">Continue reading...</a>

## Clijsters returns to tennis with renewed energy the overriding goal

<p>The former world No 1 tasted defeat after her latest comeback but has found returning to training transformative</p><p>When Kim Clijsters announced her first comeback to professional tennis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/09/kim-clijsters-returns-tennis-retirement">in the </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/aug/09/kim-clijsters-returns-tennis-retirement">summer of 2009</a>, the news was met with joy. It seemed right and just. In the first stanza of her career she established herself as one of the best players in the world while surrounded by legends, but her career was always defined by what it lacked: she was a freakish athlete who made crowds gasp every time she routinely slid into full splits at full speed on hard courts, but she had lost her first four slam finals. She was a choker, people said. After finally winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/sep/12/tennis.usopentennis2005">her first slam at the US Open in 2005</a>, Clijsters departed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/06/tennis">two years later at the age of 2007</a>. It felt like she still had more to give.</p><p>Clijsters’s comebacks took even herself by surprise. She had been invited to the opening of the Wimbledon Centre Court roof in 2009 for an exhibition with Steffi Graf, Andre Agassi and Tim Henman. As she worked herself into shape for the match, the joy of discipline and setting goals returned. She made her way back into the sport just a couple of months later, embarking on one of the most legendary comebacks in the process. In her third tournament back, still without a ranking to her name, she beat <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/serena-willliams-us-open-semi-final">Serena Williams in </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/13/serena-willliams-us-open-semi-final">a controversial US Open semi-final</a> and went on win the tournament, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2009/sep/14/kim-clijsters-comeback-us-open-win">beating 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki in the final</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/19/kim-clijsters-returns-tennis-energy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Four people in an English market town search for meaning in their lives in this quirky but underpowered comedy</p><p>Benjamin Verrall’s film is a quirky, low-key if underpowered British indie set in Lewes, East Sussex, and although it never quite came alive as a film, there are some nice moments. It could yet work well as a pilot for a TV series.</p><p>Tony (Steve Watts) is a gentle, sensitive middle-aged guy without a partner who owns an independent publishing company and regularly visits his aged mum (Lucinda Curtis) who is in a care home. Alison (Isabella Marshall) is his office manager, a woman on whom Tony, in his muddled emotional state, has persuaded himself he has a crush. The firm employs shy, difficult young Alf (Howard Perret) to create promotional videos to advertise their books on social media, and Alf has a talent somewhere between Jim Henson and Michel Gondry. Poor Alf is falling hard for Josie (Sophia Carpasso) who – like him – is an artist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/19/incidental-characters-review-benjamin-verrall">Continue reading...</a>

Leading classical stage actor and four-times Tony award winner, whose career spanned three continents<p>Zoe Caldwell, who has died aged 86 after suffering from Parkinson’s disease, was one of the leading classical stage actors of the last century and won four Tony awards on Broadway, for her performances in Slapstick Tragedy, by Tennessee Williams (1966), and as Muriel Spark’s Miss Jean Brodie (1968), Euripides’ Medea (1982) and Terrence McNally’s Maria Callas in Master Class (1995). Her career was spread across three continents, so her reputation for the ferocity and musical intensity of her acting – she was a small woman with a large voice and gutsy physical presence – never grew to the proportions it merited.</p><p>She went to Stratford-upon-Avon for the last two seasons before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/sep/12/peter-hall-obituary-british-theatre-rss-national" title="">Peter Hall</a> launched the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1961 and appeared as Bianca to Paul Robeson’s Othello, Cordelia to Charles Laughton’s King Lear, and with Laurence Olivier and Edith Evans in Coriolanus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/19/zoe-caldwell-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

She once asked: “What’s the difference between Napoleon and everyone else? Napoleon had great image branding.” Given that her style and hair colour changed in every photo, Boucher disrupted the possibility of ever solidifying into the kind of stable pop silhouette connoted by either bicorne hat or cone bra. She craved a new archetype: whether she resembled a space lieutenant or racoon-eyed wraith, the one consistent would be her iconoclastic skill as the sole producer of her music.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/19/pop-star-producer-or-pariah-the-conflicted-brilliance-of-grimes">Continue reading...</a>

At its heart, the system is designed to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/18/uk-to-close-door-to-non-english-speakers-and-unskilled-workers" title="">significantly reduce low-skilled immigration</a> from the EU (by 140,000 per year).

You let someone do what they’re good at, or enjoy, so there’s more chance they’ll actually do it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/feb/19/the-filth-factor-how-to-draw-up-the-perfect-cleaning-rota-sign-a-contract">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The directors celebrated in a new season at the Barbican – focusing on films about men, made by women – on turning the traditional gaze on its head</p><p>When Ana Kokkinos found out her second film was going to be shown at Cannes in 1998, she was overjoyed. Charting 24 hedonistic hours in the life of a gay Greek-Australian teenager, Head On is a fierce and evocative depiction of queer identity and masculinity in crisis. Then she had her first interview. “The journalist told me there was a rumour that I must have been a man because a woman couldn’t possibly make this film.”</p><p>The Australian film-maker was unsurprised. “There aren’t many female directors and when women get the opportunity to make a film they tend to want to make them about women. But when women make films about men there is still a taboo around that.

<p>The now-former BBC pundit’s comments highlight the burden placed on players to somehow tackle the racism they suffer</p><p>It’s worth reading the comments made by local BBC pundit – now former BBC pundit – Craig Ramage in the wake of Derby’s 1-1 draw with Huddersfield on Saturday. “When I look at certain players,” Ramage judged, “their body language, their stance, the way they act, you just feel, hold on a minute, he needs pulling down a peg or two. So I’d probably say that about all the young black lads … that, you know, it’s about, when you are struggling for form, you are going through a sticky patch, it’s about going back to basics, working hard, and doing the right things.”</p><p>Well there you go.

I am also disappointed that a public service broadcaster did not step in to ask the analyst to explain his reasoning or to distance themselves from these archaic thoughts.” Quite. And we’ll come shortly to the depressing regularity with which pushback against racism ends up having to be player-led.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/19/craig-ramage-young-black-lads-mindset-reflects-football-inaction-racism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fast-growing sport of dog agility has become one of the most popular events at shows like Westminster and a welcome alternative for those who believe conformation shows are archaic and outmoded</p><p>The sport of dog agility is easy to grasp for a first-time spectator. The object is simple: Unleashed dogs negotiate a serpentine obstacle course – clearing a series of jumps, weaving their way around poles, darting through tunnels, hurdling through tires, sprinting up and down ramps and a seesaw – as quickly as possible under the guidance of their handler, who can rely only on voice cues and body language.</p><p>At the highest form it’s dressage on uppers, marrying the human-animal bond and precision of equestrian sports with the frenetic pace and inherent volatility of alpine skiing, where the margins that separate first place and disaster are often down to hair-trigger decisions imperceptible to the untrained eye. To the unfamiliar, it can seem like magic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/19/dog-agility-westminster-perry-dewitt-jessica-ajoux">Continue reading...</a>
