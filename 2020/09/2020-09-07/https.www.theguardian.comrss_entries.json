But even as the shenanigans continue (and they will endure even into his final years \u2013 as a sick, old man, his sexual pride induces him to tell his assistant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/12/david-dawson-lucian-freud-interview\">David Dawson</a> that the blood on his sheets, the result of one of his nosebleeds, \u201cmight be a girl\u2019s\u201d) the reader detects a certain change in atmosphere. This has to do not only with Freud\u2019s growing success \u2013 in 1974, there will be a retrospective of his work at the Hayward Gallery; his prices will shortly rise dramatically \u2013 but with his ambition. \u201cHow far can you go?\u201d he would sometimes murmur to himself, looking at a painting that was almost complete. The answer was: much further. Ahead of him lie another 40 years in the studio.</p><p>Feaver\u2019s narrative, peppy and mostly nimble, is based in part on the near daily phone calls and many encounters the two men had over several decades (as the artist RB Kitaj once told him, not entirely accurately, he played Boswell to Freud\u2019s Johnson). What\u2019s good about this is that you can hear Freud\u2019s voice on the page, which is thrilling when he\u2019s talking about art (\u201cYou feel he\u2019s telling lies,\u201d he says of Caravaggio, getting straight to the heart of the matter). What\u2019s bad about this is that, as Dawson notes: \u201cWhat he [Freud] says and how he feels are not the same thing. Ever.\u201d Their somewhat symbiotic relationship also means that Feaver is apt to accept Freud\u2019s disdain for interpretation, whether of art or human nature. Early on, a bit comically, he asks the artist if <em>Naked Man </em><em>With Rat</em> <em>(1977-8)</em> relates to <em>Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis</em> by his grandfather, Sigmund Freud \u2013 an essay about a young man \u201ctortured by rats or the thought of rats, viz the anal erotic source\u201d. But, no. His model just happened to like the rat. After this, he resists the temptation to indulge in what Freud called \u201cthe dodgy therapeutic aspect\u201d of connecting life and work.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/07/the-lives-of-lucian-freud-fame-1968-2011-by-william-feaver-review\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/07/the-lives-of-lucian-freud-fame-1968-2011-by-william-feaver-review", "date_published": "2020-09-07 06:00:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "At 31, I have just weeks to live.
