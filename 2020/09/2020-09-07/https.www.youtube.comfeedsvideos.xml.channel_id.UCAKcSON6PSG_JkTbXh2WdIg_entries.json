The Minnesota State Fair didn't happen in 2020, but hearing these awesome performances of lively songs will stir hope that the Great Minnesota Get-Together will reconvene again someday.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Red Shoes\" \n2:45 \"Pocket\" \n5:52 \"Sunshine\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nDavina Sowers \u2013 piano, vocals\nMatt Blake \u2013 bass\nSteve Rogers \u2013 trombone \nZack Lozier \u2013 trumpet\nConnor McRae Hammergren \u2013 drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/04/18/davina-and-the-vagabonds-perform-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#davinaandthevagabonds #davinavagabonds #mnstatefair", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QuPgN6CpGdA", "date_published": "2020-09-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
