UK
Cases, (App) + 2,605

COVID symptoms in the UK, 29, 022

Daily cases

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

UK lockdown date, 23rd March

Now

Cases, + 3,000

Tests, + 170,000

Peak

Cases, + 4, 845

Tests, + 65,000

Unknowns from first peak

Mostly only testing people in hospital

Antibodies only last about 10 weeks

Significant surveys not done in time

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/201833/cell-immunity-what-does-help-protect/

T cell tests would be good

App Data (Zoe, King’s College, Tim)

https://covid.joinzoe.com/data#interactive-map

1st April, Prevalence

Over 2, 100 000 cases

Assume symptoms last for 10 days

1st April , Incidence

Cases, + 200, 000,

+ 20% for asymptomatics = Cases, + 240, 000

+ more symptoms now recognised

Deaths peak

ONS, Deaths peaked w/e 19th April (week 16)

UK, 9, 495 for the week

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest#main-points

= 1, 351 deaths per day

So peak CFR
Cases = 4,845
Deaths = 1,351
CFR = 27 %

Peak IFR
Cases, 240,000
Deaths, 1,351
IFR = 0.56%

https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/estimating-the-infection-fatality-ratio-in-england/

IFR falling over time

ONS, IFR, as of 4 August, 0.49% 

MRC, IFR, as of 28 July, 0.30% 

Without lockdown

 Exponential growth up to 40, 000, 000 infections

Less deaths in younger people

More deaths due to overwhelmed NHS

5% of 40, 000, 000 = 2 million

Measles

https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles

During 2000- 2018, measles vaccination prevented 23.2 million deaths

73% drop in measles deaths

2018

86% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday

140 000 measles deaths globally, children under the age of five

Vaccine optimism

William Petri, Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, University of Virginia

The immune system clears the virus in 99% + of infections

https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/covid-19-has-mortality-rate-declined

Some may have low levels of virus in the body for up to three months

Not normally infectious after day 10

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/end-home-isolation.html

Immune system fails to clear HIV

SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t mutate as HIV does

SARS-CoV-2 needs its spike protein to be infectious

https://theconversation.com/what-is-the-ace2-receptor-how-is-it-connected-to-coronavirus-and-why-might-it-be-key-to-treating-covid-19-the-experts-explain-136928

Antibodies have been proved (in vitro) to bind to the spike protein

Therefore neutralizing the spike protein

Vaccines in clinical trials, generate spike protein antibodies

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/806

Monoclonal antibodies could give passive immunity

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/752

Seven companies developing MABs

Currently being trial for post exposure protection

May also be effective for treatment

Spike protein has many locations where antibodies can bind

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/643

Many vulnerable spots

Therefore, many protein changes in the spike protein would be needed to evade neutralizing antibodies

If there were to be several sike protein mutations it would no longer bind into the ACE-2 receptor anyway

Vaccination science is developed

Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection

Allergic reactions

Use of adjuvants
