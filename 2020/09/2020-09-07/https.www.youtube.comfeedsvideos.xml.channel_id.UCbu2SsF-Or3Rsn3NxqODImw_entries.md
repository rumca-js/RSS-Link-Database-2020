The Xbox Series S has finally been officially unveiled, and the "smallest Xbox ever" will only cost $299 when it launches on November 10. Plus, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, a Breath of the Wild prequel, will release later this year, but we'll have to wait a little longer for news on Breath of the Wild 2. 

A Breath of the Wild prequel, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity has been announced. It'll be a mix of combat and puzzle solving, and you'll be able to play as Zelda, Link, as well as the four champions: Mipha, Revali, Daruk, and Urbosa.

On top of today's Age of Calamity announcement, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma asked fans to "wait a bit longer" for Breath of the Wild 2 news. We last saw the game at E3 2019 when it was revealed.
