For the past year, Kyah, her mother and her older sister have been living out of a single room in a relative’s house — experiencing what’s been called “hidden homelessness” in order to avoid entering the shelter system. The coronavirus pandemic has only amplified their struggles. Meet Kyah and her family in a scene from "Growing Up Poor in America" that explores the difficult-to-measure phenomenon of "hidden homelessness."
