## Sue Perkins: Along the US-Mexico Border review – darkness leavened with a dash of wit

<p>More of a travelogue than a documentary, Perkins begins in the border town of Tijuana, where she finds tequila-fuelled parties sit uneasily alongside the scale of asylum seekers’ suffering</p><p>Watching Sue Perkins present a programme always brings to mind the moment in Blackadder when Edmund, in financial straits, is showing prospective buyers around his home. “You’ve really worked out your banter, haven’t you?” says one of them. “No, not really,” replies Blackadder. “This is a different thing – it’s spontaneous, and it’s called wit.”</p><p>Wit is Perkins’ USP. All presenters have warmth and intelligence, though both can vary in degree and kind, and in the proportions in which they are blended. But it is Perkins’ ability to think on her feet – and, I suppose, the willingness of her editors to keep it in and not flatten her into traditional affectlessness – that marks her (and the likes of Grayson Perry and Paul O’Grady when he lets rip) out. It adds zest to proceedings. This is always welcome, even when – as with last night’s opening episode of the two-part <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mfw7">Sue Perkins: Along the US-Mexico Border </a>(BBC One) – the programme’s subject matter is notably colourful stuff on its own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/07/sue-perkins-along-the-us-mexico-border-review-darkness-leavened-with-a-dash-of-wit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For more than a quarter of this fixture, a placing in Scotland’s congested international hall of shame beckoned. The Czech Republic, having cobbled an entire team together at 48 hours’ notice after Covid-related issues, held a well-deserved advantage in Olomouc and the visitors were toiling badly. There was cause for the Czechs to wonder why on earth, in an apparent weekend panic, they tried to have the tie postponed.</p><p>A Lyndon Dykes goal, his first for Scotland, on his second appearance, preceded Ryan Christie earning his team respectability from the penalty spot. Yet there should not be, and will not be, any whooping and hollering after unconvincing success against a squad where only two players had sampled international football before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/07/czech-republic-scotland-nations-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Regina King’s movie puts Malcolm X, Cassius Clay, Jim Brown and Sam Cooke in a hotel room together in 1964. The result is immensely watchable</p><p>The premise is the Fantasy Football of drama: imagine a select bunch of historical figures, together in one room, putting the world to rights. Tom Stoppard’s play Jumpers (Lenin, Tzara, James Joyce) set the trend, and more recently, Kemp Powers’s 2013 play One Night in Miami imagined a summit between four African-American legends: Malcolm X, Cassius Clay (soon to become Muhammad Ali), football hero turned movie star Jim Brown and soul legend Sam Cooke. In fact, these four really did meet in Miami in February 1964.</p><p>Powers has now adapted his play for the debut feature by actor and director Regina King (TV’s Watchmen, Barry Jenkins’s If Beale Street Could Talk). King opens out Powers’s drama somewhat, notably in an extended intro, but the action is largely restricted to a single hotel room. The occasion for the meeting is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/feb/26/cassius-clay-defeats-sonny-liston-world-heavyweight-boxing-champion-1964">Clay-Sonny Liston fight</a> in Miami – after which Malcolm X summons the other three to celebrate Clay’s championship win. The guests expect a party, only to find that their sober-minded host intends an evening of “reflection” – with ice cream the only refreshment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/one-night-in-miami-review-regina-king">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A row with the EU over state aid may show red wall voters the PM is attuned to their concerns. But at what cost? </p><p>Boris Johnson won the last election in part because he could say on what terms he would leave the European Union and his opponents could not. He had an “<a href="https://uk.news.yahoo.com/boris-johnson-brexit-no-deal-guy-verhofstadt-144717564.html" title="">oven-ready</a>” deal. Yet the agreement Mr Johnson secured with the EU was one that his predecessor Theresa May had <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/brexit-philip-hammonds-brutal-takedown-20734899" title="">rejected</a> because it split Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, placing the province in the regulatory orbit of Brussels. The prime minister knew this because he had made the same criticism. Last autumn, cornered by his own logic but desperate for a deal, Mr Johnson signed up to a dud agreement.</p><p>The damaging consequences of his choices were threatening to capsize EU-UK trade talks. Mr Johnson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/06/five-weeks-clinch-brexit-deal-uk-move-boris-johnson-to-say" title="">solution</a> was to go back on the deal he had negotiated. The impression is that Mr Johnson’s words are not worth the paper they are written on. If this was allowed there could be no confidence that the UK would stick to its side of the bargain in any trade arrangement. A Britain which reneges on international agreements can hardly lecture rogue states when they do the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/07/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-brexit-my-word-is-not-my-bond">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The film-maker was at the Paris concert venue when attackers opened fire. His debut feature is inspired by his gruelling journey to recovery</p><p>‘For three days after the Bataclan, I thought I was dead,” says Ismaël el Iraki, whose debut feature, Zanka Contact, about two lost souls recovering from PTSD, is playing at the Venice film festival. It’s a Wild at Heart-type love story starring Ahmed Hammoud and Moroccan music star Khansa Batma with debts to Quentin Tarantino and Sergio Leone. A car crash throws together a has-been rocker who has just returned to Casablanca and a streetwise con-artist, who get lulled into the shenanigans of the city’s music underworld.</p><p>Zanka Contact riffs on the director’s experiences trying to recover from all he witnessed at the Eagles of Death Metal concert at Paris’s Bataclan venue in November 2015, when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/20/bataclan-witnesses-recount-horror-paris-attacks">gunmen massacred 90 people</a> in a night of coordinated attacks by terrorists that left 143 dead and hundreds injured. El Iraki stared at the gunman as he pulled the trigger. The bullet scraped past him. He was preparing to die when the fearless actions of a <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-france-shooting-bataclan-hero/you-saved-my-life-paris-attack-survivors-seek-solace-with-bataclan-security-man-idUKKCN0VY2NH">security guard called Didi</a> saved him. Oblivious to his personal wellbeing, Didi kept returning to the concert hall, leading the injured and distressed to safety. “I saw a hero with my own eyes,” recalls El Iraki, who escaped through the front door of the building. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/07/ismael-el-iraki-film-zanka-contact-bataclan-terror-attack-paris">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nancy Guri Duncan, 75, and François Le Diascorn, 73, met in India while they were travelling as reporters in 1971. They live together in the south of France</p><p>In 1971, Nancy Guri Duncan was working as a freelance journalist in south-east Asia. “I’m from the US, but I was in Vietnam covering the war,” she says. “That summer, I went to Chennai (then known as Madras) in India to meet a friend from the US. We travelled together to Kolkata (then Calcutta) and arrived at a Salvation Army guesthouse.” They were told to wait in the breakfast area while their room was being prepared. A few minutes later, François Le Diascorn joined them at their table with another young Frenchman. “At the time, we were trying to start our careers as war photographers,” he says. “We’d come to India because we were interested in investigating the conflict on the Indian-Pakistani border.”</p><p>That evening, Nancy and François talked about their careers and future plans. “I was smitten that night,” she admits. “François seemed like the sort of person I could be with.” However, he and his friend were leaving the following day to travel to the border. “I was really upset, but my friend told me to get his name and address. It wasn’t much to go on.” François also liked Nancy, but thought it was an “impossible” situation. “She was American, I was French and we were both going to be in different places. I didn’t see how it could work.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/07/how-we-met-i-hitchhiked-to-kathmandu-and-spent-days-searching-for-her">Continue reading...</a>

<p><em>Yersinia pestis </em>killed millions of people across Europe in the middle ages. Today it remains a deadly threat to one of the US’s most endangered species</p><p>Every year, from August to November, Travis Livieri becomes nocturnal. The field biologist goes out in his truck in Conata Basin, South Dakota, armed with a spotlight in search of one of the most endangered mammals in North America: the <a href="https://nc.iucnredlist.org/redlist/amazing-species/mustela-nigripes/pdfs/original/mustela-nigripes.pdf">black-footed ferret</a>. When the light catches the reflective green shine of the ferret’s eyes, he waits for the animal to disappear into a burrow and then lays a trap at the entrance.</p><p>Once the ferret is trapped, Livieri coaxes it into a long black tube and anaesthetises it before giving it a vaccine shot. Then he takes a blue marker and draws a line from the ferret’s left ear to its right shoulder. About a month later, he returns again at night to the same location to give the ferret its booster, drawing a line from its right ear to its left shoulder. Ferrets marked with an X are safe from the plague.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/07/an-invisible-enemy-the-battle-to-save-black-footed-ferrets-from-the-plague-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

## The Lives of Lucian Freud: Fame 1968-2011 by William Feaver – review

<p>The second volume of Feaver’s compelling biography reveals the ruthlessness behind the artist’s brilliance</p><p>When the second volume of William Feaver’s fat and extremely juicy biography of Lucian Freud begins, the artist is middle-aged: not far off 50, and still shinning up his lovers’ drainpipes (in this case, Jacquetta Eliot, the Countess of St Germans, with whom he’ll have a son, Freddy). But even as the shenanigans continue (and they will endure even into his final years – as a sick, old man, his sexual pride induces him to tell his assistant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/feb/12/david-dawson-lucian-freud-interview">David Dawson</a> that the blood on his sheets, the result of one of his nosebleeds, “might be a girl’s”) the reader detects a certain change in atmosphere. This has to do not only with Freud’s growing success – in 1974, there will be a retrospective of his work at the Hayward Gallery; his prices will shortly rise dramatically – but with his ambition. “How far can you go?” he would sometimes murmur to himself, looking at a painting that was almost complete. The answer was: much further. Ahead of him lie another 40 years in the studio.</p><p>Feaver’s narrative, peppy and mostly nimble, is based in part on the near daily phone calls and many encounters the two men had over several decades (as the artist RB Kitaj once told him, not entirely accurately, he played Boswell to Freud’s Johnson). What’s good about this is that you can hear Freud’s voice on the page, which is thrilling when he’s talking about art (“You feel he’s telling lies,” he says of Caravaggio, getting straight to the heart of the matter). What’s bad about this is that, as Dawson notes: “What he [Freud] says and how he feels are not the same thing. Ever.” Their somewhat symbiotic relationship also means that Feaver is apt to accept Freud’s disdain for interpretation, whether of art or human nature. Early on, a bit comically, he asks the artist if <em>Naked Man </em><em>With Rat</em> <em>(1977-8)</em> relates to <em>Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis</em> by his grandfather, Sigmund Freud – an essay about a young man “tortured by rats or the thought of rats, viz the anal erotic source”. But, no. His model just happened to like the rat. After this, he resists the temptation to indulge in what Freud called “the dodgy therapeutic aspect” of connecting life and work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/07/the-lives-of-lucian-freud-fame-1968-2011-by-william-feaver-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The majestic tree, outside Bow Road station in the East End, has seen generations of Londoners – rich and poor – pass under its branches</p><p>In the 33 years since Karen Bollan moved to Bow, in the East End of London, the area has changed dramatically. “When I arrived, admitting that I lived in the East End always implied crime and poverty,” says Bollan. “The large, fancy houses had fallen on hard times. But over the past 10 years, Bow has become desirable. Now, houses are worth millions and my adult children can’t afford anywhere near where they were born and raised.”</p><p>There has, however, been one constant: a humongous horse chestnut right outside Bow Road station. “This tree must have been here for a very long time, possibly 150-200 years,” says Bollan, who is 55. “My husband, who was born in the flats just behind the tree, remembers it seeming just as large and imposing when he was a child more than 60 years ago.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/07/tree-of-the-week-a-horse-chestnut-that-witnessed-the-fall-and-rise-of-east-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There has been little appreciable gain in price during the time the house was let</p><p><strong>Q</strong> We are in the process of selling our former family home which has been rented out for the past eight years. We lived there from 1987 until 2012.</p><p>The value of the house increased from the £91,500 we paid for it in 1987 to £325,000 in 2012, but has gained only £5,000 since then as we have just accepted an offer of £330,000. As there has been little appreciable gain in price during the time it was let, how is the actual gain calculated?

<p>The Repair Shop star’s most awesome job of restoration was … himself. He tells how he overcame racist teachers, police brutality, homelessness and a breakdown</p><p>The Repair Shop is about many things. People bring items to its picturesque thatched barn workshop to be brought back to life in front of the BBC show’s cameras. It’s about the skill and meticulousness of the restorers’ work, a chance to see the inner workings of an object, an echo of a time when we fixed things instead of buying new. One less thing destined for landfill.</p><p>Mostly, says Jay Blades, The Repair Shop’s presenter, without a hint of sentimentality, it’s “about love”. It’s about loss, and memory, and how objects once cherished by loved ones can carry huge weight for those left behind. Some of the grief is still raw and recent. It’s also about new beginnings, he says. “How if something’s broken, you can put it back together. And sometimes that’s quite a metaphor for us in life – that if we’re broken, we need to know how we can fix ourselves.” Blades knows a lot about that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/07/jay-blades-repair-shop-love-loss-liberating-power-tears">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Recent acrimony as well as historical rivalry are making a crucial agreement on European access to British waters look increasingly remote</p><p>Fishing has always been one of the biggest hurdles to a post-Brexit deal between the EU and UK.

<p>Guardian writer Sirin Kale spoke to friends and family of Belly Mujinga about her life and death. Belly, a transport worker and mother to an 11-year-old girl, developed Covid-19 after being allegedly spat on during her shift at London’s Victoria station. Her death made headlines and raised pressing questions about racial injustice</p><p>Belly Mujinga, 47, was working on the concourse of Victoria station in central London on the morning of 22 March when an alleged incident took place that she said involved a man claiming he had Covid 19 and spitting at her. Belly later developed the virus and died on 5 April. Her death went on to make headlines and an investigation was launched. British Transport Police concluded their investigation, saying the 57-year-old man they identified from CCTV had produced a negative antibody test, showing he did not have the virus, and that there was not enough evidence to prove he had deliberately spat or coughed at Belly.</p><p>Guardian writer <strong>Sirin Kale</strong> tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about investigating the life and death of Belly Mujinga. She describes meeting Lusamba Gode Katalay, Belly’s husband, and Agnes Ntumba, her cousin, who both described Belly as a loving wife, devoted mother, and kind and compassionate colleague. Sirin looks at how the story – of a frontline worker assaulted while doing her job, a black woman whose death went uninvestigated until a global anti-racism campaign forced the British authorities to take note – made Belly a symbol of racial injustice. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/07/the-life-and-death-of-belly-mujinga">Continue reading...</a>
