It seams Apple really doesn't want you to repair your own phone. With the iPhone 11 introducing more paired components than ever before, its time i tried to fix mine which has a badly cracked screen and faulty cameras. 
If a manufacture is successfully able to completely lock down 3rd party repairs, what happens after they drop support for the product? Are we supposed to throw it away and buy a new one? I refuse to support that business model and will try anything to stop it from happening.
I will be sticking with my current fruit phone, from Blackberry :)
