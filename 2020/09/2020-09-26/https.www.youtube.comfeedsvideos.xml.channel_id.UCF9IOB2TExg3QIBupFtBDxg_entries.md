CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

Changing Age Distribution of the COVID-19 Pandemic — United States, May–August 2020 (23rd September)

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6939e1-H.pdf

Early in the pandemic, COVID-19 incidence was highest among older adults 

June–August 2020

Incidence highest, 20–29 years

Accounted for less than 20% of all confirmed cases

Younger adults likely contribute to community transmission

Southern United States, June 2020

Increases in percentage of positive test results among adults aged 20–39

Increases among those aged more than 60 4–15 days later 

Therefore

Strict adherence to community mitigation strategies

Personal preventive behaviours by younger adults

Reduce infection and subsequent transmission to persons at higher risk for severe illness.

From 11:59pm 27 September, Melbourne has moved to the Second Step of easing restrictions.

Caregiving

Phased return for some education

Religious gatherings, outdoors, 6 people

As much as you can, you must stay at home

When you leave home, you must use a face mask

In 2 weeks if we hit an average of 5 cases rolling 14 day average, old mate Danny Andrews (our tireless Premier) has advised we can expect even more restrictions lifted than anticipated 6 weeks ago. (Christie)

Im getting lots of queries about how I record my videos, O do hope this helps, John

This method uses standard computer, video and microphone components. There is no need to spend a lot of money on a ‘dedicated’ studio system.

We're using a video camera pointing at a desk with a hdmi cable going into an elgato capture USB3 device - the HD 60 S.

The downward looking camera is mounted in a retort stand with a clamp, like in any chemistry lab.

Then the 2nd video is from a 1080p logitech Webcam. However, any video camera with do, use an HDMI to USB cable. Plug this into the HDMI out, in the camera.

Both devices are feeding into OBS (free software) before being recorded using the nvenc capabilities of a nvidia gtx 960 graphics card.

This is very similar to what the twitch.tv streamers are doing for their gaming sessions. 

The microphone is a usb "blue yeti" microphone, also gets recorded using OBS.

Of course less expensive microphones would also work.

Any editing (which I try to avoid as it takes ages) after this is done using Adobe premiere elements.
