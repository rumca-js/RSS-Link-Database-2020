Today we're learning from Stanley Kubrick about his thoughts on how to adapt novels into film, what it means to stay faithful to the original work, why actors are the missing tool for writers, and how to write theme into your stories. We focus on Stanley Kubrick's essay "Words and Movies" written a 1961 issue of Sight and Sound magazine.

Paring a novel into a two-hour film is a difficult task for even the best screenwriters and directors. Often the resulting movies are far removed from the novel, sometimes to the point of being unrecognizable. Stanley Kubrick's adaptations have consistently been among the best Hollywood has to offer, while still not being exact replicas of the works they're based on. Of the most popular of his films, The Shining has a notorious adaptation history. Stephen King was not a fan from the liberties that Kubrick took.
