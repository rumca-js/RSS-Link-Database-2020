Koei Tecmo held a 50-minute presentation at TGS 2020 showing off new gameplay and info for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, so we compiled some of the key details we learned that you may have missed.

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity was revealed just a few weeks ago and is coming out in November. Ahead of its release, Koei Tecmo held a live-stream during TGS 2020 to reveal some new information on the game, show off 13 minutes of brand new gameplay, and unveil Impa as a playable character.

But we uncovered some other info that may not have been as clear, such as details on how the Sheikah Slate might work between characters in gameplay, minor characters that might become playable, and how Age of Calamity connects to both Breath of the Wild and the original Hyrule Warriors.

Age of Calamity is both a spin-off and prequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and it’s set to release on November 20 exclusively for Nintendo Switch.

It’s time to see how Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s larger 12 v 12 game mode Combined Arms stacks up against Modern Warfare's 32 v 32 Ground War.  

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War released a surprise alpha on PS4 after it was announced at the PlayStation 5 Showcase. Being massive fans of Modern Warfare's big team battle mode, Ground War, we spent our time playing Cold War's Combined Arms mode. Although Combined Arms has 24 players versus Ground War's larger 64 player count, we found plenty of similarities and differences to talk about. Some of those include how the games handle their maps, spawning troubles, vehicle versus infantry balance, scorestreaks versus killstreaks, and what needs polish going into Cold War's final build. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes multiplayer mechanics away from the mil-sim and sandbox direction of Modern Warfare and towards earlier Black Ops gunfight fundamentals. Cold War is set in the 1980s with weapons themed around that time. Cold War had some larger maps in the alpha including a naval-based one called Armada and a frozen map called Crossroads. These maps contain a mix of gunboats, jet skis, tanks, and snowmobiles. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will not have a season pass but will have a Battle Pass system. Cold War supports cross-save, cross-play, and cross-generation play, and will tie into Call of Duty: Warzone.

Not only was Resident Evil 4 once a GameCube exclusive, it was also the final nail in the coffin for a legendary deal between Nintendo and Capcom.

In this episode of Remember When, Kurt Indovina looks back on the infamous Capcom Five deal, and the broken promise that left one of the gaming giants, and its fans, betrayed and heartbroken. To help Kurt on his journey, Nintendo historian Chris Scullion lends his professional insight on what the deal entailed, the impact it had on Nintendo, and its legacy.

## Baldur's Gate 1 + 2 Full Story Recap

Before the eventual release of Baldur's Gate 3, we thought it would be fun to go through the 1998 adventures of Gorion's Ward, Sarevok, Minsc, Volo and the rest of the gang from Baldur's Gate 1 + 2 as we recount the main stories of the base games, as well as the Siege of Dragonspear and Throne of Bhaal expansions.

With the October 6th release of Baldur's Gate 3 we are taking a look at the classic that started it all. The 1998 original Baldur's Gate, following the adventures of Imoen, Minsc and the rest of the companions that follow the player through Faerun, Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast. 

Baldur's Gate 3 will be revisiting much of the same locations and meeting the same enemies as the original game, namely the world of Avernus, The Flaming Fist and the Mind Flayers.

While the story seems very much separate, there's still plenty of lore and world building that new players to the franchise can learn right here, and take with them in their adventures in Baldur's Gate 3.

We're back with another deep dive into the world and history of Cyberpunk 2077 in this installment of our video lore series exploring everything you'll want and need to know ahead of the release of CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG. This week's episode, we're delving into the street gangs that operate throughout Night City.

In the video above, Jean-Luc Seipke talks about the main gangs that you'll have to worry about in Cyberpunk 2077. There are over 50 gangs in Night City, but only 10 will pose a serious threat to you. Those 10 will be more than enough, though, with each controlling and operating in a different part of the city.

In Cyberpunk 2077, you'll contend with Maelstrom, the Animals, 6th Street, Valentinos, the Tyger Claws, The Mox, the Voodoo Boys, the Scavengers, the Aldecaldos, and the Wraiths. Like we said before, there are a whole lot more, but we'll save the remaining minor gangs for another video down the line.

Cyberpunk 2077 will be released for Xbox One, PS4, and PC on November 19. The game is coming to Google Stadia sometime this year as well, and both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 next-gen ports are in the works too.
