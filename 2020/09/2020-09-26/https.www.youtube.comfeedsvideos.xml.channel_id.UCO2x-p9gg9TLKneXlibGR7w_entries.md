Quinn Nelson of Snazzy Labs talks about Modbook—a company started by an Apple Executive that had the support of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak for a number of years. What initially began as a success went down a path of failure and ultimately cost the company millions of dollars in losses with Kickstarter backers never receiving the product they ordered and the company in charge ghosting everyone involved.
