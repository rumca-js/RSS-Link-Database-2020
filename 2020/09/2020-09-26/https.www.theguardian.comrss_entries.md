## Why David Attenborough is the doomsayer we still adore | Rebecca Nicholson

<p>Ever eager to get the message out about climate crisis, the 94-year-old environmentalist joined Instagram last week</p><p>David Attenborough must be the only person who can appear on national television to tell us that we are all doomed, probably past the point of no return, that species are dying and the climate is boiling over and yet everybody still loves him. “Unfortunately, you’re all done for,” is what I took from his <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mn4n">programme</a> <em>Extinction: The Facts</em> on BBC One earlier this month; still, didn’t it feel nice to hear it from a national treasure?</p><p>Similarly, the words “this is my first time on Instagram” are not always a reason for optimism, but Attenborough <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidattenborough/">joined the platform</a> on Thursday, at the age of 94, and as a result he began trending on Twitter. (I have said it before, but when a certain name trends, it can provoke a brief moment of anxiety; in this case, it caused a sharp and thankfully unnecessary intake of breath.) In his first video, which is racking up likes more quickly than a picture of an egg, the presenter doubles down on his <em>Extinction</em> message, using a new platform to impress a sense of urgency to a presumably younger audience. “As we all know, the world is in trouble,” he explains, sombrely, promising to post more videos with suggestions of what we might do about it. It will all accompany his new film, <em>A Life on Our Planet</em>, in which he will dangle a glimpse of hope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/26/why-david-attenborough-is-the-doomsayer-we-still-adore">Continue reading...</a>

## So long, high heels. I have been too comfy, for too long, to go back

<p>For years, I was wedded to my stilettos and spikes. Now, who needs them? Give me plimsolls, brogues, loafers and flats</p><p>The last snap of my wedding night was taken at 2.30am, after a marathon disco reception. I’m walking the few minutes home for a nightcap, with a convoy of friends. I started the night wearing a green lamé frock and my “bridal” Mary Jane shoes: black, suede, ankle straps, pointed toes and a 3.5in spike heel. I called them, as most Manolo owners seem to, “the comfiest stilettos on Earth”. Relatively speaking, this was true. Nonetheless, the picture shows me hobbling up the hill in stockinged feet, champagne-stained shoes swinging from my fingers. I ached for a fortnight.</p><p>I wonder now if my poor hooves could do that again, having been mostly housebound for months. After a lifetime in vertiginous heels, have my feet spread, widening permanently, never to squeeze into a court shoe again? I may never find out. Since lockdown I have donated, sold and given away dozens of pairs of heels, and have no plans to buy more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/26/so-long-high-heels-i-have-been-too-comfy-for-too-long-to-go-back">Continue reading...</a>

Her 90s aesthetic is like all of the Spice Girls rolled into one, served with a side of irony. She even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UWb2aPBFvE">has a song about pizza</a>.</p><p>But she isn’t all style over substance. The 25-year-old, who was born in Argentina and grew up in Spain, is often compared to Spanish megastar Rosalía who blends R&amp;B and flamenco influences. Peluso’s lie more with neo-soul and hip-hop, while her 2018 EP <em>La Sandunguera</em> had a distinct jazz flavour. This year the singles have been steady: in February she released the plucky statement of intent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B614TAin4s">Business Wom</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B614TAin4s">an</a>, with its tense, Dr Dre-style beat, and in April, No Se Perdona, a feathery R&amp;B tune with another internet-famous rapper, Rels B.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/26/one-to-watch-nathy-peluso">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Alexandra Palace, London</strong><br />ENO’s bravura car park production overcame all kinds of logistical and artistic challenges, though couldn’t quite convey Puccini’s raw immediacy</p><p>Mimi’s sickbed is the floor of her transit van. Rodolfo sits hunched against a wheel outside, the closest he dare get to his dying lover. Musetta makes her showy arrival in a convertible Merc, and an old ice-cream van serves as the Cafe Momus. Trailer-trash stagings are nothing new – many an old camper van has been rolled on to an operatic stage – but here we’re in a proper car park, this unparalleled season’s venue of choice for high art.</p><p>From soloists to musicians to conductor to stage crew to car park attendants, all involved in English National Opera’s drive-in <em><a href="https://eno.org/whats-on/eno-drive-live/">La boh</a></em><a href="https://eno.org/whats-on/eno-drive-live/">è</a><em><a href="https://eno.org/whats-on/eno-drive-live/">me</a></em> deserve bravery awards. Surely this was the most physically exhausting and technically challenging production anyone has struggled to mount, made incalculably harder by social distancing. Man of the match goes to <a href="https://eno.org/artists/ian-dearden/">Ian Dearden</a>, the sound design wizard who has a long history with ENO, and who found a way to bring the whole enterprise alive. The orchestra played wonderfully, harp and woodwind sounding close enough to be sitting in your lap, which is certainly a first.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/26/la-boheme-eno-drive-in-live-alexandra-palace-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As his third novel is published, the television presenter talks about growing older, Eurovision and resuming his talk show in a pandemic</p><p>Graham Norton is chipper as we chat in West Cork, where he spends much of his time when his eponymous BBC TV show is not on air, and to which he has repaired during lockdown. Despite the disappointing weather – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/20/winds-of-more-than-70mph-expected-as-storm-ellen-chases-away-uk-summer">Storm Ellen</a> is about to wreak havoc on the west, and the following week will bring flooded roads and power outages across the area – and the daily waves of worse and worse news, he’s been quietly getting on with his other career, and the publication of his third novel, <em>Home Stretch</em>. “You know,” he says, “when I was rereading the proofs, it was in lockdown, Black Lives Matter and the world going to hell in a handcart, and I sort of thought, I’ve written an incredibly Pollyanna version of the world. But even if I have it’s a version of the world I like.”</p><p>It’s a lighthearted characterisation of his writing, but not entirely accurate. Although his novels are undoubtedly story-based, plot-driven and warmly entertaining – he described his first, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/oct/02/holding-graham-norton-review-debut-novel">Holding</a></em>, as a “yarn” – they are not without darkness. His second, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/23/a-keeper-graham-norton-review">A Keeper</a></em>, described the lengths that those in rural isolation will go to in the search for a partner, and <em>Home Stretch</em> is centred on the devastation visited on a small town after a fatal car crash. Beginning in 1987 and bringing us up to the present day, it focuses on an abiding theme of Irish life and literature – the relationship between those who remain and those who leave their families and communities – and also contains a vivid portrait of the evolution of gay life in Ireland.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/26/graham-norton-ireland-is-a-nation-of-leavers-i-am-in-awe-of-the-people-who-stayed-and-changed-minds">Continue reading...</a>

## No sign of peace at Barcelona as Messi simmers and Suárez says goodbye | Sid Lowe

<p>As their La Liga season starts on Sunday, the Camp Nou club are still in turmoil. Can playing matches lift the mood?</p><p>“It’s been a mad month; lots of things you would never have imagined happened,” Luis Suárez said and it wasn’t over yet – at least not for the men he was leaving behind. On Thursday afternoon, the Uruguayan sat at the Camp Nou, holding back the tears as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/23/luis-suarez-heading-for-atletico-madrid-on-free-after-wrangle-with-barcelona">he announced his departure</a> after six years and 198 goals. On Friday morning, two days before the start of their season, Lionel Messi turned up for training alone, the absence of his best friend hitting home and the Argentinian hitting out.</p><p>“I was already getting the idea into my head but today I walked into the dressing room and the penny dropped,” Barcelona’s captain wrote. “How hard it’s going to be to not share every day with you. It’s going to be strange to see you in a different shirt and even more so to play against you. You deserved to depart as what you are: one of the most important players in the club’s history. Not for them to kick you out like they did. But truth is, nothing surprises me any more.” It was exactly a month since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/25/lionel-messi-tells-barcelona-he-wants-to-leave-but-faces-legal-battle-over-clause">Messi </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/25/lionel-messi-tells-barcelona-he-wants-to-leave-but-faces-legal-battle-over-clause">had sent a burofax to the Camp Nou</a>, telling them he was leaving. Thirty-one days later, the man who wanted to go was still there and the man who wanted to stay had gone. As for the man Messi blames, the president, Josep Maria Bartomeu, he reached the end of the month still standing. All around him, though, the building is burning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/26/no-sign-of-peace-at-barcelona-as-messi-simmers-and-suarez-says-goodbye">Continue reading...</a>

On a beach holiday last year, I arrived with a suitcase full of black items: sundresses, bikinis and sarongs. It’s not that I wear black clothes solely, because I’ve tried desperately for decades to move towards colours and prints. But the truth is that every time I don’t wear black, it has been down to a deeply concerted effort not to. I reach for black first, always, and then rein myself in.</p><p>Each bold shade or floral print feels like a laboured nod towards behaving like a more everyday woman; someone who would roll into Zara and head straight for the terracotta shift frocks, or think nothing of slinging on a pastel dress, or a T-shirt with a slogan that gives away some of the thoughts in her head. This person might go to buy a winter coat and consider choosing a red one, or relish a wedding invite because it gives them a chance to splurge on a vivid frock.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/26/once-a-goth-always-a-goth-grace-dent-on-her-lifelong-love-affair-with-black">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You won’t need to keep your distance with these light and crumbly Italian hazelnut biscuits with a buttery, chocolate ganache filling</p><p>When I decided, some time ago, to write a recipe for these Italian <em>baci di dama</em>, or “lady’s kisses”, I didn’t imagine quite how unfashionable the suggestion of giving people kisses might become. But, of course, these are not real kisses: they are light, delicate and crumbly hazelnut biscuits sandwiching a buttery, chocolate ganache. And, right now, they are exactly what is needed: therapy to make and a sweet salve to share with those you live with.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/26/meera-sodha-recipe-italian-baci-chocolate-biscuits-new-vegan">Continue reading...</a>

When Tamarind first visits her Indian family’s Himalayan home, no one wants to talk about the mother she lost – but the wild garden hides an overgrown hut, and a mysterious girl. Could they hold the keys to her mother’s past? Bilan marries classic assurance to contemporary sensibility with a lush, gorgeous setting in a novel as vivid and original as her Costa-winning debut.</p><p>Sita Brahmachari’s <strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/when-secrets-set-sail-9781510105430.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article">When Secrets Set Sail</a></strong> (Orion) also interweaves past and present. Imtiaz has just joined Usha’s family – but Usha, mourning her grandmother Kali Ma, isn’t keen to welcome her adoptive sister. When Usha finds herself being haunted by Kali Ma, however, while Imtiaz is haunted by a mysterious woman called Lucky, they are drawn into the history of the Indian ayahs, or nannies, left abandoned in Britain.

<p>What makes great poetry? An exclusive extract from the late critic’s final book The Fire of Joy celebrates the poems he loved most</p><p>The French expression <em>feu de joie </em>refers to a military celebration when all the riflemen of a regiment fire one shot after another, in close succession: ideally the sound should be continuous, like a drumroll. I first saw a <em>feu de joie </em>performed at an Australian army tattoo, in the main arena at the Sydney Showground, while I was still in short trousers. Later on, when I was doing national service in longer trousers, I saw the ceremony performed again, on the parade ground in Ingleburn, New South Wales, in 1958. Symbolically, the fire of joy is a reminder that the regiment’s collective power relies on the individual, and vice versa.</p><p>Imprinted on my mind, the succession of explosions became an evocation of the heritage of English poets and poetry, from Chaucer onwards. It still strikes me as a handy metaphor for the poetic succession, especially because, in the <em>feu de joie</em>, nobody got hurt. It was all noise: and noise, I believe, is the first and last thing that poetry is. If a poem doesn’t sound compel­ling, it won’t continue to exist. This is an especially important thing to say in the present era, when the pseudo-modernist idea still persists that there might be something sufficiently fascinat­ing about the way that words are arranged on the page.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/26/clive-james-the-poems-i-remember-are-the-milestones-marking-the-journey-of-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What I’ve learned about long-term Covid-19 has forced me to mentally reframe the risk factors and the way the future could play out</p><p>Five months ago, I <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/02/clapping-nhs-all-very-well-my-sister-on-the-frontline" title="">wrote about my sister</a>, a junior doctor at a large hospital, and my fears for her as she worked on what is frequently described as “the frontline” of the Covid-19 crisis, as if she were a soldier at war, as opposed to someone who just wanted to make people feel better.</p><p>Well, grab me a turban and call me Mystic Meg, because you’ll never guess what happened next. She got coronavirus. Pretty badly, actually, since you ask, around the end of March. While death is obviously the worst possible outcome of Covid-19, there are, it is increasingly clear, other bad ones. My sister is now suffering from long-term Covid, known to doctors like her as “<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3026" title="">post-acute</a> <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3026" title="">Covid-19</a>”. According to the British Medical Journal, about 10% of people who are infected still feel the effects <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3026" title="">more than three weeks later</a>. In my sister’s case, it’s been six months. When she first got sick and tried to maintain that always-encouraged attitude – positivity – she would think ahead to the autumn, being back at work in the hospital, going for long cycle rides. Instead, she can’t walk to the end of her road without becoming breathless. It doesn’t improve. It just is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/26/i-used-to-be-ms-covid-casual-but-with-a-sick-sister-thats-changed">Continue reading...</a>

This is the special online quasi-threequel to the first two feelgood movies, written and directed by Nancy Meyers, and based on the original 1950 film with Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.</p><p>The answer to Matty’s question is of course yes. They are super-schmaltzy.

<p>Tottenham midfielder’s talent shone brightly against Real Madrid three years ago – but when Mourinho starts calling you talented you need to worry</p><p>Last year Sport England announced it would be spending £85m on <a href="https://www.sportengland.org/news/talent-plan-for-england-launched" title="">The Talent Plan For England</a>. The idea behind the Talent Plan is to create “the world’s best talent plan” – a shoot-for-the-moon ambition that becomes more achievable if you accept the rather pedantic objection that a Talent Plan is something you’ve just made up, and thus, technically, nobody else in the world has one anyway.</p><p>What is certain is that the Talent Plan has a lot to say about talent, so much that its 35-page outline mentions it 258 times in total. This is the big takeaway from the Talent Plan: talent is definitely very important. To be clear, nobody here is suggesting we don’t care about talent. It is a doubly interesting read given one unarguable truth about talent is that nobody seems to know exactly how it works. It has even become fashionable in coaching circles to say talent is overrated, that it is a kind of chimera.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/sep/26/dele-alli-jose-mourinnho-tottenham-talent-real-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

The musician and actor is on the phone from her home in Los Angeles, where for the last six months she has been sitting out lockdown. Monáe’s music career is dominated by sci-fi imagery, thrilling story arcs and inventiveness of a kind that has earned her comparisons to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/prince" title="">Prince</a>, with whom she worked and could go toe-to-toe, not only on talent but also outlandish wardrobe decisions. The voice on the line, by contrast, is quiet, serious and devoid of all whimsy. She’s also terrifically earnest. To give an idea: Monáe is 34 but, asked to confirm her age, she says with what sounds like complete sincerity: “I’m timeless.”</p><p>She isn’t wrong, in a way; there is something about Monáe’s work that defies time and space, from her iconic first EP in 2007, Metropolis – in which she introduced her robotic alter ego, Cindi Mayweather, a character she used over the course of three albums to explore what happens when you break from convention – to the iconic 2018 feminist anthem <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/16/why-janelle-monaes-vagina-pants-make-me-cheer" title="">Pynk</a>, to her collaborations with everyone from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/steviewonder" title="">Stevie Wonder</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/grimes" title="">Grimes</a>.

First, I checked the <a href="https://www.smidgeup.com/midge-forecast/">midge forecast</a>. Some west coast areas on the Scottish mainland were showing maximum, but the Outer Hebrides looked less hostile. I ordered two top-quality head nets and wondered who to take along. Second, I got hold of the OS Explorer maps for my planned route and spent hours scouring them for potential wild camps. Finally, I rang Ray Mears. He’s got a new book out on <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/wilderness-chef-9781844865833/">wilderness cookery</a> and was clearly the man to ask. “Take a frying pan, butter, flour and fisherman’s salt,” he advised. “They’ll be good for any mackerel you catch. Forage juniper berries, bilberries, heather tea, chanterelle mushrooms and possibly <a href="https://www.wildfooduk.com/mushroom-guide/brown-birch-bolete/">birch boletes</a>.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/sep/26/miles-and-isles-our-big-scottish-bike-ride">Continue reading...</a>
