An exclusive extract from the late critic\u2019s final book The Fire of Joy celebrates the poems he loved most</p><p>The French expression <em>feu de joie </em>refers to a military celebration when all the riflemen of a regiment fire one shot after another, in close succession: ideally the sound should be continuous, like a drumroll. I first saw a <em>feu de joie </em>performed at an Australian army tattoo, in the main arena at the Sydney Showground, while I was still in short trousers. Later on, when I was doing national service in longer trousers, I saw the ceremony performed again, on the parade ground in Ingleburn, New South Wales, in 1958. Symbolically, the fire of joy is a reminder that the regiment\u2019s collective power relies on the individual, and vice versa.</p><p>Imprinted on my mind, the succession of explosions became an evocation of the heritage of English poets and poetry, from Chaucer onwards. It still strikes me as a handy metaphor for the poetic succession, especially because, in the <em>feu de joie</em>, nobody got hurt. It was all noise: and noise, I believe, is the first and last thing that poetry is. If a poem doesn\u2019t sound compel\u00adling, it won\u2019t continue to exist. This is an especially important thing to say in the present era, when the pseudo-modernist idea still persists that there might be something sufficiently fascinat\u00ading about the way that words are arranged on the page.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/26/clive-james-the-poems-i-remember-are-the-milestones-marking-the-journey-of-my-life\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/26/clive-james-the-poems-i-remember-are-the-milestones-marking-the-journey-of-my-life", "date_published": "2020-09-26 08:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Help!
