The top 10 causes of death

https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/the-top-10-causes-of-death

56.9 million deaths worldwide in 2016

54% were due to the top 10 causes

University of Washington School of Medicine

Rigorous and comparable measurement, world’s health problems, evaluates strategies

Global Review

Cases are remaining constant

250,000 per day since August

Approximately one infection in 10 has been detected globally to date 

31, 483,001 = 314, 830, 010

Assuming 1,000,000 deaths

IFR = 0.32

Daily deaths are decline

Just over 5,000 a day in the last week 

Making COVID-19 the sixth-leading cause of global mortality

Progress in Latin America except Argentina

Surging cases in Europe

Continued epidemic expansion in India

Expect 

Decreasing vigilance of the public in many countries

Northern Hemisphere seasonality will lead to a major global surge in daily cases

Deaths increasing late November and December. 

Projections

30,000 deaths a day in December

January 1, 2021, total deaths, 2,667,497

Fourth leading cause of death

Herd immunity strategy

Up to 70% of individuals can get infected in a situation of near-random mixing 

Actual percentage probably less

No further government action when the winter surge begins in the Northern Hemisphere

Deaths by January 1, a total of 3,618,640. 

Mask use can save more than 730,000 lives by January 1

43% of the deaths expected between now and the end of 2020

More on herd immunity

Multiple locations in Latin America are now at over 40%

Ecuador and Mexico City

Indicating percentages increase to at least these levels

With herd immunity at 40% cumulative infection

Highly optimistic

Less than one quarter through the epidemic on January 1

10.4 million deaths

With herd immunity at 50% cumulative infection

13.1 million deaths

Only if we end the pandemic everywhere can we end the pandemic anywhere.

Having flu and Covid-19 together

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/22/flu-and-covid-19-at-same-time-significantly-increases-risk-of-death#img-1

Prof Jonathan Van-Tam 

Significantly increases risk of death

Double whammy

n = 58 people 

UK, early phase of the pandemic.

Hospitalised

Tested for both viruses

Very ill

Coinfection, deaths, 43%

COVID only, deaths, 26.9%

If you do think you have either flu or Co Vi D stay at home and self-isolate

30, 000, 000 doses of flu vac

50-64 will be offered flu vaccination

Children 2 – 11

Essential workers

## Follow the science and evidence

No community spread for over 5 months

Strict border controls

Secured hotel quarantine for 14 days

catching a few positive cases every week, but not getting into the community

Never had strict broad lockdowns, although early on we did have pubs, clubs, massage parlours, etc closed and many people working from home.

Have and still are using social distancing in shops, but no masks

To make it clear that the virus is airborne

Once said the virus is only spread by coughs and sneezes, less than six feet 

Infection, breathing, infected particles can travel further than six feet

WHO

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions

https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions

Respiratory droplets bigger than 5 - 10 μm

Smaller than 5μm, droplet nuclei or aerosols

Respiratory droplet transmission, within 1 metre

of an infected person who has respiratory symptoms

Aerosol-generating procedures

To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated

Talking about cluster evidence

However, the detailed investigations of these clusters suggest that droplet and fomite transmission could also explain human-to-human transmission within these clusters.

Counter argument

Airborne transmission of covid-19

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3206

Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, research in aerobiology, physics, and computational fluid dynamics has advanced our understanding of aerosol generation and the carriage and fate of respiratory particles

239 scientists signed an open letter appealing to the medical community and relevant national and international bodies to recognise the potential for airborne spread of covid-19

Cases, 5, 562, 662

Deaths 88, 935

Health system overwhelmed

Chaos in places

Shortage of medical staff and equipment

Government hospitals at capacity

Delhi 

Orders 33 private hospitals to reserve 80% of ICU beds

Cases, 230,000

Cases, + 4,000 for past eight days

No ICU beds in eight of 11 top private hospitals

Many patients are unable to find a place in hospitals
 
Mumbai

Third of normal hospital beds still unoccupied

Hospitals busy, ICU scarce

Indian government

Reopened gyms, most workplaces, markets, bars

Cinemas closed

Schools and colleges now reopening

Death tole likely to spine in next few weeks

Distance among children

Up to 12, do not have to stay 1.5 metres apart from each other or from adults

17 and younger, do not have to stay 1.5 metres apart from each other

Source and contact tracing, testing and staying home

COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath or coughing, stay at home until the symptoms have been gone for 24 hours

Children do not need to be tested, unless they are seriously ill

Preventing the virus from spreading in childcare facilities and schools

Hygiene, hands and frequent touch points, respiratory 

Ventilation and airing out indoor spaces

It is important to properly ventilate homes, businesses and other buildings, such as schools

Face masks and gloves

https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/face-masks-and-gloves

The literature does not offer a clear consensus on the effect of wearing non-medical face masks in public spaces

It seems likely that face masks help prevent infecting others, but only to a limited extent

If everyone follows the basic rules, it is not necessary to wear a face mask

OMT is not issuing a general recommendation to wear face masks in public spaces
