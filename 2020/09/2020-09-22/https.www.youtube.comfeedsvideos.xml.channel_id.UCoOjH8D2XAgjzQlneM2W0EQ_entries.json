To solve these problems, one of the options you can use is diplomacy. However, sometimes diplomacy just won\u2019t cut it. Whatever the reason is, if diplomacy doesn\u2019t work. The President\u2019s third option, or tertia optio as it\u2019s called behind closed doors.\n\nCovert action can be a whole range of things - from drone strikes, to sabotage, to paramilitary operations, snatch and grabs, to funding and training rebels around the world that oppose our enemies.\n\nLet\u2019s learn how you as the President and the CIA can protect the free world, with your third option\n\nThe first thing to understand is this is the most extreme measure that should only be used when you\u2019ve tried every other option. The next step is to stop calling it by you know what! The final decision to \u201celiminate\u201d someone should always be reached in the field where the \u201cneutralization\u201d will be taking place. Once the decision has been reached, how you\u2019re gonna \u201cpreemptively neutralize\u201d someone is gonna vary largely based on the situation.\n\nThe best \u201clethal direct actions,\u201d are the ones that aren\u2019t even considered neutralizations in the first place. There are a few different variables we have to account for - the awareness of the subject, the desired outcome of our guy, and concealment. So now that you sorted out the different variables, let\u2019s move onto the neutralizer itself.\n\nSelecting your neutralizer will be based on whether it\u2019s a safe or lost job. For a lost case, the hitman needs to be a genuine fanatic of some sort. If you intend for your neutralizer to escape, the CIA typically recruits former Special Forces operators because they\u2019re pretty much the perfect candidates. And once you have your neutralizer or neutralizers, it\u2019s time to plan out that preemptive neutralization.\n\nThe entire point of neutralization is the absolute death of the subject! Blunt objects come in handy since you\u2019ll be able to find one where the target is and it\u2019s less likely to scream \u201cthis was a professional job!\u201d  For secret cases like that where you don\u2019t want people knowing it was a hit, accidents are your best bet.\n\nNow you know the origin of these covert action operations. It\u2019s time to get out there, and get to work. \n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
