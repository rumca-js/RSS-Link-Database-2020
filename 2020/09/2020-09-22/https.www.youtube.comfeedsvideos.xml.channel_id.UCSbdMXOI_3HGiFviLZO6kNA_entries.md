Hello and welcome to TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. 

So Facebook connect has happened, the Oculus Quest 2 has been announced officially, a ton of new games were announced, and AR has taken a step further towards commercialization. Today however I am focusing on the Quest 2, because really, now the Rift platform is dead, Facebook rules VR, but we have an awesome cheap VR headset that will get millions of new VR users. Its the best and worst thing to ever happen to the industry.
