Ibeyi comprise a m\u00e9lange of cultures. Sisters Lisa-Kaind\u00e9 Diaz and Naomi Diaz perform music with African and Cuban influences. They take their name \"Ibeyi\" from a Yoruba word meaning \"twins.\" They sing English lyrics with vocal stylings reminiscent of American or British soul music. And when they chat with one another, they do so in French, the natural language of Paris, the city where they were raised and where they reside to this day. Watch one performance by Ibeyi from their 2015 session, plus two more from a 2018 episode of \"Live From Here,\" recorded at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul. \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Mama Says\" (2015)\n4:00 \"Away Away\" (2018)\n7:14 \"River\" (2018)\n\nPERSONNEL\nLisa-Kaind\u00e9 Diaz \u2013 keys, vocals\nNaomi Diaz \u2013 percussion, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Tom Coughlin; Sam Hudson\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Jeffy Hnilicka\n\nFIND MORE:\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/09/22/ibeyi-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2018 Live From Here episode: https://www.livefromhere.org/shows/2018/02/24/dr-dog-ibeyi-dan-naturman\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#ibeyi", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi7kkwDI12w", "date_published": "2020-09-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Andrea Swensson interviews BrownMark of the Revolution", "description": "BrownMark, bass player for the Revolution, is the author of a new memoir titled \"My Life in the Purple Kingdom.\" Local Show host Andrea Swensson interviewed the artist about the book, his relationship with Prince, and his reflections on the need for racial justice.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uSycowYgWA", "date_published": "2020-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Ron Gallo - Virtual Session", "description": "Songs Played:\n02:16 Wunday (Crazy After Dark)\n04:55 Easter Island\n17:45 Hide Myself\n21:06 All The Punks Are Domesticated (2020 Version)\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent\n\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPQZWGmJ12A", "date_published": "2020-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Semisonic - three songs at The Current (2019)", "description": "On Friday, Sept. 18, Semisonic released the new EP \"You're Not Alone.\" That reminded us how last July, Semisonic visited our studio to play three as-yet unreleased songs that are out now on the new release, including the song that is the title track.
