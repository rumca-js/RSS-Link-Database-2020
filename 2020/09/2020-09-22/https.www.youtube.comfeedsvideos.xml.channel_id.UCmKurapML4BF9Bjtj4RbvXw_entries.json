That was what Beethoven\u2019s publisher called the Sonata No. 8. The title stuck: \u201cSonata Path\u00e9tique.\u201d\n\nSo was Beethoven\u2019s publisher totally trolling him?\n\nThere are two distinct meanings of this word: \u201cPathetic,\u201d meaning pitiful and worthless; and  \u201cPath\u00e9tique\u201d -- meaning deeply meaningful and with feeling. I think you\u2019ll agree, upon hearing Beethoven's masterpiece, that his publisher was referring to the second. (Hear the sonata\u2019s Adagio Cantabile here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuN3yCmHb_U -- then comment on where you can hear it in our arrangement.)\n\nPathetic and Path\u00e9tique.\n\nThis is, perhaps, the same distinction Lauren Daigle (who we LOVE) sings about in her masterful tune, \u201cYou Say.\u201d\n\nThe world may say you\u2019re pathetic, pitiful and worthless. Or worse, you may even say this about yourself.\n\nBut there is another voice that says you\u2019re Path\u00e9tique -- deeply meaningful and worth every feeling.\n\nWhose voice is that? It could be a mentor, a trusted friend, a family member. It could be the RIGHT voice in your head that doesn\u2019t get enough air time. It could be a God that loves you with deep meaning and feeling -- with an endless and infinite love that is powerful and never pathetic -- an encircling love that doesn\u2019t pull away, but holds you even closer when you fall short.\n\nHere\u2019s what Lauren had to SAY:\n\n\u201cWhen I wrote You Say...I felt like so many things were pulling me in so many different directions. I think a lot of times we build these complexes based on insecurity, based on fear, based on rejection, and lies that we have to constantly overcome. And so this song for me was just a reminder of identity. It was a reminder that I know when I\u2019m weak, He\u2019s strong\u2014so how do I change that and bring that into my everyday life? When I feel inadequate how is it that there\u2019s always these moments where I feel like God just steps in and supersedes my inadequacies. This entire song was so every single day I would get up on stage and remind myself\u2014no, this is the truth, this is the truth, this is the truth. Don\u2019t get buried in confusion. Don\u2019t get buried in waywardness. Just remember to steady the course, steady the course.\u201d\n\nNow here\u2019s what Beethoven had to SAY:\n\n\u201cO, you men who think or say that I am malevolent, stubborn or misanthropic, how greatly do you wrong me. You do not know the secret cause which makes me seem that way to you, and I would have ended my life - it was only my art that held me back. Ah, it seemed impossible to leave the world until I had brought forth all that I felt was within me.\u201d\n\nWe think these songs were meant to be together. And perhaps there\u2019s something to this, because only after we paired them, we discovered that Beethoven was 27 years old when he composed the Path\u00e9tique. Guess how old Ms. Daigle was when she wrote \u201cYou Say?\u201d \n\nYou guessed it. 27. \n\nAs you listen to this, we hope it helps you silence the \u201cpathetic\u201d naysayer in you and embrace the \u201cPath\u00e9tique\u201d yeasayer that has always been with you. The one that wants you to stay. To get back up. To keep striving. To keep creating. To NOT leave this world until you have brought forth your art. ALL that is within you.\n\n\u25ba Read more of the story here: https://smarturl.it/yousaystory\n\nWe\u2019re so grateful you\u2019re here watching this video.
