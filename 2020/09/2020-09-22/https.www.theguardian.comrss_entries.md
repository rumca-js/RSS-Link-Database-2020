<p>On 23 September 1970 nine women decided they had seen enough misogyny in tennis and broke away to play their own tournament, sowing the seeds for today’s WTA<br /></p><p>If Kristy Pigeon’s father had had his way, she certainly would not have been a tennis player. She would have spent her youth as a cheerleader with ample angora sweatshirts and then in college her priority would have been the pursuit of her future husband, of her future breadwinner.</p><p>“That’s just another indication of how men viewed women back 50 years ago,” Pigeon says in a phone interview. “I was teased when I would jog and be training for tennis. In high school ... people thought it was not very attractive for women to want to pursue a sport.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/23/they-wont-buy-tickets-to-see-women-50-years-on-from-a-tennis-rebellion">Continue reading...</a>

## The Great British Bake Off review – was this the silliest showstopper yet?

<p>Although preparations were severely hampered by the pandemic, Bake Off remains a delight – even if no one needed to see Freddie Mercury and Bob Marley immortalised in sponge</p><p>What a week for The Great British Bake Off (Channel 4) to return. I am not sure there could have been a more appropriate time for this cosiest of television shows to come back, bringing with it the promise of a weekly distraction in the form of cake, bread and 12 decent people supporting each other through thick and thin batter. Until there is another panicked run on flour, eggs and yeast, that is, and we are left trying to join in with bread week using a three-year-old bag of tapioca flour and some out-of-date spices that may or may not have any flavour left in them, depending on which way you sniff them.</p><p>In some ways, this series is far from business as usual. Filming was delayed by the pandemic; when it eventually began, the tent had moved to a new location and the bakers and presenters had formed a superbubble. Sandi Toksvig has gone, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/11/matt-lucas-to-host-the-great-british-bake-off">replaced by Matt Lucas</a>. At first, Lucas wears the look of a competition winner getting his lifelong wish of a tour of the tent. He looks genuinely thrilled to be there and a little overwhelmed. There is a bit of tentative newness at the start – “Are you a fan of battenberg?” he asks more than one baker, during the battenberg challenge – but he settles in quickly. Soon, it is as if he has always been there. It helps that he and Noel Fielding are friends; their rapport is lovely to watch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/22/the-great-british-bake-off-review-was-this-the-silliest-showstopper-yet">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is anger that sports have jumped through hoops to make stadiums safe yet track and trace is still so ineffective </p><p>After a kick in the teeth, a kiss of life? Sports bodies were left blindsided and woozy by the announcement on Tuesday that the return of crowds to stadiums would not only be “paused” but could be delayed until 1 April. Then came a slither of hope with the news that up to eight elite sports are now likely to be helped by a rescue package. The question now is how deep is the government’s pockets – and will the money really be enough?</p><p>Make no mistake: this is a crisis so menacing it should come accompanied by the soundtrack to Jaws. How can it not be when the Premier League is warning that football is losing £100m a month?

## The British government is preparing to break the law again – this time on torture | Shami Chakrabarti

<p>A new bill plans to ignore conventions protecting both military personnel and civilians in overseas operations</p><p>A week ago, the government showed its brazen willingness to violate international law in relation to the EU <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/06/five-weeks-clinch-brexit-deal-uk-move-boris-johnson-to-say">withdrawal agreement</a>. So it should be no surprise that it now wishes to ignore the UN convention against torture and the European convention on human rights (ECHR). Last week the villains were those wicked Europeans; today it is activist lawyers and human rights, which are said to hamper rather than inspire the military overseas. Last week, the not-so-hidden <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/05/desperate-boris-johnson-to-step-up-personal-attacks-on-keir-starmer">jibe</a> was against Sir Keir Starmer as a “remainer lawyer”. This time no doubt, the prod is against the Labour leader as a former director of public prosecutions.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/aug/25/labour-calls-for-halt-of-bill-shielding-uk-soldiers-from-prosecution">overseas operations bill</a> arrives in the House of Commons for its second reading on Wednesday. It <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/overseas-operations-bill-uk-government-bend-rules-torture-soldiers">severely restricts</a> the ability to prosecute serious criminal wrongdoing by overseas personnel by installing a presumption against doing so after five years. It also requires the attorney general’s consent for any such prosecution. Anyone who has lived through the war on terror will know that we could reasonably face a scenario in which a victim of torture is detained in a legal black hole for far longer than it might take to pursue a crime against them. Further, the law officer who must consent to any prosecution may well have been the person responsible for authorising the operation now being impugned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/22/government-break-law-torture-bill-military-personnel-civilians-overseas-operations">Continue reading...</a>

## Supernova review – Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci dazzle as a couple facing their fears

<p>The veteran pair are on magnificent form in a drama about love and mortality that is all the more powerful for its restraint</p><p>Lovely, heartfelt performances from Stanley Tucci and Colin Firth carry this intimate movie from actor-turned-film-maker Harry Macqueen, whose 2014 debut, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/feb/26/hinterland-review">Hinterland</a>, was also a two-hander about love. Tucci and Firth play Tusker and Sam, a couple who have been together for decades: Tusker is a respected novelist and Sam a musician. (Firth gives his own perfectly serviceable piano performance of Elgar’s Salut d’Amour, all the more of a lump-in-the-throat moment for its unflashiness.) The careers of both have been put on hold because Tusker has been diagnosed with early-onset dementia.</p><p>The couple have decided to take their camper van for a trip north, to drop in on Sam’s sister and her family, to have some alone time together and, perhaps, to come to terms with the fact that this holiday may be their last together while Tusker is still well. He is still working on a new book but is increasingly preoccupied with astronomy, gazing into the night skies, perhaps soothed by the unimaginable vastness of space, in comparison with which his problems are nothing. Is this new hobby therapeutic, or something that is accelerating his slide into enigmatic blankness?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/22/supernova-review-colin-firth-stanley-tucci-toronto">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Fiery, chaotic and full of emotion': This Heat, the band who tried to change everything

<p>They rehearsed in a former meat pie factory, drawing on claustrophobic 80s London to make violently anxious music – but This Heat, finally available to stream, talk about how they wanted to appeal to everyone</p><p>Over lockdown, says Charles Hayward, he found his thoughts turning to This Heat, the wildly influential band he played in 40 years ago. It wasn’t the Covid-fuelled atmosphere of dread and paranoia that did it, although plenty of people heard dread and paranoia in the music This Heat made between 1977 – when the wider world first became aware of the extraordinary sound made by Hayward and fellow members Charles Bullen and the late Gareth Williams thanks to a John Peel session – and 1982, when they split after their second album, Deceit. It was what he calls “the grain of sound” on TV at the moment.</p><p>“Because everyone’s doing everything from home, production values have become very interchangeable – sometimes a show can go from one sort of technological texture to another, and people aren’t batting an eyelid. You’re listening to the news, or a comedy programme and it’s jumping from one sort of grain to the other, one acoustic to another and you’re making your own connections. That is what This Heat records are.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/22/fiery-chaotic-and-full-of-emotion-this-heat-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Through fantastical environments where buildings and oversized monuments are made of rubber sandals and toothpaste tubes, Studio Oleomingus – made up of writer/artist Dhruv Jani and programmer Sushant Chakraborty, with help from another programmer, Vivek Savsaiya – crafts interactive stories that cast a playful light on India’s complicated past and present.</p><p>“We find video games to be excellent spaces for political discourse,” Jani tells me over Skype. “The government is hardly bothered about something as ‘trivial’ as video games, and they also give you a lot of room to think and ponder complex ideas.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/22/video-games-india-politics-dhruv-jani-sushant-chakraborty-studio-oleomingus">Continue reading...</a>

## Jamaican director of UCL's slavery research centre: British racism is 'clear and sharp'

<p>The UK continues the fiction that racial exploitation is in the past, says Matthew Smith. He hopes his London appointment will help change that</p><p>Matthew Smith did not plan to quit Jamaica. Until last year the historian, who previously headed the history and archaeology department of the University of the West Indies at Mona, near Kingston, had made a point of staying. “I wanted my career to be an example that you don’t have to leave,” he explains on a video call. But when the directorship of UCL’s <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/">Centre for the Study of the Legacies of British Slave-</a><a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/">ownership</a> came up, he couldn’t resist. “I couldn’t think of a better job,” he says. “For me it was the perfect way to bridge research on the Caribbean with meaningful public engagement.”</p><p>Smith, 46, takes over the reins of the centre at an extraordinary time.

<p>In casting waif-like Liu Yifei in its live-action remake, Disney squandered its chance to show a Chinese audience that girls can be both beautiful and tough</p><p>As a child who grew up in China with little exposure to Disney until I was eight, the idea of a princess marrying a prince and living happily ever after was something entirely foreign. I was more familiar with the fox and snake spirits in Chinese folklore that transformed into beautiful women and sorceresses, and the cross-dressing heroines of <em>wuxia</em> martial-arts TV shows of the 90s.</p><p>It’s no surprise, then, that Disney’s 1998 film Mulan was more relatable than Sleeping Beauty. Mulan was not only Chinese but had a mission greater than marriage – to save her father and country – and she didn’t need saving herself. For Disney, she was the first “non-princess” who did not end up marrying a prince. It was a mortal’s story: there were no spells or supernatural forces to help her fight her battles, and she did not levitate off rooftops like the wuxia women. Her only celestial remedy was a plump, cheering squad of ancestor spirits and a funny little serpent called Mushu.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/22/mulan-why-it-was-a-missed-opportunity-to-create-a-strong-asian-woman-on-screen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He is happy to talk about the situation – and I don’t wish to make him anxious – but is there anything I can do to improve things?</p><p><strong>My 70-year-old loving partner of </strong><strong>eight months is unable to ejaculate despite my </strong><strong>best efforts</strong><strong>. He’s unable to hold his erection for long, and thus we have been unable to consummate our relationship. Despite this, we have a pretty fulfilling sex life, as we are </strong><strong>still very interested in each other and he’s extremely considerate to my needs, which gives him great pleasure. I would very much wish to reciprocate. We are able to talk, although I do not labour the point, </strong><strong>because I do not wish to make him anxious as this would only exacerbate the situation. He tells me he has been on medication for clinical depression in the past, and may need to resort to that again</strong><strong> if he needs it. He also has type 2 </strong><strong>diabetes for which he takes medication. I believe he talked to his </strong><strong>GP about</strong><strong> Viagra, but it was not recommended. Is there anything we could do to improve the situation</strong><strong>? I am not expecting miracles</strong><strong> – we are nevertheless enjoying a wonderful late loving relationship</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, many types of medication can lead to problems with sexual desire, arousal or orgasm, including medications for diabetes and depression. The good news is that physicians are often able to help a patient who is experiencing sexual side-effects to switch medication to another that suits him better. Your partner should consult his physician, and not allow himself to be discouraged or put off. Sometimes, the need for sexual proficiency by a septuagenarian is not as well respected as it should be. He must be clear that sex is important to him and you – and insist on having attention paid to his sexual needs. Having said that – as you have thankfully discovered – good sex and thrilling eroticism do not rely on the penile mechanics. And as you also know, it would be unwise to put undue pressure on him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/22/my-partner-cant-stay-erect-long-enough-for-us-to-consummate-our-relationship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A retirement village in Kent and 50s Catalonia provide the backdrops for two popular TV hosts’ very different debut novels </p><p>In a recent YouGov survey concerning British TV celebrities, Richard Osman emerged as the ninth most popular telly personality – the words most often used to describe him were “likable, clever, quick-witted and charming”. Fans of Osman were, the survey suggested, most likely also to admire Dawn French, Judi Dench and appliances made by Russell Hobbs. All of which data no doubt helps to make Viking Penguin, the publisher of Osman’s first novel, comfortable with its decision to invest a “seven-figure advance” in a two-book deal, safe in the knowledge that the <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/25/jump-the-shark-pointless">Pointless</a></em> co-presenter is well on the way to national treasure status.</p><p><em>The Thursday Murder Club</em> might double as a final application for that accolade. The club of the book’s title meets every week in the jigsaw room at Coopers Chase, a superior gated retirement village in rural Kent; the puzzle the members attempt to solve, however, is not the “two thousand piecer of Whitstable harbour” left unfinished on the coffee table, but rather one of several cold murder cases brought to their attention by Penny, a resident in the village and a former police inspector. What follows threatens to become the Famous Five in <em>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</em>, or a Midsomer murder for a whole gang of Miss Marples. Could there be a more seductive pitch to the readers of middle England (or to the producers of Sunday evening drama)?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/22/the-thursday-club-by-richard-osman-the-diver-and-the-lover-by-jeremy-vine-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A joke in the tearoom at work led to a shocking discovery that challenged my entire identity, writes <strong>Fiona Darroch</strong>, but slowly I have made peace with it</p><p>I was born in Durban, South Africa, in November 1962. My parents tried for a baby for more than five years before hearing about Dr Walker and his miracle babies. They were always a bit vague when explaining how he had helped Mum to conceive but clearly held him in high esteem, so much so that he became my godfather.</p><p>My brother arrived two years later, and my younger sister was born just before my sixth birthday. We had a very happy childhood and my godfather, Tony, and his wife, Molly, played a big part in our lives. He and I became close after our family moved to Cape Town. We sent letters to one another and he visited often. My mother typed his novels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/22/learning-that-a-fertility-doctor-was-my-biological-father-was-painful-but-on-the-upside-i-have-hundreds-of-new-siblings">Continue reading...</a>

But after Europe cracked down on migration, its crew found themselves facing prosecution</p><p>As patrol boats with flashing blue lights surrounded the Iuventa, just outside the port of Lampedusa on the evening of 1 August 2017, its crew were more annoyed than alarmed. For three days, the old fishing trawler, crewed by volunteers from the German NGO <em>Jugend Rettet</em> (Youth Rescue), had answered a string of requests from the Italian coastguard that to them made no sense. “This madness hopefully will soon be over,” read a message sent from the ship’s bridge to Jugend Rettet base camp shortly after 10pm.</p><p>In the summer of 2017, two years on from the peak of Europe’s refugee crisis, smugglers in Libya were still sending hundreds of people a day to sea in unsafe rubber boats, and the Iuventa’s crew wanted to be where the action was. In a patch of sea just off the coast of north Africa, about a dozen NGO ships were searching for boats in distress – a direct challenge, as many of them saw it, to European governments that had scaled back state-run rescue efforts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/22/how-rescuing-drowning-migrants-became-a-crime-iuventa-salvini-italy">Continue reading...</a>

## The fight over dyslexia - podcast

<p>The question of who gets diagnosed with dyslexia and who then receives support was one of many that Guardian journalist Sirin Kale found herself examining when she began a year-long investigation into the condition. But what surprised her most was how fiery the conversation around this condition had become, with some asking whether the term dyslexia should even exist</p><p>Most people in the UK will learn to read and write by the age of seven, but about 20% of the population will struggle to reach this level, and about half of these people are believed to be dyslexic, although not all of them will be diagnosed. Guardian journalist <strong>Sirin Kale</strong> tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about investigating questions around dyslexia - the science behind it, how people are diagnosed, who is diagnosed and what treatments work. </p><p>A 2019 <a href="https://cdn.bdadyslexia.org.uk/documents/Final-APPG-for-Human-cost-of-dyslexia-appg-report.pdf">report from</a> the all-party parliamentary group for dyslexia found that children from lower income backgrounds were less likely to be diagnosed with dyslexia. As understanding and recognition of dyslexia grew, families pushed for legal safeguards for dyslexic children. With the 2014 Children and Families Act, parents could apply for public funding to send their children to private schools that specifically catered to dyslexic students. First-tier tribunals, overseen by judges specialising in <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/list-of-members-of-the-tribunals-judiciary/first-tier-tribunals-judges/">education and social care issues</a>, would resolve these cases. These legal rights were easier to access with a diagnosis. And so more and more professionals began offering to meet the needs of the growing numbers of parents seeking dyslexia diagnoses for their children. Looking into dyslexia, Sirin realised that it was less a story about science and education and more one about social justice. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/22/the-fight-over-dyslexia-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
