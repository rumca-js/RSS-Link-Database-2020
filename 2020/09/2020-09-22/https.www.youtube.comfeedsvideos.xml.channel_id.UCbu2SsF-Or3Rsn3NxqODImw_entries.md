Tired of losing loot in Escape From Tarkov, being sent to the Warzone gulag in Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare, or feeling the pressure of his team watching him in Valorant, Dave installed AimLab.

 Did it help his aim? How much did his K/D improve? Do these things even work?

AimLab is a free early access tool that's build to help players improve their aim, reaction times, flick shots and more while using a suite of training tools as well as their own in-game AI to target a player's weaknesses.

In today's Save State, Persia talks about Metal Gear Solid favorites possibly coming back to PC, a trademark renewal for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver, and Nintendo accidentally leaking a new Kirby game. 

In this video, Persia talks about recent ratings and images spotted on the Taiwan Digital Rating Committee’s game site that hint at a few Metal Gear Solid favorites returning to PC. There hasn't been any announcement of new Metal Gear Solid PC ports, but Konami has repackaged PC ports in the past and has already re-released Metal Gear Solid titles in past collections. Tokyo Game Show is this weekend and Konami is scheduled for two panels where we might get more details.

Persia also talks about Nintendo renewing its trademarks for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. Japanese trademarks typically expire after 10 years of being filed, which corresponds with the game's lifespan. The renewal includes various products and services, but there's no mention of games.

And lastly, Persia covers Nintendo accidentally leaking Kirby Fighters 2 on its Game Finder tool. The Game Finder tool is designed to help parents pick Nintendo games for their kids. According to the listing, in Kirby Fighters 2, players will be able to choose from a pool of Kirby’s most iconic copy abilities as they fight to be the last Kirby standing. The now-deleted listing also mentioned new playable characters like Waddle Dee and King Dedede. 

This is your Save State for Wednesday, September 23rd.

The Generation Next crew break down what Xbox buying Bethesda means for Game Pass, and upcoming Bethesda games like Starfield and PS5 exclusives Ghostwire: Tokyo and Deathloop.

Unexpected news means an unexpected bonus episode of Generation Next. Microsoft has purchased ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. This landmark acquisition is going to have a significant impact on the future of video games so, just moments after the announcement, Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan sat down to talk about the implications.

For context, this is one of Microsoft's most expensive recent acquisitions, with the company spending more on Bethesda than it did on Minecraft. The $7.5 billion is even more than Disney spent on Marvel and Lucasfilm, which really drives home the value it sees in ZeniMax Media's subsidiary studios. 

For those unaware, the acquisition means Bethesda Softworks, Bethesda Game Studios, id Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, Arkane, MachineGames, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog join the Xbox family, bringing with them franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Doom, Dishonored, and Wolfenstein, among many others. 

So, what does it all mean? Watch this episode of Generation Next and find out. The gang covers everything from the particulars of the acquisition to the impact it'll have on Game Pass, and what it means for existing exclusivity deals with PlayStation, as well as how these studio purchases align with Xbox boss Phil Spencer's ethos of making gaming available to anyone and everyone.

Much like PS5 or RTX 3080, Xbox Series X & S preorders were a mess.  There's a new Season 6 trailer for Call of Duty Modern Warfare & Warzone, and Resident Evil Village and Monster Hunter will be at TGS. 

In your Save State for September 22, Chastity tells you about how the Xbox Series X & S preorders were a mess, much like PS5 or RTX 3080. Despite Microsoft telling people exactly when the preorders would go live, the demand was too much for retailer websites to handle.

We got a Season 6 cinematic trailer for Call of Duty Modern Warfare & Warzone, which revealed two new operators, Farah and Nikolai. They are also two of Modern Warfare's main characters in the campaign.

Finally, we’ll be learning more about Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin, and Resident Evil Village at Tokyo Games Show. TGS will air online from September 24-27. Monster Hunter Rise and Stories 2 will be shown on a live stream on Saturday, and Resident Evil Village will be on stream on Sunday.
