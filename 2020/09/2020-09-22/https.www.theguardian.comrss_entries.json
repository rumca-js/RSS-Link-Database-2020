But what surprised her most was how fiery the conversation around this condition had become, with some asking whether the term dyslexia should even exist</p><p>Most people in the UK will learn to read and write by the age of seven, but about 20% of the population will struggle to reach this level, and about half of these people are believed to be dyslexic, although not all of them will be diagnosed. Guardian journalist <strong>Sirin Kale</strong> tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about investigating questions around dyslexia - the science behind it, how people are diagnosed, who is diagnosed and what treatments work. </p><p>A 2019 <a href=\"https://cdn.bdadyslexia.org.uk/documents/Final-APPG-for-Human-cost-of-dyslexia-appg-report.pdf\">report from</a> the all-party parliamentary group for dyslexia found that children from lower income backgrounds were less likely to be diagnosed with dyslexia. As understanding and recognition of dyslexia grew, families pushed for legal safeguards for dyslexic children. With the 2014 Children and Families Act, parents could apply for public funding to send their children to private schools that specifically catered to dyslexic students. First-tier tribunals, overseen by judges specialising in <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.uk/about-the-judiciary/who-are-the-judiciary/list-of-members-of-the-tribunals-judiciary/first-tier-tribunals-judges/\">education and social care issues</a>, would resolve these cases. These legal rights were easier to access with a diagnosis. And so more and more professionals began offering to meet the needs of the growing numbers of parents seeking dyslexia diagnoses for their children. Looking into dyslexia, Sirin realised that it was less a story about science and education and more one about social justice. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/22/the-fight-over-dyslexia-podcast\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/22/the-fight-over-dyslexia-podcast", "date_published": "2020-09-22 02:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Video released showing Utah police shooting at boy with autism nearly a dozen times", "description": "<p>Salt Lake City 13-year-old remains in hospital after mother called 911, requesting mental health worker</p><p>A 13-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/08/linden-cameron-police-shooting-boy-autism-utah\">Utah boy with autism was shot by police</a> after his mother asked for help getting him hospital mental health treatment and officers agreed to talk with him, police footage released Monday showed.</p><p>The videos show Salt Lake City officers chasing him down an alley after they arrive at his home, then yelling at him to get on the ground.
