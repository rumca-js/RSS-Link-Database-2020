There hasn't been any announcement of new Metal Gear Solid PC ports, but Konami has repackaged PC ports in the past and has already re-released Metal Gear Solid titles in past collections. Tokyo Game Show is this weekend and Konami is scheduled for two panels where we might get more details.\n\nPersia also talks about Nintendo renewing its trademarks for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. Japanese trademarks typically expire after 10 years of being filed, which corresponds with the game's lifespan. The renewal includes various products and services, but there's no mention of games.\n\nAnd lastly, Persia covers Nintendo accidentally leaking Kirby Fighters 2 on its Game Finder tool. The Game Finder tool is designed to help parents pick Nintendo games for their kids. According to the listing, in Kirby Fighters 2, players will be able to choose from a pool of Kirby\u2019s most iconic copy abilities as they fight to be the last Kirby standing. The now-deleted listing also mentioned new playable characters like Waddle Dee and King Dedede. \n\nThis is your Save State for Wednesday, September 23rd.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2QrheLBaLw", "date_published": "2020-09-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare & Warzone - Official Season 6 Cinematic Trailer", "description": "Take to the tunnels.\n\nFarah and Nikolai bring the fight underground for Season Six of #ModernWarfare and #Warzone on September 29.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJDcIh4Ok0k", "date_published": "2020-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Buys Bethesda: What It Means For Game Pass, Starfield, PS5 + More | Generation Next", "description": "The Generation Next crew break down what Xbox buying Bethesda means for Game Pass, and upcoming Bethesda games like Starfield and PS5 exclusives Ghostwire: Tokyo and Deathloop.\n\nUnexpected news means an unexpected bonus episode of Generation Next. Microsoft has purchased ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. This landmark acquisition is going to have a significant impact on the future of video games so, just moments after the announcement, Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan sat down to talk about the implications.\n\nFor context, this is one of Microsoft's most expensive recent acquisitions, with the company spending more on Bethesda than it did on Minecraft. The $7.5 billion is even more than Disney spent on Marvel and Lucasfilm, which really drives home the value it sees in ZeniMax Media's subsidiary studios. \n\nFor those unaware, the acquisition means Bethesda Softworks, Bethesda Game Studios, id Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, Arkane, MachineGames, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog join the Xbox family, bringing with them franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Doom, Dishonored, and Wolfenstein, among many others. \n\nSo, what does it all mean? Watch this episode of Generation Next and find out. The gang covers everything from the particulars of the acquisition to the impact it'll have on Game Pass, and what it means for existing exclusivity deals with PlayStation, as well as how these studio purchases align with Xbox boss Phil Spencer's ethos of making gaming available to anyone and everyone. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:49 - Acquisition Cost + All Xbox Studios\n05:01 - Console Exclusivity\n06:59 - Game Pass + Starfield\n10:13 - Bethesda Games on PS+?\n11:19 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL_oruLNiMw", "date_published": "2020-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Preorders Were Almost As Bad As PS5's | Save State", "description": "Much like PS5 or RTX 3080, Xbox Series X & S preorders were a mess.
