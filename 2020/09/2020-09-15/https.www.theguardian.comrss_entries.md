Already, some pupils have been sent home amid reports of queues, mixed messages and rejections from testing centres around the country. Months after Boris Johnson promised that the UK would have a “world-beating” test, track and trace system by 1 June, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/moonshot-five-key-points-from-no-10s-leaked-coronavirus-testing-plan" title="">“Moonshot” project</a> to deliver 10m tests by early next year, which was announced last week, looks more like pie in the sky as each day passes.</p><p>Several months into the pandemic, it should not be beyond the capacity of ministers, in partnership with the NHS and others, to meet the current, more modest demand for tests. Yet, arrangements seem to be breaking down just when they are needed most. And as people struggle to reconcile official instructions to return to work and education with what they know about the risks of the virus, the likelihood of further serious disruption to millions of lives only increases.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/15/the-guardian-view-on-covid-testing-failures-level-with-us">Continue reading...</a>

## JK Rowling's Troubled Blood: don't judge a book by a single review

<p>It is tone-deaf of Rowling to write a killer who disguises himself in women’s clothing, but we should be wary when one review in the Telegraph is reproduced without question</p><p><strong>Warning: spoilers for Troubled Blood</strong></p><p>Before it had even come out, criticism of JK Rowling’s new Robert Galbraith thriller, Troubled Blood, was already wall-to-wall, after <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/troubled-blood-robert-galbraith-review-jk-rowling-fails-strike/">an early review in the Telegraph claimed</a> that its “moral seems to be: never trust a man in a dress”.</p><p>But is that the moral of the book? I’ve read it, the latest outing for Rowling’s private detective Cormoran Strike and his partner Robin Ellacott. In Troubled Blood, they have been tasked with investigating the disappearance of GP Margot Bamborough more than 40 years earlier. As the pair look into the disappearance – and this is a spoiler – one of the avenues they investigate is the possibility Margot was murdered by Dennis Creed, a now-imprisoned and notorious serial killer who once tricked some of his female victims into his van by wearing a wig and a woman’s coat to appear unthreatening. This has now been cited across the internet as further proof of Rowling’s transphobia, after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/10/jk-rowling-says-survivor-of-domestic-abuse-sexual-assault">her earlier essay</a>, tweets and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/28/jk-rowling-robert-f-kennedy-human-rights-award-trans-views">decision to return a human rights award</a> after the organisation behind it denounced her views. Amazon has now suspended reviews of the book due to “unusual reviewing activity”, while the hashtag #RIPJKRowling trends on Twitter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/sep/15/rowling-troubled-blood-thriller-robert-galbraith-review">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘If you own somewhere, you’re in control’: two couples on shared ownership and getting on the property ladder

<p>The scheme – which allows you to buy a percentage of a property and pay rent on the rest of it – appeals to many first-time buyers</p><p>When Amar and Amy got married, the next logical step was to buy their own home. But with a chunk of their savings gone on an expensive wedding, buying a flat or house with an easy commute into central London seemed a pipe dream. The couple are not alone – a <a href="https://www.nationwide.co.uk/-/media/MainSite/documents/about/house-price-index/2017/Dec_Q4_2017.pdf" rel="nofollow">20% deposit in London is now more than £80,000</a>, according to the Nationwide Building Society. So for Amy and Amar, as well as countless other couples, getting on the property ladder seemed unachievable. “We were both the first in our families to get married, so it was important to us to have a traditional Indian wedding – the cultural elements, the outfits, the big celebration,” says Amy. “But that doesn’t leave a lot for a house.”</p><p>Reluctant to rent, the couple moved in with Amar’s family while they planned their next move. They hadn’t heard of the shared ownership scheme until Amy’s brother, who works for a housing association, told them about it. The scheme allows you to <em> </em>buy a percentage of a property – usually a 25%-75% share – and pay rent on the rest. The housing association owns the remaining share, but you’re the homeowner and enjoy all the freedoms – from how it’s decorated and when to sell. The scheme is becoming more popular, with a recent Savills <a href="https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/282797-0" rel="nofollow">report</a> finding there were more than 13,400 shared ownership completions in 2018. “It really appealed to us,” says Amy, 30, who works in advertising. “The more we looked into it, the better it was. They are new properties in nice locations, and a part of it is ours and we can eventually buy the rest. It was a way of being able to get our own place rather than have to save up forever.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/shared-ownership-decoded/2020/sep/15/if-you-own-somewhere-youre-in-control-two-couples-on-shared-ownership-and-getting-on-the-property-ladder">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If you’ve heard about shared ownership but are hazy around the details, look no further. We grilled some housing experts to get the full picture …</p><p>Buying a home can be fraught with questions – how good are the local schools? Where’s the nearest train station, park or pub? – and one thing an increasing number of buyers are asking is whether shared ownership is an option that would work for them. We talked to experts to get clarity on what it means, how it works, and who exactly is eligible.</p><p><strong>Shared ownership? Sounds complicated. Do I have to share with someone?<br /></strong>This is probably the most common misconception about shared ownership, but it’s forgivable. “I think the name can be a little bit confusing”, says Sandy Kelly, head of sales at housing association Onward Living, who notes people often dismiss the idea of shared ownership, assuming they’d have to shack up with a stranger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/shared-ownership-decoded/2020/sep/15/will-i-have-to-share-my-house-with-a-stranger-and-six-other-shared-ownership-questions-answered">Continue reading...</a>

She was catapulted to fame by her groundbreaking study into female sexual response, The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality, published in 1976. Based on responses from 3,500 women to questionnaires about their experiences of sex and pleasure, the book has since sold almost 50m copies worldwide.</p><p>Sigmund Freud’s theory of the vaginal orgasm was thoroughly debunked following the publication of The Hite Report. Freud claimed that many women experienced orgasm through the clitoris but declared that such orgasms were sexually and psychologically immature and that women who could not orgasm through penetration were “frigid”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/15/shere-hite-obituary">Continue reading...</a>
