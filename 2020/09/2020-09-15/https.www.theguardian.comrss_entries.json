But with a chunk of their savings gone on an expensive wedding, buying a flat or house with an easy commute into central London seemed a pipe dream. The couple are not alone \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.nationwide.co.uk/-/media/MainSite/documents/about/house-price-index/2017/Dec_Q4_2017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">20% deposit in London is now more than \u00a380,000</a>, according to the Nationwide Building Society. So for Amy and Amar, as well as countless other couples, getting on the property ladder seemed unachievable. \u201cWe were both the first in our families to get married, so it was important to us to have a traditional Indian wedding \u2013 the cultural elements, the outfits, the big celebration,\u201d says Amy. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t leave a lot for a house.\u201d</p><p>Reluctant to rent, the couple moved in with Amar\u2019s family while they planned their next move. They hadn\u2019t heard of the shared ownership scheme until Amy\u2019s brother, who works for a housing association, told them about it. The scheme allows you to <em> </em>buy a percentage of a property \u2013 usually a 25%-75% share \u2013 and pay rent on the rest. The housing association owns the remaining share, but you\u2019re the homeowner and enjoy all the freedoms \u2013 from how it\u2019s decorated and when to sell. The scheme is becoming more popular, with a recent Savills <a href=\"https://www.savills.co.uk/research_articles/229130/282797-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">report</a> finding there were more than 13,400 shared ownership completions in 2018. \u201cIt really appealed to us,\u201d says Amy, 30, who works in advertising. \u201cThe more we looked into it, the better it was. They are new properties in nice locations, and a part of it is ours and we can eventually buy the rest.
