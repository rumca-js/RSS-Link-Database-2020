Facial Masking for Covid-19 — Potential for “Variolation” as We Await a Vaccine (NEJM, 14th September)

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913

https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp2026913?articleTools=true

Universal mask wearing might make mild or asymptomatic disease more likely

A form of “variolation” 

Inoculation

Generate immunity and thereby slow the spread of the virus

Viral shedding from the noses and mouths of patients, presymptomatic or asymptomatic

Shedding rates equivalent to those among symptomatic patients

SARS -1

A strong relationship between public masking and pandemic control 

SARS - CoV - 2

Recent virologic, epidemiologic, and ecologic data

Hypothesis that facial masking may also reduce the severity of disease among people who 
do become infected 

Long-standing theory of viral pathogenesis

Severity of disease is proportionate to the viral inoculum received 

Typical rate of asymptomatic infection, estimated to be 40% by the CDC in mid-July,

Settings with universal facial masking, 80%

Also less severe and less deaths

Mixture of two monoclonal antibodies

Both attach to the spike of the virus at slightly different places

Making good progress with a COVID vaccine

60 per cent chance, will know by the end of October their vaccine was effective and safe

Trials have been carried out on 30,000 people, and that is expanding to 44,000

Then move on to FDA to certify

Already had 'hundreds of thousands' of doses ready to go

Lockdown early

Restricted domestic travel

Contact tracing teams and isolation facilities across the country

Face masks mandatory outside

Hand washing and temperature checking points across urban areas. 

Antigen tests, private $10 - $100

Dr Richard Ayah, Public health, University of Nairobi

The testing figures reflect the ability to pay, not the reality

Widespread social stigma

Fear of government quarantine facilities

April and May

Hundreds / thousands of suspected infections

Forced into government isolation centres

Made to pay fees and do exercise regimes for a fortnight or more 

Ms Achieng, forced to be tested, isolation centre for four weeks, and forced to pay $20 a day

Irene, a nurse, working in a clinic in Kibera

This hardline approach has dealt fundamental damage to the overall public health response 

and removed any incentive for people to get treatment for Covid-19 symptoms

unless they are on death’s door

Dr Ayah

tTotal number of deaths is around 4,000. 
x 6.5 official death toll

Kenya’s Ministry of Health

80 to 91 % of infections in hospitals seem to be asymptomatic

https://allafrica.com/stories/202007030328.html

2.7 million exposed by 2nd July

Kenya Medical Research Institute and Wellcome Trust

12.4 % of Nairobi residents could be having the virus

Kisumu, (third largest town) 7.5 % of the samples tested positive

Mombasa, 100,000 people, 8.6 % 

2,535 blood samples donated between April 30 and June 16.

It is estimated that 78 per cent of patients are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms.

Africa should be part of the roadmap for COVID-19 research

We just keep praying to god it doesn’t get worse (nurse) 

More deaths in Brazil, India or the US

Recent data, record low infection rates over the last month
