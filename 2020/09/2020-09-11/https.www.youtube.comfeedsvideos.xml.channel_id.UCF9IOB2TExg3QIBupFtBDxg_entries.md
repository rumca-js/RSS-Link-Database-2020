Low plasma 25(OH) vitamin D level is associated with increased risk of COVID‐19 infection: an Israeli population‐based study (Federation of European Biochemical Societies Journal)

Vitamin D deficiency is a worldwide pandemic

To evaluate associations of plasma 25(OH)D levels with the likelihood of coronavirus disease infection and hospitalization

N = 7, 807 

February 1st to April 30th, 2020

Participants had one previous blood test for the plasma 25(OH)D level

Suboptimal’ or ‘low’ plasma 25(OH)D. Below 30 ng/mL

Sufficiency more than 30 ng/ml. (75 nmol/L)

Insufficiency, 20 – 29 ng/ml

Deficiency less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L)

7, 807 individuals

Risk by age and sex were as expected

Obesity not significantly associated with increased risk for COVID‐19 infection or hospitalization 

Sufficient vitamin D levels

7, 025 tested negative

Low vitamin D levels

782 tested positive

Increased likelihood of COVID‐19 infection
Odds ratio (OR) of 1.45

Increased likelihood of hospitalisation
OR of 1.95

We concluded that low plasma 25(OH)D levels appear to be an independent risk factor for COVID‐19 infection and hospitalization.

The link between vitamin D deficiency and Covid-19 in a large population 

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.04.20188268v1.full.pdf

52, 405 infected patients

524, 050 controls

Greater incidence of COVID-19 with lower vitamin D levels

Highest infection prevalence with lowest vitamin D levels

A significant protective effect in those who had supplemented over the previous 4 months

Spend at least 15-30 minutes with direct sun exposure each day

Most older and younger adults can safely take 400-1000 IU daily

Vitamin-D and COVID-19: do deficient risk a poorer outcome?  (Lancet)

Comparing data across nations, mortality from COVID-19 is clearly higher in some countries than in others

Relative vitamin D status of populations

Vitamin D supplementation could be especially important for older people

Functions

Calcium and phosphate balance

Affecting bone growth and turnover

Low vitamin D status

Associated with increased susceptibility to infectious disease

Notably, upper respiratory tract infections

Treating the lowest levels gives most percentage benefit

Vitamin D and COVID-19

Virus emerged and started its spread in the northern hemisphere at the end of 2019

When levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are lowest

COVID-19 mortality was significantly associated with vitamin D status in different populations

Nordic countries, widespread fortification of foods

Italy and Spain, prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, surprisingly common

Black and minority ethnic people

UK, more than four times more likely to die from COVID-19

In COVID

Vitamin D supports production of antimicrobial peptides in the respiratory epithelium

Might help to reduce the inflammatory response

Vitamin D is known to interact angiotensin- converting enzyme 2

SARS-CoV-2 down regulates expression of ACE2

Vitamin D promotes expression of this gene

Rose Anne Kenny

Lead investigator of the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing

The circumstantial evidence is very strong

we don’t have randomised controlled trial evidence, but how long do you want to wait in the context of such a crisis? 

We know vitamin D is important for musculoskeletal function, so people should be taking it anyway

Vitamin D supplements should normally be given to care home residents unless there is an extremely good reason not to do so. 

Adrian Martineau 

Queen Mary University of London

At best vitamin D deficiency will only be one of many factors involved in determining outcome of COVID-19

but it’s a problem that could be corrected safely and cheaply

there is no downside to speak of, and good reason to think there might be a benefit

Vitamin D dose

IU  mcg
400  10mcg
800  20mcg
1,000 25mcg
2,000 50mcg
4,000 100mcg

India
In my city Indore in India the situation is disastrous, In last 2 weeks I have at least heard from 80-100 known contacts like friends, my cousins and friends of friends being infected with covid. Just today my neighbour who lives just around 4-5 houses away died of covid. Worst situation I have seen till now in my city. Out of these 7 people have died. I think death rate is much higher than official numbers. Please everyone do take care I am also trying to stay home as much as possible.


India

Cases, + 95, 735 + 96,551 = 4.5 million

World’s fastest growth rate

Deaths + 1, 172 + 1,209 = 76,271

+1,000 for past 10 days

Tests, 1 million per day

Spreads to smaller towns and villages

Delhi, Pune, Mumbai and Chennai, worst-hit cities

UK

32,359 close contacts with someone who had tested positive

Where communication details were available, 79.4% were reached and asked to self- isolate

Taking into account all contacts identified, 69.2% were reached

PM briefing, 9th September

Hands – Face – Space – test

Universities not to send infected students home

So far identify people who are positive

Identify negative allowing them to behave in a normal way

New types of scalable tests

Swabs, saliva

90 - 20 minutes

No measures therefore required, all events and venues could be on

Isolated people released

Pilot study, Salford

Indoor and outdoor venues

Test manufacture and distribution

Well rolled out by Christmas

Widespread by Spring 2021

Testing 10 m people a day

Everything would need to come together

SAGE Scientific Advisory Group for Emergences

100 billion cost

Ministers say technology does not yet exist

Test and trace better

False positives

At best 1% would be false positives

66 m population = 660,000 self-isolating per week

False negatives

Plus people with any symptoms still need to self-isolate

False sense of security

Birmingham

Population, 1.14 million

Cases, + 892 (past 7 days)

Previous 7 days, cases + 30

78.2 cases per 100,000

Patrick Valence

8 in phase 3 trials

Good immune response, in elderly as well as younger people

Different types of vaccines

Manufacturing in UK for some

Next year sometime
