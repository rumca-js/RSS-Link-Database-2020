<p>Dating people was hard at first. Some people told me it was adorable, which was infuriating</p><p>I grew up in the small town of Dunnavant, Alabama, the kind of place where everybody knows everybody. I was just a nice normal kid. Then in 2006, I went off to the University of North Alabama and got into partying every night, drinking a lot and taking pills – prescription opiates and barbiturates. They were prescribed for my arthritis and migraines, but I started abusing them and things spiralled out of control. I used to pharmacy hop to get multiple prescriptions; I became an addict.</p><p>One night in March 2008, I drank a ton of vodka and washed down a lot of pills. I woke up the next morning and remembered absolutely nothing. I started hiccupping. All morning, they wouldn’t stop. I used to get hiccups a lot, so thought it was just another bout. But they didn’t go away, and my neck and chest started to hurt pretty badly. After a week, I went to the campus infirmary. They just shrugged them off and said nothing was wrong.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/11/experience-had-hiccups-for-12-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The president’s alleged disparagement of US soldiers may have given pause even to some of his staunch supporters </p><p>It has been a while since I’ve travelled through an airport in the US, but I assume that in that time, nothing has changed. Specifically: buying snacks in a branch of Hudson News and being asked, while paying, if you would like to make a donation with your purchase to support the US military. This never got any less weird, not just the solicitation, but the piety with which it was made. As a friend said after one such experience, he was sorely tempted to reply, “on the contrary: I would like to reduce their budget by at least 80%”. It would, we suspected, result in instantaneous repatriation to Britain.</p><p>Reverence for the military is a cultural norm in the US that makes the recent Donald Trump firestorm around veterans unusual.

<p>Casual intimacies and dreamlike interludes in a bestselling Japanese author’s exploration of freedom and the female body</p><p>Does a body’s ability to become pregnant and nurse a child – that is, the possession of breasts and eggs – determine the fate of that body? For impoverished novelist Natsuko, the protagonist of Mieko Kawakami’s Japanese bestseller, motherhood and self-sacrifice seem to encapsulate the experience of working-class women. But she wonders: can breasts and eggs give rise to liberation? What makes a person free?</p><p>Novelist and politician Shintaro Ishihara described <em>Breasts and Eggs</em> as “unpleasant and intolerable”, which might be another way to say that it is not afraid of sperm, used menstrual pads, poverty and the working poor. Natsuko’s language, as translated by Sam Bett and David Boyd, is actually quite polite. I had the feeling of listening to someone speaking in the dark: casual intimacies interspersed with fanciful, terrifying and dreamlike interludes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/11/breasts-and-eggs-by-mieko-kawakami-review-an-interrogation-of-the-female-condition">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This Brexiter government is pursuing its political goal, whatever the economic cost. Its predecessors did the same<br /></p><p>“There is no alternative” was the mantra of British politics from the 1980s to the very recent past. To bring about change it was necessary to unleash enterprise, or globalisation, or technology. Politics was about staying out of the economy, and coping with the social consequences. But there always was an alternative – it is just that the loudest voices denied it. As Adam Tooze has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/jul/29/city-of-london-desperate-gamble-china-vulnerable-economy">noted</a>, the state never left the economy, it just changed its role, and its visibility. Since the 1980s the economy has been actively reshaped by a series of political-economic decisions by successive activist governments.</p><p>Over the years, the aims of British political-economic policy have changed. Once, the main concerns were the national rate of growth, the national balance of trade, reducing inequalities within the boundaries of the nation, and strengthening the nation compared with others. Since the 1980s, and by these measures, things have not got better. Neither under Thatcher nor under New Labour, let alone more recently, did the UK achieve the rates of GDP growth of the 1950s and 1960s. Since the 1980s the balance of trade has stayed systematically worse than in the 1950s or 1960s.

## My old car was a reminder of a time when I felt young and invincible | Emma Withers

<p>As the tow truck driver pulled her up the ramp and clipped her in, I realised I was potentially going to cry <br /></p><p>I learned to drive when I was 22. Most of my peers had started driving at 18 and because I had left it late by the time I decided to learn, driving had taken on an almost mythological quality. I would sit in the passenger seat and watch friends drive with a sense of awe. How on earth were these mere mortals talking and driving and breathing AT THE SAME TIME? How were they not falling off the road and screaming with terror?</p><p>It is an understatement to say that driving did not come naturally to me. I would feel almost dizzy thinking I might forget which pedal was the brake and which was the accelerator. I would peer out of my window as I inched along the road, absolutely unable to work out how much space my car took up. My very patient driving instructor would sit in the passenger seat, encouraging me to look ahead. This, he assured me, was the secret to driving: look at where you want to go, and go.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/11/my-old-car-was-a-reminder-of-a-time-when-i-felt-young-and-invincible">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From online etiquette to study schedules, here’s everything you need to know to work effectively out of the classroom</p><p>For Christian Jones, who has just finished a master’s in broadcast journalism at City University of London, the rapid shift to online learning due to Covid-19 came as a bit of a shock. “I spent the first week not setting alarms,” he says. “It’s easy to end up going to bed late and waking up really late. Then you don’t get anything done.”</p><p>Students in the UK have been prevented from entering lecture theatres since late March, and so have had to quickly adjust to studying online. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/10/new-covid-plan-for-england-could-confine-university-students-to-halls">the latest government guidance</a>, students in England could be confined to their halls of residence in the new term, so it’s expected that blended learning – a mix of online and face-to-face teaching – will continue. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/11/you-wont-be-left-on-your-own-expert-tips-for-freshers-on-studying-at-home">Continue reading...</a>

## A shimmering reflection doesn’t just light up your day – it can be transcendent | Hannah Jane Parkinson

<p>There is something captivating about this trick of light and science</p><p>Humans are both vain and insecure; in fact, two sides of the same coin. Perhaps because, too often, for me the latter outweighs the former, I don’t love looking into mirrors. I do, however, love reflections.</p><p>Some are shimmering, dancing: the light that bounces from lido water as one cuts through it; the way a sea is studded with diamonds in the distance. At home, clearing out an old chest, I found a miniature mirrorball. I have no idea where it came from, but as I placed it on the floor, intending to discard it later, the sun streamed through my window and threw bright yellow squares all across the room; the walls, the ceilings, the fireplace. I kept the mirrorball. Every time it is sunny, the room is lit up. It is stunningly beautiful and I appreciate it each time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/11/shimmering-reflection-light-up-your-day-transcendent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We went from keen teachers to calculating how many hours of TV our daughter could watch without doing permanent damage. But it also made us feel it was our family against the world</p><p>We can’t say we weren’t warned. “Do not attempt to turn your kitchen into a classroom,” said a teacher friend when the schools shut. “You’re not teachers; you never will be.” Rubbish, we thought. We were up for it and we had all the gear: a little desk, a whiteboard, dozens of books, drawers full of pens, stickers and cardboard. We spent a weekend lovingly building a little classroom in the corner of the kitchen for our four-year-old daughter, Aster.</p><p>We had felt pretty smug when lockdown hit. Two years earlier, we had embraced the open-plan-living dream, building a huge kitchen extension at the back of the house.

Earlier, Naomi Osaka overcame Jennifer Brady in high class 7-6(1), 3-6, 6-3 tussle.

For Williams and Azarenka, this meant the rekindling of one of the defining rivalries of the previous decade. The pair have stared each other down in 23 matches over 12 years and such familiarity was an asset for Williams early on. She had struggled through a triad of three-set matches over the fortnight, but on Thursday was all too aware that her previous form would not suffice. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/10/us-open-womens-semi-final-serena-williams-naomi-osaka-jennifer-brady">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor talks about growing up without a sense of home, how he went from hairdressing to a leading role – and the joy of filming sex scenes with Parker Sawyers</p><p>As a child growing up in an international expat community in Dungun, Malaysia, Henry Golding used to tell his mum off whenever she tried to teach him Malay. Everyone they knew spoke English anyway; why did he have to learn? All he wanted to do was to fit in with his friends. “But then, when I went back as an adult to Malaysia, I was kind of embarrassed that I wasn’t able to speak Malay.”</p><p>With a Malaysian mum of Iban ancestry and an English dad, Golding, 33, has spent his whole life navigating two cultures but feeling as if he doesn’t quite fully belong to either one. Being of mixed heritage meant “never quite understanding a sense of home”. Was it Malaysia, where he was born? Or England, where he moved to when he was eight? When, soon after filming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/13/crazy-rich-asians-review-kevin-kwan">Crazy Rich Asians</a>, the romcom blockbuster that would make him an overnight sensation, Golding got the script for <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8090564/">Monsoon</a>, he connected straight away with its sensitive exploration of a gay British Vietnamese man’s search for identity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/11/henry-golding-moving-from-malaysia-to-surrey-was-a-slap-in-the-face">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Those in government pushing for a no-deal Brexit should try to feed two people for a tenner a week, as I did</p><p>I’ll never forget trying to feed myself and my son on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/20/10-pound-food-shop-blog">£10 a week</a>. I was a single mum, absolutely skint and living hand to mouth, even after I started working as a trainee reporter for the Southend Echo, following 18 long months of looking for a job.</p><p>So, for those first shifts until a pay cheque arrived, food meant a Tupperware tub of cold pasta with a spoonful or two of cheap pasta sauce from a jar, which, weirdly, is cheaper than buying tinned tomatoes to make your own. And, when you’ve got no money, every pinch of herbs or flavour becomes a luxury.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/11/no-one-food-poverty-let-it-spread-brexit-pandemic-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

He, his partner, Fiona Millar, and their daughter, Grace Campbell, discuss the impact it has had on their lives </p><p>Every morning <strong>Alastair Campbell</strong>, the former spin doctor to Tony Blair, wakes up and rates, on his depression scale, how he feels that day. One is pure, unadulterated happiness; five is the beginning of the danger zone; seven is the signal to cancel meetings, stay indoors, avoid people; and when that slips to eight or nine, to get into bed and sleep as much as possible.</p><p>He tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> what it feels like to go through a depressive period, and how he has learned to manage his mental health over the years. Anushka also talks to Campbell’s partner, <strong>Fiona Millar,</strong> who has been with him for almost 40 years, and their daughter <strong>Grace Campbell.</strong> They discuss the toll his depression has had on their family and how seeking professional help – 20 years after he had a nervous breakdown, aged 28 – was a turning point in his recovery. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2020/sep/11/alastair-campbell-and-his-family-on-living-with-his-depression-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
