Pay me $1,200 and I can make Mr. Wonderful (Kevin O'Leary) say anything. 

Shark Tank was one of my favorite shows when I was younger but lately I've noticed some of the 'sharks' like Robert Herjavec, Daymond John and Kevin O'Leary have been selling out their reputations to try to maximize short term profits. Kevin O'Leary has sold out with Cameo. He's done hundreds, if not thousands of Cameos doing 'shoutouts', which amount to almost endorsements, all undisclosed... these are then parlayed into social credibility from the people who pretend that Kevin O'Leary is all about their products.
