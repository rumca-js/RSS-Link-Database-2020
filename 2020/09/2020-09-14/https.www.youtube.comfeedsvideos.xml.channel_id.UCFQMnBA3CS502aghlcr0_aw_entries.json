Kevin O'Leary has sold out with Cameo. He's done hundreds, if not thousands of Cameos doing 'shoutouts', which amount to almost endorsements, all undisclosed... these are then parlayed into social credibility from the people who pretend that Kevin O'Leary is all about their products.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3gH6zqjU-8", "date_published": "2020-09-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
