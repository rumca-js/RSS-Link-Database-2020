In this episode, Kyle and Ethan talk to Sam Sorbo, who is a major advocate for home education when many people are starting to look at it as an alternative in an age of virtual schooling, pandemic lockdowns, and kindergartners doing 2 hour zoom meetings. Her books include They‚Äôre Your Kids: An Inspirational Journey From Self- Doubter To Home School Advocate and Teach From Love: A School Year Devotional For Families. Her new book, with her husband Kevin, is True Faith: Embracing Adversity to Live in God's Light. She is also the host of The Sam Sorbo Podcast.
