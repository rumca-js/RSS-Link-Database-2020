Thursday\u2019s performative theatrics did little more than provide cover to vulnerable Republicans and add one more day to the now six weeks since Senate Republicans refused to extend the extra $600 in Covid-related weekly jobless benefits. With McConnell sounding all but liberated from any more pressure to show compassion before the election, and the media\u2019s attention pinned to shinier Trumpian objects, it is even more imperative to refocus on the crisis at hand and to dig beneath the hollow excuses for such demonstrable indifference on the part of lawmakers. It is time to find an answer to how is such unnecessary suffering justified?</p><p>According to the Republicans, the aid is \u201ctoo generous\u201d and \u201cdisincentivizes\u201d the unemployed from seeking work. So perverse are the effects of these benefits, they argue, that it is actually workers gaming the system who are slowing the economic recovery, not the Covid-driven loss of millions of jobs. That these charges persist despite significant evidence to the contrary testifies to the power of the conservative creed that few things in life are more perilous than excess government compassion</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/14/republican-skinny-coronavirus-relief-mitch-mcconnell\">Even the Republican \u2018skinny\u2019 relief bill failed.

The turkey is a noble steed in Derek Yu\u2019s latest cave-delving \u201croguelike\u201d, in which each run presents a unique set of levels, progress is lost when you die, and the bird must be tamed before offering its services. This involves leaping into the saddle and letting it careen wildly around, hopefully not tipping you on to a bed of spikes or into the fangs of a mantrap. Once settled, you and your festive friend can flap around the level, headbutting spiders and using its decaying flight trajectory to lower yourself past traps and hungry mouths towards the exit.</p><p>But the turkey is also subject to the merciless logic of the Spelunky universe. Laid on a ritual altar, it will be sacrificed to appease the gods. Propelled upward by an unplanned explosion, it may meet a pointy end when it returns to earth. Set aflame, well, it will become a roast turkey, and you may consume it for an extra health point as you sob quietly.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/14/spelunky-2-review-run-jump-and-die-hilariously\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/14/spelunky-2-review-run-jump-and-die-hilariously", "date_published": "2020-09-14 12:58:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Saskia Reeves: \u2018My character in Us could do with some help\u2019", "description": "<p>Known for varied roles on stage and screen, Reeves now plays a disaffected wife on a European road trip in the BBC\u2019s David Nicholls adaptation.

And, to be honest, I blame the mushroom risotto. Last week when I looked at the schedule to remind myself what I should be writing about, I was not happy to see those two words, a rain dance for autumn. And, sure enough, when I went to buy the rice and dried mushrooms, summer snapped and it rained. Then it stopped, there was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-44904298#:~:text=its%20enduring%20appeal.-,Wet%20earth,ground%20is%20produced%20by%20bacteria.&amp;text=%22It%27s%20a%20really%20potent%20material,%2C%22%20said%20perfumer%20Marina%20Barcenilla.\">that smell</a> and, because it is still warm, everything dried back to a cracker.

She notes there is a well defined method, and I follow hers, also remembering her four bits of advice like a rhyme. Correct rice (carnaroli or arborio work well for most, then stumpy <em>vialone nano</em> for vegetable or fish risotti). A heavy-based pan with space for the rice to increase its volume by nearly three times. Good, well-flavoured stock. And template proportions: 300g rice, 1.3 litres of stock, 60g butter and 45g parmesan for four people (although depending on the day I might add a bit more). Del Conte also points out the clinking sound of the rice as it toasts slightly in the pan, before the liquid is added. Then, the steady addition of the stock (or other liquid). Risotto is a commitment to the pan for 16-20 minutes: you are the facilitator, the bridge, between the ingredients and the result. And, yes, there are oven, no-stir methods, but this is not that: this is my rain-dance risotto.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/14/rachel-roddy-mushroom-risotto-recipe\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/14/rachel-roddy-mushroom-risotto-recipe", "date_published": "2020-09-14 10:00:25+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Margaret Atwood wins Dayton literary peace prize", "description": "<p>Handmaid\u2019s Tale author honoured for reminding readers that \u2018anything can happen anywhere given the right circumstances\u2019<br /></p><p>Margaret Atwood, whose sweeping body of work includes The Handmaid\u2019s Tale, a depiction of a nightmarish totalitarian future for the US, has won a lifetime achievement award that celebrates literature\u2019s power to foster peace, social justice and global understanding.</p><p>The Canadian writer will receive the Richard C Holbrooke distinguished achievement award, officials of the Dayton literary peace prize officials announced on Monday.
