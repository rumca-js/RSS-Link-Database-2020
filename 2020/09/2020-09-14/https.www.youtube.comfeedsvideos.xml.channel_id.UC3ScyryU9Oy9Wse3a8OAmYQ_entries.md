Their resulting conversation in the new FRONTLINE documentary “Policing the Police 2020” illustrates the debate over use of force in policing: what’s legal, what’s justified and whether those definitions should change. The film is supported by Chasing the Dream, a public media initiative from The WNET Group in New York that examines poverty, justice and economic opportunity in America.
