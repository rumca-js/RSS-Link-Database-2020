Lockdown early

Restricted domestic travel

Contact tracing teams and isolation facilities across the country

Face masks mandatory outside

Hand washing and temperature checking points across urban areas. 

Antigen tests, private $10 - $100

Dr Richard Ayah, Public health, University of Nairobi

The testing figures reflect the ability to pay, not the reality

Widespread social stigma

Fear of government quarantine facilities

April and May

Hundreds / thousands of suspected infections

Forced into government isolation centres

Made to pay fees and do exercise regimes for a fortnight or more 

Ms Achieng, forced to be tested, isolation centre for four weeks, and forced to pay $20 a day

Irene, a nurse, working in a clinic in Kibera

This hardline approach has dealt fundamental damage to the overall public health response 

and removed any incentive for people to get treatment for Covid-19 symptoms

unless they are on death’s door
