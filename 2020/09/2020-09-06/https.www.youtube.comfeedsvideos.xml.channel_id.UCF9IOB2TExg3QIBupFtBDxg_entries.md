Measles

https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/measles

During 2000- 2018, measles vaccination prevented 23.2 million deaths

73% drop in measles deaths

2018

86% of the world's children received one dose of measles vaccine by their first birthday

140 000 measles deaths globally, children under the age of five

Vaccine optimism

William Petri, Division of Infectious Diseases and International Health, University of Virginia

The immune system clears the virus in 99% + of infections

https://www.psychiatrictimes.com/view/covid-19-has-mortality-rate-declined

Some may have low levels of virus in the body for up to three months

Not normally infectious after day 10

Immune system fails to clear HIV

SARS-CoV-2 doesn’t mutate as HIV does

SARS-CoV-2 needs its spike protein to be infectious

Antibodies have been proved (in vitro) to bind to the spike protein

Therefore neutralizing the spike protein

Vaccines in clinical trials, generate spike protein antibodies

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/806

Monoclonal antibodies could give passive immunity

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6505/752

Seven companies developing MABs

Currently being trial for post exposure protection

May also be effective for treatment

Spike protein has many locations where antibodies can bind

https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6504/643

Many vulnerable spots

Therefore, many protein changes in the spike protein would be needed to evade neutralizing antibodies

If there were to be several sike protein mutations it would no longer bind into the ACE-2 receptor anyway

Vaccination science is developed

Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection

Allergic reactions

Use of adjuvants

About 42% of the US population is vitamin D deficient

82% in black people

70% in Hispanics

Cohort study of 489

Relative risk of testing positive for COVID-19 was 1.77 times

First clinical trial on vitamin D and COVID

Therapy versus best Available Therapy on Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality Among Patients Hospitalized for COVID-19: A Pilot Randomized Clinical study" (Spain, Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology)

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960076020302764

Objective

Vitamin D decreases Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome

Effect of calcifediol treatment

Calcifediol can rapidly increase serum 25OHD concentration

25-hydroxyvitamin D 

Intensive Care Unit Admission and Mortality

Spanish patients hospitalized for COVID-19.

Design

Parallel pilot, randomized, double-masked clinical trial

Setting

Reina Sofia University Hospital, Córdoba, Spain

Participants

76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection

Clinical picture of acute respiratory infection

Confirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia

Positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR

Procedures

All hospitalized patients received as best available therapy

Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin 

Allocated at a 2 calcifediol:1 

Oral calcifediol (0.532 mg), or not

Oral calcifediol (0.266 mg) on day 3 and 7

Then weekly until discharge

End points, ICU admission and deaths.

Results

50 patients treated with calcifediol

One required admission to the ICU (2%),

Of 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%)

p  less than 0.001

Of the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications

Of the patients not treated, 2 died

Conclusion

Calcifediol seems to be able to reduce severity of the disease

Larger trials with groups properly matched will be required to show a definitive answer

Rationale, activation of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) signalling pathway

Reduced ARDS

Cytokine/chemokine storm

Regulating the renin angiotensin system

Modulating neutrophil activity 

Maintaining the integrity of the pulmonary epithelial barrier

Stimulating epithelial repair

Tapering down the increased coagulability 


Ventilate

Don't abdicate
Dilute that virus 
So you stay great
Ventilate
Don't complicate,
Complain or whine
You'll acclimate
Contemplate
When you congregate
Does the air here circulate 
Instigate, Nominate
Educate, Motivate
I hope this message will resonate
That when we populate 
Instead of isolate
Ventilate
Don't abdicate
Dilute that virus 
So you stay great
