<p>This new four-part series sees the documentary maker revisit the highlights of his long and varied career, from cornering hucksters to run-ins with neo-Nazis</p><p>Louis Theroux: Life on the Edge (BBC Two), which showcased the highlights of the documentary maker’s 25 years in the weirdo-pursuit biz, probably wants to be called a retrospective rather than a clip job. I am feeling generous, so I will let you choose. But there were a lot of clips, and not much else.</p><p>But what clips they were. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mfgb">The first episode</a> of four thematically arranged outings dealt with matters of belief. So we met – or re-met, if you remember his first appearance in the inaugural episode of Louis Theroux’s Weird Weekends in 1998 – Colonel Bo Gritz. The real-life inspiration for Rambo and the founder of the Almost Heaven covenant community, Gritz and his ilk were last seen hunkering down in the Idaho hills and prepping for war with the federal government and the ensuing New World Order. A brief Zoom call to catch up with the head of the community’s leading family, Mike, revealed that he has retained his old certainties and is impressed with Trump’s fearlessness in sticking it to the gubernatorial Man.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/06/louis-theroux-life-on-the-edge-review-25-years-of-oddball-odysseys">Continue reading...</a>

The target, 158, was not formidable but, as the Australians are all too aware, such middling scores can be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/04/england-win-t20-thriller-after-australia-throw-away-golden-chance">tricky to overhaul</a>. But with Buttler at the crease there was no slip-up. He purred to an unbeaten 77 from 54 balls and finished the match with seven deliveries to spare with a straight six off Adam Zampa that cleared the boundary by about 40 yards. So England won the game by six wickets and have taken the series; if they win the final game on Tuesday evening they overtake Australia as the No 1 T20 side in the ICC’s rankings table.</p><p>Afterwards Eoin Morgan affirmed that he would play the best XI for the final game having hailed “a better bowling performance. Jofra [Archer] set the tone in that first over and when you’ve got a world-class player like Jos Buttler in form it makes the chase easier.” Unsurprisingly Buttler will stay at the top of the order for the moment and the man himself acknowledged afterwards “it’s the best place to bat in T20 cricket and my favourite position but I’m happy to bat anywhere. It’s up to the captain and coach.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/06/jos-buttler-helps-england-seal-series-with-comfortable-win-against-australia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian’s Africa correspondent on life in a country that has fought and faced down more than one epidemic</p><p>In the evening I went for a run, down to the gate from my guesthouse, past a huddle of round huts and through the fields of sugar cane to the lake. A dog barked, a child howled, someone laughed, and tinny music played somewhere in the gathering darkness.</p><p>Eshowe, a small town in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal province, is a place of astonishing natural beauty. The run did not last long. I stopped and watched as weavers, glossy starlings and sunbirds swooped through the trees, catching the last rays of the sun. To the north, low dry hills lined the horizon. To the south, the breakers of the Indian Ocean crashed on miles of wild shore. Eshowe was memorable for something else too: the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/07/there-is-no-magic-bullet-the-town-that-turned-the-tide-against-hiv">very human suffering I found there, and equally human hope</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/06/covering-covid-19-in-africa-the-virus-cannot-stop-this-life-and-energy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The philosopher believes the liberal left’s pursuit of meritocracy has betrayed the working classes. His new book argues for a politics centred on dignity</p><p>Michael Sandel was 18 years old when he received his first significant lesson in the art of politics. The future philosopher was president of the student body at Palisades high school, California, at a time when Ronald Reagan, then governor of the state, lived in the same town. Never short of confidence, in 1971 Sandel challenged him to a debate in front of 2,400 left-leaning teenagers. It was the height of the Vietnam war, which had radicalised a generation, and student campuses of any description were hostile territory for a conservative. Somewhat to Sandel’s surprise, Reagan took up the gauntlet that had been thrown down, arriving at the school in style in a black limousine. The subsequent encounter confounded the expectations of his youthful interlocutor.</p><p>“I had prepared a long list of what I thought were very tough questions,” recalls Sandel, now 67, via video-link from his study in Boston. “On Vietnam, on the right of 18-year-olds to vote – which Reagan opposed – on the United Nations, on social security. I thought I would make short work of him in front of that audience. He responded genially, amiably and respectfully. After an hour I realised I had not prevailed in this debate, I had lost. He had won us over without persuading us with his arguments. Nine years later he would get elected to the White House in the same way.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/06/michael-sandel-the-populist-backlash-has-been-a-revolt-against-the-tyranny-of-merit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As more women take charge of commercial beer production, a new book reveals their pivotal role in the industry historically</p><p>It’s an industry long associated with men, from the whiskered industrialists of the 19th century to the hipster craft brewers of the present. But women have played a significant role in brewing beer in Britain, and are increasingly running breweries and creating new beers.</p><p>A new book, published this week, unearths the pivotal role of women in family breweries. “Beer is often portrayed as a male domain, even though many iconic breweries would not be what they are today if they didn’t have strong women at the helm,” says its author, the veteran beer expert and real-ale advocate Roger Protz.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/06/how-victorian-female-brewers-broke-the-pint-glass-ceiling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The German-born photographer, best known for his images of Nelson Mandela and coverage of apartheid, died last weekend</p><p>Jürgen Schadeberg, whose death at the age of 89 was announced last week, grew up in wartime Germany before emigrating to South Africa in 1950. Though perhaps best known for his portraits of Nelson Mandela, he leaves behind several important bodies of work including an extensive series on the effects of apartheid on South Africa’s black communities.</p><p>When he first arrived there, Schadeberg was shocked by the extent of the apartheid laws. His status as an outsider gained him access to black communities that, he later recalled, were “becoming more and more dynamic on the cultural and political front, while the white world seemed isolated, stuck in its ways, so colonial and totally ignorant of the life of the blacks”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/06/the-big-picture-jurgen-schadebergs-portrait-of-singers-in-1950s-south-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a botched response to the pandemic, No 10 is now poised to sever EU trading ties and split the union</p><p>Covid-19 has pushed the economy into the worst recession on record. GDP fell by a fifth in the three months to June, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/09/uk-to-fall-into-deepest-slump-on-record-with-worst-fall-in-gdp-among-g7">the biggest quarterly drop of any G7 nation</a>. This is surely the worst possible moment for the government to choose to inflict a further economic shock on the country. Yet that is exactly what Boris Johnson is planning to do. On 1 January, the Brexit transition period will come to an end and Britain will either trade on a no-deal basis with the European Union or, at best, with a bare-bones free trade agreement.</p><p>The government’s economic forecasts <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/760484/28_November_EU_Exit_-_Long-term_economic_analysis__1_.pdf">predict that a no-deal Brexit would depress GDP</a> by more than seven percentage points over 15 years and that a free trade deal outside the customs union and single market would reduce it by just under five points. But even Brexit’s most ardent proponents, who implausibly deny that creating friction in the trading relationship with our closest neighbours would significantly reduce growth over the long term, would concede that there will be a short-term shock to moving to a different relationship. It is a mark of just how mind-bogglingly ideological Johnson and his cabinet are that they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/09/britain-will-not-give-in-to-eu-fishing-demands-says-villiers">refused to ask the EU for the transition period extension</a> earlier this year that would surely have been granted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/06/the-observer-view-on-boris-johnsons-disastrous-path-to-a-covid-19-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

Whether Putin had prior knowledge of the plot, or personally authorised it, will probably never be known. As usual, the Kremlin is hiding behind a wall of denials and absurd claims, such as that Navalny fell ill after flying on an empty stomach. But his German doctors are unequivocal.
