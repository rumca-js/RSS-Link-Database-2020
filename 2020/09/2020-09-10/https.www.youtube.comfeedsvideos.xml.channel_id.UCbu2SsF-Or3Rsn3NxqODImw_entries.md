Ubisoft has finally shown off its new IP, Immortals Fenyx Rising, the title formerly known as Gods & Monsters. We recently had the chance to play a few hours of the game, and the immediate thing we noticed was that it contains a number of similarities to Nintendo’s beloved RPG The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

In a new video, Jess covers the many aspects of Immortals that you might find quite similar to Breath of the Wild. These include its bright open world, the feeling of player-driven freedom to explore, and the stamina and traversal systems. Immortals also has its own take on Zelda’s shrines, as well as fast-paced and flashy combat.

Immortals definitely has a number of surface differences compared to Breath of the Wild, but check out the full video above to see how it’s similar to Nintendo’s game.

Immortals is scheduled for release on December 3 for PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC. The game is also coming to the Xbox Series S/X and the PlayStation 5.

Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X: two very similar consoles, with a couple of big differences. Which one is right for you? The Generation Next team compare all the key criteria you need to be thinking about if you want to get a next generation Xbox.

Microsoft's next-generation of Xbox consoles have finally come into focus. Along with the previously announced Xbox Series X, the company will also have a cheaper alternative called the Xbox Series S available. Ordinarily, the difference between two versions of the same console creates distinct experiences, but this time around Microsoft has narrowed the power difference between the two to offer what is essentially the same next-gen gaming experience.

So, what are the differences, what do they mean, and which Xbox is the right one for you? Well, those are exactly the questions we answer on this episode of Generation Next. Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan talk through everything we know about consoles, highlight the key differences, and explain what impact each of the two consoles will have on the way you play games.

There's also a discussion of price points for both consoles. Microsoft is offering a monthly payment option for both the Series X and Series S. In most cases, this often means that you end up paying more in the long run, however, for the Xbox Series X and Series S, it actually works out cheaper to utilize the All Access purchase option. We explain why and how in the video, so you can make a smart and informed purchasing decision.

Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles. Make sure to check out previous episodes of the show on GameSpot and YouTube.

On September 9th, Activision held a Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War multiplayer preview event showing off the all-new Combined Arms mode. We were invited to a hands-on preview and were able to try it out! In this match, we play on the map "Armada"- a large daytime map with a fleet of ships. 

The new mode plays much like 2019's Modern Warfare's Ground War mode. Although the player count is smaller (12v12) the objective is the same- capture and hold down 5 points across the map. The first team to 400 points wins. The Armada map is one of the larger maps utilized for the Combined Arms game mode. It features zip lines, gunboats, and jet skis to get from ship to ship to reach the capture points. 

Activision also revealed weapon loadouts, perks, maps, and more. After his hands-on time with the game, we asked Michael Higham his thoughts on the gameplay, and whether or not it'll live up to Warzone. Be sure to check out our video to hear his thoughts. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War comes to PS4, Xbox One and PC on November 13th.
