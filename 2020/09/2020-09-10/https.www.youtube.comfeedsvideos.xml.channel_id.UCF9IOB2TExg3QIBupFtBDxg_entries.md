In my city Indore in India the situation is disastrous, In last 2 weeks I have at least heard from 80-100 known contacts like friends, my cousins and friends of friends being infected with covid. Just today my neighbour who lives just around 4-5 houses away died of covid. Worst situation I have seen till now in my city. Out of these 7 people have died. I think death rate is much higher than official numbers. Please everyone do take care I am also trying to stay home as much as possible.


India

Cases, + 95, 735 + 96,551 = 4.5 million

World’s fastest growth rate

Deaths + 1, 172 + 1,209 = 76,271

+1,000 for past 10 days

Tests, 1 million per day

Spreads to smaller towns and villages

Delhi, Pune, Mumbai and Chennai, worst-hit cities

UK

Covid-19 contact tracing app, 24th September

Pilot, highly effective when used alongside traditional contact tracing to identify contacts of those who have tested positive for coronavirus

Businesses including pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and cinemas, NHS QR code posters visible

Download posters now

NHS Test and Trace (England) 

https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/916559/test-and-trace-statistics-week-14.pdf

27 August and 02 September 

32,359 close contacts with someone who had tested positive

Where communication details were available, 79.4% were reached and asked to self- isolate

Taking into account all contacts identified, 69.2% were reached

PM briefing, 9th September

Hands – Face – Space – test

Universities not to send infected students home

500, 000 per day by end of October

The Rule of Six

Venues to keep contact details for 21 days

Mass testing (Moon Shot)

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3520

So far identify people who are positive

Identify negative allowing them to behave in a normal way

New types of scalable tests

Swabs, saliva

90 - 20 minutes

No measures therefore required, all events and venues could be on

Isolated people released

Pilot study, Salford

Indoor and outdoor venues

Test manufacture and distribution

Well rolled out by Christmas

Widespread by Spring 2021

Testing 10 m people a day

Everything would need to come together

SAGE Scientific Advisory Group for Emergences

100 billion cost

Ministers say technology does not yet exist

Test and trace better

False positives

At best 1% would be false positives

66 m population = 660,000 self-isolating per week

False negatives

Plus people with any symptoms still need to self-isolate

False sense of security

Birmingham

Population, 1.14 million

Cases, + 892 (past 7 days)

Previous 7 days, cases + 30

78.2 cases per 100,000

Patrick Valence

200 vaccines

8 in phase 3 trials

Good immune response, in elderly as well as younger people

6 vaccines booked for UK

Different types of vaccines

Manufacturing in UK for some

Next year sometime

Aerosol emission and superemission during human speech increase with voice loudness (Nature Scientific Reports)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38808-z

Coughing and sneezing, visible droplets + small ones

Visible, 50 micrometres upwards

Normal speech, just the small ones

One micrometre, invisible

Carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens

Particle emission during normal human speech, positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude)

Quite, low amplitude = 1 to 50 particles per second

Loud, high amplitude = 10 to 500 particles per second

Regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic)

Counting aloud from 1 to 100 releases at least 6 times as many particles as an individual cough

Singing, x 6 compared to normal speech

Speech superemitters

x 10

Small particles

Suspend in the air

Penetrate deeper

Applications

Normal speech 10 decibel range

Ambient noise in restaurants, 70 decibels

Quite zones in public spaces
