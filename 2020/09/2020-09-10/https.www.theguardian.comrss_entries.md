## Premier League: 10 things to look out for this weekend

<p>Chance for Arsenal’s Saliba to impress at Fulham, Ancelotti and Mourinho do battle and big-spending Chelsea face Brighton</p><p>A price of success is the fear of following it up with failure and a section of Liverpool fans are twitchy at a lack of new personnel. Kostas Tsimikas is the sole senior summer arrival and as back-up to Andy Robertson. There is also January signing Takumi Minamino, who will be required to build on cameo roles during last season’s run-in. That Rhian Brewster and Harry Wilson are being touted for sales also suggests Jürgen Klopp is parsing down the youngsters he feels can augment his squad. Tsimikas and Minamino cost £21m between them and the football finance guru Swiss Ramble has suggested Liverpool’s <a href="https://twitter.com/SwissRamble/status/1302855202089971713">parsimony is down to increased costs</a>. Fans yearn for Thiago Alcântara to freshen the midfield but that deal is by no means guaranteed. Does that point to a weakened Liverpool? Not necessarily since Klopp’s team had an easier Project Restart schedule than their peers, having exited the Champions League in March and had all but won the league by the time of resumption. Liverpool’s problem in early season may be rustiness but despite that lack of refreshment and Chelsea’s lavish spending, only Manchester City are likely to stop 19 league titles becoming 20. <strong>JB</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/11/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

On Tuesday, the health secretary gave a statement to the Commons in which he completely forgot why he was there and only revealed what he had meant to say about extending lockdown restrictions via leaks to journalists later that evening.</p><p>No matter. The following day, the prime minister gave <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/09/boris-johnson-lets-rip-another-demented-monologue-in-commons">a Downing Street press conference</a> in which he merely repeated all the things Matt Hancock had said on Twitter the night before. So there was something entirely predictable about Matt returning to the Commons on Thursday to repeat all the things he had meant to say on Tuesday but were already in the public domain thanks to his own Twitter leaks and the Boris Johnson press conference. It would surprise no one if No 10 were to hold another presser tomorrow to clarify what Hancock had said today.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/10/hancocks-breakdown-slides-westminster-even-more-through-the-looking-glass">Continue reading...</a>

When we got home I had blood tests before being transferred to Southampton general hospital, where it was confirmed I had leukaemia and needed six months of intensive chemotherapy treatment.</p><p>I was a young patient, but I was keen to know everything about my diagnosis and my consultants got used to my constant questioning.

But when it was real-life science happening to me, I found it fascinating.

## Hard Kill review – Bruce Willis logs out in ultra-basic tech thriller

Here’s Willis back in his familiar 21st-century guise of cheque-cashing frontman for tuppenny-ha’penny video-on-demand fare, drafted in to deliver terse exposition before ceding the screen to no-names with slightly more give in their knees. All evidence would suggest he spent more time than usual on this film set, albeit much of that lassoed to a chair with an extravagant snood to keep him cosy. As ex-Marine turned embattled CEO Donovan Chalmers, Willis is operating in that grey area between zero fuss and not much effort.</p><p>The main event is a nondescript shuffle around some hoary old cliches, strewn with abysmal dialogue and filmed by someone who has played a lot of first-person shooters. It transpires that Chalmers’ techno-whizz daughter (Lala Kent) has been kidnapped by international scourge named The Pardoner (Sergio Rizzuto), whose smash-the-system rhetoric, expressed in boring, sub-Dr Evil monologues, needs stomping out with privately sourced paramilitary force. The film’s stompers-in-chief are a buff platoon of kick-ass boys and girls led by erstwhile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2011/aug/08/desperate-housewives-getting-desperate">Desperate Housewives</a> gardener Jesse Metcalfe, shrugging blandly through the kind of role (alcoholic combat veteran with a bad back) Willis himself might have enlivened in happier times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/10/hard-kill-review-bruce-willis-jesse-metcalfe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A meticulous investigation exposes the shameful truths surrounding the UK’s homeless population</p><p>The reporting project that became this book began with a man called Tony, who froze to death in December 2017 in the back garden of the home in Lowestoft from which he had been evicted, bankrupt, a few months before. Learning of Tony’s story, Maeve McClenaghan began what became an 18-month project to record every instance in the UK of a person dying while homeless.</p><p>In 2018, according to the charity Crisis, there were around 12,000 people sleeping rough in England. A further 276,100 people were living in temporary accommodation, sofa-surfing with family and friends, or in tents, cars or on public transport. Even the government’s own, lower, estimates were scandalous, with 4,751 rough sleepers representing an increase of 169% on the year that David Cameron’s Conservative government came to power. In <em>No Fixed Abode,</em> McClenaghan sets out in meticulously researched detail the consequences of this crisis for its most marginalised victims.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/10/no-fixed-abode-by-maeve-mcclenaghan-review-how-rough-sleepers-die">Continue reading...</a>

By talking up no deal and expressing a willingness to flout international law, the Conservatives intend to bounce Brussels into a favourable agreement while torturing their Labour opponents. It is the Tories who have relitigated Britain’s rupture with the EU – despite coasting to victory with a commitment to “Get Brexit done”.</p><p>They know that if the airwaves are flooded with Labour’s angry reactions, their opponents can be easily portrayed, once again, as blocking Brexit altogether. They believe that their electoral coalition has little interest in international law.

<p>An extraordinary ‘nonfiction novel’ weaves a web of associations between the founders of quantum mechanics and the evils of two world wars </p><p>God does not play dice with the world, Albert Einstein famously declared, to which Benjamín Labatut would surely retort: perhaps not – but the devil does. In fact, Einstein himself had a lifelong <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/feb/24/einstein-got-it-philosophy-and-science-do-go-hand-in-hand">niggle of doubt about mathematics</a>, the discipline that we suppose keeps the Lord away from the gaming tables. How is it, he wondered, that an intellectual tool invented by humans can comprehend, account for and even manipulate so much of objective reality? That the physical world should be amenable to something we made up seemed to him suspect.</p><p>Is it perhaps that we register only as much of the world as our figurings can encompass? Wittgenstein had already conjectured that the limits of our language are the limits of our knowledge; could this be the case also, but more radically, with mathematics and the branches of science on which it is based? We see only that which we are capable of seeing: how much is beyond us?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/10/when-we-cease-to-understand-the-world-by-benjamin-labatut-review-the-dark-side-of-science">Continue reading...</a>

## The Broken Hearts Gallery review – smart romcom with a breakout star

<p>Geraldine Viswanathan stands out in this conventional but funny would-be romcom of the summer</p><p>Geraldine Viswanathan is a 25-year-old Australian actor and comedian of Indian descent who has appeared in a handful of movie-stealing supporting roles, including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/29/blockers-review-prom-night-comedy-as-parents-turn-sex-obstructors">Blockers</a> and The Package. Now comes a romcom vehicle for her leading actor talents, written and directed by Natalie Krinsky (whose script credits include <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/13/when-good-tv-goes-bad-how-gossip-girl-lost-its-nasty-streak">Gossip Girl</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/mar/14/women-who-work-how-shonda-rhimes-tv-shows-excel-in-the-workplace">Grey’s Anatomy</a>). The Broken Hearts Gallery was supposed to be the big romcom of the summer – a little something for the ladies while their beaux piled into Tenet, possibly. Finally arriving in cinemas this weekend, it is something of a letdown: a funny but conventional glossy romcom. But there is no messing with Viswanathan, who is undoubtedly the main attraction.</p><p>She plays funny and unfiltered Lucy, an art gallery assistant who has a quirky-stroke-creepy collection of mementos from past relationships cluttering her bedroom in a Brooklyn flatshare. She is dating her boss, Max (Utkarsh Ambudkar), an art-world poser whose studious man-bun is a dead giveaway to hidden shallows. After she makes a drunken show of herself at a work event, Lucy is hit with a double-whammy of getting fired and being dumped by Max. The plot is default romcom but Krinksy’s rams her script with smart-relatable lines. “I bet she has an amazing but crazy skincare routine,” whispers Lucy in awe after meeting Max’s impressive new doctor girlfriend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/10/the-broken-hearts-gallery-review-smart-romcom-with-a-breakout-star">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic has shown how a lack of solid statistics can be dangerous. But even with the firmest of evidence, we often end up ignoring the facts we don’t like. </p><p>By Tim Harford<br /></p><p>By the spring of 2020, the high stakes involved in rigorous, timely and honest statistics had suddenly become all too clear. A new coronavirus was sweeping the world. Politicians had to make their most consequential decisions in decades, and fast. Many of those decisions depended on data detective work that epidemiologists, medical statisticians and economists were scrambling to conduct. Tens of millions of lives were potentially at risk. So were billions of people’s livelihoods.</p><p>In early April, countries around the world were a couple of weeks into lockdown, global deaths passed 60,000, and it was far from clear how the story would unfold. Perhaps the deepest economic depression since the 1930s was on its way, on the back of a mushrooming death toll. Perhaps, thanks to human ingenuity or good fortune, such apocalyptic fears would fade from memory. Many scenarios seemed plausible. And that’s the problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/sep/10/facts-v-feelings-how-to-stop-emotions-misleading-us">Continue reading...</a>

The voice of the civil rights movement reflects on Martin Luther King, Donald Trump, racism and resilience<br /></p><p>Rutha Mae Harris has never been afraid to sing in front of a crowd. Even as a 22-year-old facing the 250,000 people who had gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in August 1963 for the historic march on Washington, she felt excited rather than scared. After all, at earlier protests, she had faced police pointing batons, fire hoses and even guns, and each time, when she sang, her terror faded away.</p><p>That day, when she began to sing, her voice flew out across the march as she belted out the opening words: “We shall not …” Immediately, the other Freedom Singers, as her group were known, joined in for their rendition of We Shall Not Be Moved.

<p>Pubs are the most inclusive of all possible spaces.

From next Monday, children in England will spend their days in classrooms of 30, but adults won’t be able to meet in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/08/coronavirus-gatherings-of-more-than-six-to-be-banned-in-england">groups of more than six</a>. Earlier in the season, childcare was reinstated before people were allowed to visit their families, throwing up the absurdity that you could have your mum round, but only if she was prepared to look after your two-year-old.</p><p>Nowhere, though, has been more divisive than the pub: how was it more important to reopen pubs than swimming pools? Why should drinkers take precedence over gym-goers? Lately, a really cruel anomaly has surfaced. Pregnant women are still not allowed to take a partner with them for scans and appointments, or even have someone with them for early labour, so you can go for a pint with your beloved, but you will be on your own when you first hear your baby’s heartbeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/booze-battles-how-the-pub-became-the-focus-for-pandemic-britains-culture-wars">Continue reading...</a>
