Kostas Tsimikas is the sole senior summer arrival and as back-up to Andy Robertson. There is also January signing Takumi Minamino, who will be required to build on cameo roles during last season\u2019s run-in. That Rhian Brewster and Harry Wilson are being touted for sales also suggests J\u00fcrgen Klopp is parsing down the youngsters he feels can augment his squad. Tsimikas and Minamino cost \u00a321m between them and the football finance guru Swiss Ramble has suggested Liverpool\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SwissRamble/status/1302855202089971713\">parsimony is down to increased costs</a>. Fans yearn for Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara to freshen the midfield but that deal is by no means guaranteed. Does that point to a weakened Liverpool? Not necessarily since Klopp\u2019s team had an easier Project Restart schedule than their peers, having exited the Champions League in March and had all but won the league by the time of resumption. Liverpool\u2019s problem in early season may be rustiness but despite that lack of refreshment and Chelsea\u2019s lavish spending, only Manchester City are likely to stop 19 league titles becoming 20. <strong>JB</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/11/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/11/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend", "date_published": "2020-09-10 23:01:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Treasury committee urges Sunak to rethink end to furlough scheme", "description": "<p>Report adds to pressure on chancellor to continue targeted support for struggling sectors</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Pressure has mounted on the government to rethink the decision to bring its wage subsidy scheme to an end next month after an influential group of MPs said Rishi Sunak should continue to provide targeted support to struggling sectors of the economy.</p><p>The Treasury selected committee said viable businesses would go to the wall unless they continued to receive support from the state and urged the chancellor to \u201ccarefully consider\u201d targeted extensions to the furlough scheme.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/11/treasury-committee-urges-sunak-to-rethink-end-to-furlough-scheme-chancellor-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/11/treasury-committee-urges-sunak-to-rethink-end-to-furlough-scheme-chancellor-coronavirus", "date_published": "2020-09-10 23:01:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Santa Fe rejects George RR Martin\u2019s request to build a 'castle' library", "description": "<p>More than 40 neighbors signed a letter urging the review board to reject the project saying that a prominent castle \u2018will be visible\u2019</p><p>Game of Thrones author George RR Martin won\u2019t be able to build a seven-sided, castle-style library at his compound in Santa Fe that drew objections from neighbors.</p><p>The city\u2019s Historic Districts Review Board on Tuesday denied a request to allow Martin to exceed the building height limit in the historic district where he lives, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported.

The following day, the prime minister gave <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/09/boris-johnson-lets-rip-another-demented-monologue-in-commons\">a Downing Street press conference</a> in which he merely repeated all the things Matt Hancock had said on Twitter the night before. So there was something entirely predictable about Matt returning to the Commons on Thursday to repeat all the things he had meant to say on Tuesday but were already in the public domain thanks to his own Twitter leaks and the Boris Johnson press conference. It would surprise no one if No 10 were to hold another presser tomorrow to clarify what Hancock had said today.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/10/hancocks-breakdown-slides-westminster-even-more-through-the-looking-glass\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/10/hancocks-breakdown-slides-westminster-even-more-through-the-looking-glass", "date_published": "2020-09-10 17:03:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "EU official says asylum policy impasse 'part of the problem' at Moria", "description": "<p>Ylva Johansson says EU working to reduce number of refugees and migrants on Greek islands</p><p>A senior EU official has said Europe\u2019s failure to agree a common migration and asylum policy was partly responsible for the \u201cunacceptable\u201d conditions at the Moria camp on Lesbos that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/09/thousands-need-aid-after-fire-destroys-europes-largest-refugee-camp\">burned to the ground this week</a>, leaving more than 12,000 people without shelter.</p><p>Ylva Johansson, the European commissioner for home affairs, said that when she took office in December 2019, the situation for 40,000 refugees and migrants living on Greek islands was \u201cunsustainable and unacceptable\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/eu-official-says-asylum-policy-impasse-part-of-the-problem-at-moria\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/10/eu-official-says-asylum-policy-impasse-part-of-the-problem-at-moria", "date_published": "2020-09-10 17:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Alan Minter, British boxing great who became world champion, dies aged 69", "description": "<ul><li>Minter claimed WBC and WBA middleweight titles in 1980</li><li>\u2018You\u2019ll always be a legend and a gentleman,\u2019 says Ricky Hatton</li></ul><p>The former world middleweight champion Alan Minter has died aged 69, the British Boxing Board of Control has announced.</p><p>Minter won Olympic bronze at Munich in 1972 and went on to capture the British and European middleweight titles before he was granted his opportunity to fight on the world stage.
