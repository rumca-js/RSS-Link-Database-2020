<p>The Observer revisits six theatre bosses appointed in 2019 to discuss the existential threat to their industry, and the fightback</p><p>Last summer, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/observer">Observer</a><em> </em>profiled a group of newly-appointed artistic directors – a fresh surge of talent taking its place at the top of six of our best-loved theatre companies. A notably diverse cohort, they were bursting with optimism and ideas for shaking up the industry. Our theatre critic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/susannahclapp">Susannah Clapp</a>, introducing the new talent, looked forward to seeing how they would transform the theatrical landscape – with the caveat that “it is hard, though, to guess what changes will be wrought”.</p><p>No one predicted the cataclysmic changes they would all have to reckon with in their first year. “Everyone would like to go back to ‘precedented’ times, wouldn’t they?” says Sean Foley, artistic director for Birmingham Rep, who had arrived full time at the theatre in February – only to shut it within a month. The job, he says, is certainly “not what I bargained for”; no one dreams of overseeing redundancies, after all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/27/theatre-artistic-directors-2020-terrible-year-pandemic-donmar-bush-highttide-paines-plough-battersea-arts-centre">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Ant and Dec, through the Rodham-Clintons, to the Knowles-Carters, some people work better when they’re part of a duo</p><p>There is something about the “power of two” in our culture, a unique, contained bond that can form between two people and generate a particular catalysing spark. We are fascinated by “odd couples” but not odd trios; we love watching double acts and obsess over Hollywood couples; so many great achievements seem to have been the work of dual partnerships: Lennon and McCartney; Marie and Pierre Curie; French and Saunders. But what is that something?</p><p>Perhaps one of the reasons I’m so drawn to duos like this is that I am not a natural collaborator. As a child, I ploughed my own furrow and was, I suspect, rather similar to Briony, the hero of Ian McEwan’s novel <em>Atonement</em>: “One of those children possessed by a desire to have the world just so.” Briony not only writes the play she puts on at the start, but designs the posters, programmes and tickets – and constructs the sales booth. Way to go, Briony! Well, up to a point. In my professional life I’ve had to learn to be collegiate. Television – and to a lesser extent the newspaper industry – relies on teamwork to get the programme to air or the paper to press.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/27/two-is-the-magic-number-why-are-we-fascinated-with-power-couples">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This documentary based on Thomas Piketty’s economics bestseller outlines the effects of unchecked capitalism, but its visual style is jarring</p><p><em>Capital in the </em><em>Twenty-First Century</em> is not so much a critique of capitalism as a critique of its corruption. In New Zealand film-maker Justin Pemberton’s documentary, French economist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/23/thomas-piketty-why-frances-rock-star-economist-still-wants-to-squeeze-the-rich">Thomas Piketty</a>’s sweeping 700-page book from 2013 is condensed into an illustrated lecture that runs under two hours. Piketty appears as a talking head, bolstered by a cast of lively academics and economists who analyse more than 300 years of social, political and economic change, showing how unchecked capitalism works to widen the gap between rich and poor.</p><p>That might seem obvious, but Pemberton and Piketty encourage viewers to think about the way the acquisition of capital has been packaged and sold to the middle classes as a social leveller destined to improve the quality of life for all. Not so when today the 1% that hold 70% of the world’s wealth remain a stark reminder of Britain’s 18th-century aristocrats, whose inherited land and wealth set them apart from the general public whose average life expectancy was just 17. It’s brisk, first-rate stuff, and not especially radical. I can see it being shown in schools.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/27/capital-in-the-twenty-first-century-review-justin-pemberton-thomas-piketty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amina Cain’s enigmatic debut novel follows a female writer’s path from the constraints of home and marriage to creative freedom</p><p><a href="https://aminacain.com/">Amina Cain</a>’s short debut novel is easy enough to outline. Vitória works as a cleaner in an art gallery until she marries a wealthy man and can dedicate more time to her writing. But the change in her material circumstances does not prove as transformative as she hoped.</p><p><em>Indelicacy</em>, though, is a thing of real delicacy, with a fine, distilled quality to the writing, every word precisely chosen, precisely placed. At first it seems almost too sparse, each chapter just a few pages, with Vitória as enigmatic and elusive as her surroundings. We’re in an unnamed country in an unnamed point in history. But there’s a slyness to Cain’s writing that cuts through, and makes the tale increasingly engrossing. By the end, you walk in step with her heroine as she finds her own path towards freedom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/27/indelicacy-by-amina-cain-review-a-room-of-her-own">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Old Vic, London</strong><br />Michael Sheen, Indira Varma and David Threlfall are magnificent in Matthew Warchus’s enthralling livestreamed production of Brian Friel’s 1979 play</p><p>Does faith healing come about thanks to the faith of the healer, or the faith of the healed, or through faith in faith itself? This question haunts “the fantastic Francis Hardy, Faith Healer, One Night Only”, as his publicity poster presents him; it troubles his wife, Grace, and perplexes Teddy, his manager. Brian Friel’s 1979 play places the audience, too, in a state of doubt. Over the course of four separate soliloquies, these three characters build conflicting impressions of their relationships and their village hall tours of Wales and Scotland. Their slippery accounts do not tally. Only a few features hold firm: place names, a couple of events – and the act of questioning. Are the characters misremembering or deliberately misleading? Who and what should – can – we believe, or believe in?</p><p>In our own destabilising times, the Old Vic’s “scratch” production is itself an expression of faith – part of <a href="https://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2020/old-vic-in-camera">a season of performances</a> played on stage before an empty auditorium and simultaneously livestreamed to an audience that must pay to Zoom in.

<p>As one who resists technological change, I think we should defend the telly that took out a Welsh village’s internet</p><p>The mystery of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/22/the-old-telly-that-brought-down-a-welsh-villages-broadband">disappearing Welsh broadband</a> has been solved. I don’t know what you’d expect the broadband signal to be like in the isolated village of Aberhosan in Powys. Personally, I’d expect it to be terrible. And it really was terrible. But it seems the villagers didn’t expect that. To them, this was a mystery.</p><p>My low expectations of data flow to rural areas will doubtless offend some. I apologise: it may be outdated but I mean it nicely. It’s not a slur on the countryside. Not being able to access the internet is a plus as far as I’m concerned. I look back fondly on the afternoon in 2009 on the Isle of Skye that I spent waving a Samsung flip phone around my head in the hope of it coinciding with a big enough blob of reception to get a text to send. I was significantly more likely to catch a flying splat of seagull shit. But the inconvenience makes you feel remote and, for me, that was the point of going there. Nowadays, I could probably get streaming HD. Which sounds like a disease. And maybe it is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/27/so-an-ancient-tv-set-can-bring-down-the-mighty-broadband-good">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A policy designed to open up the planning system has left thousands in tiny flats, far from schools and shops. And with more deregulation coming, things will get worse<br /></p><p>“I can’t work” says Katya. One reason she can’t work is that it takes her 40 minutes to walk to the nearest available school from her housing block in Harlow, Essex, and 40 minutes back, which means that she spends the best part of three hours every day ferrying her young children to and fro. Shops are also a long walk away, apart from a petrol station where you can buy milk and bread for above-average prices. She can’t afford broadband or the devices that access it. “We are really isolated.”</p><p>Her flat is small – “if you open the door you hit the bed” – freezing in winter, boiling in summer, and prone to mould. Being on the ground floor, she doesn’t dare open her windows at night. There have been drug dealing and knife fights in her block. There is “always shouting and arguing”, she says. “The children are frightened.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/27/housing-crisis-planning-converting-office-blocks-homes-catastrophe-jenrick">Continue reading...</a>

## Walking in an autumn wonderland: how I found awe in deepest Surrey

<p>A scientific study shows the benefits of feeling small in the grand scheme of things. An ‘awe walk’ on Surrey’s Leith Hill helped one sceptic see the light</p><p>Why am I standing on the edge of the second-highest point in south-east England?

<p>He thought he was washed up before he’d started. Now, using politicians’ words against them, Michael Spicer is part of a new wave of satirists finding success outside TV</p><p>Michael Spicer has been trying – mostly failing – to make it as a comedian for the best part of two decades. As a teenager, Spicer amassed enough rejection letters to wallpaper the spare bedroom of his family home. (He was a precocious teenager.) Spicer kept plugging away at comedy writing throughout his 20s and 30s, pitching to TV commissioners but receiving unending rejections. “A lot of the stuff I wrote wasn’t quite good enough,” he admits. It wasn’t that Spicer wasn’t getting anywhere at all – “I would always touch the surface of success,” he says – but he certainly wasn’t getting anywhere fast.</p><p>Parts in BBC satirical comedy <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/14/seriously-funny-political-comedians-mash-report-nish-kumar" title="">The Mash Report</a></em>, hosted by Nish Kumar, and the Diane Morgan sitcom <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/aug/13/mandy-review-from-naked-sushi-model-to-tarantula-assassin" title="">Mandy</a></em> were promising, but they weren’t enough to make ends meet, so Spicer took a job writing copy for a shipping company.

<p>The Labour leader’s first party conference speech sought to extinguish Corbynism with a promise of ‘never again’ </p><p>The new leader had taken charge of the party after a catastrophic defeat. He was not yet sure how much Labour would have to change if it were to see power again, and he knew every step would be greeted by howls of betrayal from some on the left, but he understood that change it must. So in his first leader’s speech to the party conference, he chose to make the assembled activists relive the trauma of their election loss. “Remember how you felt on that dreadful morning of 10 June. Just remember how you felt, and think to yourselves, ‘June the ninth, 1983; never ever again will we experience that.”</p><p>That compelling passage of Neil Kinnock’s oratory, delivered in Brighton in that distant age when party conferences were held at the seaside rather than in cyberspace, came to mind as I listened to Sir Keir Starmer delivering his<a href="https://labour.org.uk/press/full-text-of-keir-starmers-speech-at-labour-connected/"> leader’s speech</a> to Labour’s virtual conference.

<p>Artist Claerwen James on growing up with an extraordinary father – and how she bonded with him in his final months when they compiled an anthology of his favourite verse</p><p>Ten months before his death last year at the age of 80, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/nov/27/clive-james-obituary">Clive James</a> underwent an eight-hour operation to remove a tumour on his face. Already very frail – he had been suffering from leukaemia for a decade – afterwards it took him almost a week to emerge fully into consciousness. “And even then, he was foggy,” says his daughter, the artist Claerwen James. “He couldn’t really see, which meant he couldn’t really read – and that had never been the case before.” For her father, this was not a small thing, whatever the size of his other problems. Words were his life raft. </p><p>But all was not lost. “The resource that he did have was the poetry he knew,” she says. “And he wanted to hear it. He’d recite a bit – sometimes, he’d have only a verse – and whoever was sitting with him would look up the next part, and read it to him. He loved this, and then he would often say a little about it. He’d tell us when he had first heard the poem, or point out which bit was most difficult to say.” Together, he and his readers got into a rhythm. “We started writing down all the poems he wanted to hear, and the relevant anecdotes, and in this way a manuscript began to emerge without him willing it.” If this felt at the time like a small miracle, it was also, in context, perfectly ordinary: “He was always working on something. There was literally never a moment when he wasn’t – and now, there was this. A pile of poems.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/sep/27/he-returned-to-what-he-really-was-clive-jamess-daughter-on-his-poetic-farewell">Continue reading...</a>

Now these images have caused the postponement of a major retrospective to honour him – and a heated row within the art world.</p><p>Four institutions – the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Tate in London – have said their Philip Guston Now exhibition won’t open before 2024 because it needs to be framed by “additional perspectives and voices”. They want to wait until the “message of social and racial justice” at the centre of his work “can be more clearly interpreted”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/26/sense-or-censorship-row-over-klan-images-in-tates-postponed-show">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She runs from bees and hates planes. But with acting, Sarah Paulson is scared of nothing. She talks about her roles in American Horror Story and Ratched – and about her ‘creative marriage’ with screenwriter Ryan Murphy</p><p>I got a report yesterday saying it was up by…” Sarah Paulson pauses, weighing up whether she wants to reveal the extent of her daily screen time. Then she takes the plunge. “It was nine hours and 52 minutes,” she says, mock-abashed. In a <em>day</em>? She nods. “In a day, yes. Quite terrible. I think it was… doesn’t it break down how much of it was work? There was work on there. So I was doing some of that. But… it’s embarrassing.”</p><p>We are at the start of another long screen day for Paulson, who is speaking from her kitchen, at home in Los Angeles. Her new dog, Winifred, is curled up just out of shot. “Winnie! Would you like to come and say hi?” she coos, in a squeaky voice. “I’m <em>this</em> person! Who does this voice when I talk to my dog!” Winnie is her first dog in nine-and-a-half years; she has the initials of her old dogs, Alice and Millie, tattooed on the inside of her wrist. “She’s very demanding and she has a lot of personality. She’s recently taken to humping me. She’s my child! Why is she doing this, this 11-month-old, precious little thing? I can’t tell you how upsetting it is. She’s not even 8lb.

<p>Paul Graham captured early-80s Britain in his colour photographs of people and places along the A1</p><p>Paul Graham took this photograph nearly 40 years ago as part of his first serious photographic project, a road trip along the A1, the Great North Road, from its beginning at the Bank of England to its end at the central post office in Edinburgh. Graham was 25. As a child, his family’s annual holidays had begun with an overnight journey up Britain’s ancient spine, with its evocative junctions – Comet Roundabout, Selby Fork and Scotch Corner – and “to an impressionable five-year-old, travelling up the Great North Road seemed a close contender to visiting the moon”.</p><p>By 1981, that romance had dimmed. The Romans’ time-honoured route north had long been usurped by the M1 motorway. Graham was, like far too many young men that year, unemployed. He revisited the road in a Morris Mini Traveller, borrowed from his partner’s grandmother. He had two rules: “not to photograph as though this was an American road trip and not to take images from a moving car window”. This picture, one of several taken in cafes and service stations along the route, was characteristic of Graham’s emerging visual language – the blue work-clothes of the men had them vanish quietly into the slabs of colour on the glossed walls. The orange formica of the 1950s shouted something bleaker than retro.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/sep/27/the-big-picture-cafe-culture-on-the-road">Continue reading...</a>

<p>That sun-soaked pause in life triggered nostalgia for many, says Mariella Frostrup. If it’s a real relationship you want focus on one driven by current connection</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong></em>An acquaintance I didn’t know very well from 15 years ago added me on Facebook last year, then over lockdown asked for my number and started texting. He had split from his wife last year and moved out. The messaging became quite frequent and he indicated on several occasions that he was interested in meeting up. It definitely seemed that he wanted to be more than just friends. We were getting to know each other, and I started to think he was a nice guy and was considering meeting. We had a few things in common and have the same sense of humour.</p><p>Suddenly things started to cool off. In the space of a week he stopped initiating texts, although he did reply in a friendly but distant way if I messaged him first. He still “likes” my posts. I’m completely confused. Do I forget him? Wait and see if he wants to meet at some point in the future? Should I assume he’s met someone else? Looking back, I don’t think I did or said anything off-putting. We are both in our 40s, so I wasn’t expecting this. This is all a bit of a head wreck!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/27/the-man-who-texted-me-during-lockdown-has-now-gone-quiet-mariella-frostrup">Continue reading...</a>
