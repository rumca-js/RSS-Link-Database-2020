Here's how the Series X loading times stack up to an Xbox One X. Tested on Red Dead Redemption 2, Control, Outer Worlds, and FFXV.

Xbox Series X features faster loading times than its predecessor the Xbox One X, and the difference between the two systems is extremely impressive. We were able to go hands-on with the two systems and compare their loading times across Red Dead Redemption 2, Control, The Outer Worlds, and Final Fantasy XV. See for yourself how much less time youâ€™ll spend waiting on loading screens and how much more you can spend playing games. Once we have access to games that are releasing with Xbox Series X versions, weâ€™ll have to see how they compare, as well.

Koei Tecmo held a 50-minute presentation at TGS 2020 showing off new gameplay and info for Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, so we compiled some of the key details we learned that you may have missed.

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity was revealed just a few weeks ago and is coming out in November. Ahead of its release, Koei Tecmo held a live-stream during TGS 2020 to reveal some new information on the game, show off 13 minutes of brand new gameplay, and unveil Impa as a playable character.

But we uncovered some other info that may not have been as clear, such as details on how the Sheikah Slate might work between characters in gameplay, minor characters that might become playable, and how Age of Calamity connects to both Breath of the Wild and the original Hyrule Warriors.

Age of Calamity is both a spin-off and prequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and itâ€™s set to release on November 20 exclusively for Nintendo Switch.

Itâ€™s time to see how Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold Warâ€™s larger 12 v 12 game mode Combined Arms stacks up against Modern Warfare's 32 v 32 Ground War.Â  

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War released a surprise alpha on PS4 after it was announced at the PlayStation 5 Showcase. Being massive fans of Modern Warfare's big team battle mode, Ground War, we spent our time playing Cold War's Combined Arms mode. Although Combined Arms has 24 players versus Ground War's larger 64 player count, we found plenty of similarities and differences to talk about. Some of those include how the games handle their maps, spawning troubles, vehicle versus infantry balance, scorestreaks versus killstreaks, and what needs polish going into Cold War's final build. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes multiplayer mechanics away from the mil-sim and sandbox direction of Modern Warfare and towards earlier Black Ops gunfight fundamentals. Cold War is set in the 1980s with weapons themed around that time. Cold War had some larger maps in the alpha including a naval-based one called Armada and a frozen map called Crossroads. These maps contain a mix of gunboats, jet skis, tanks, and snowmobiles. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13 for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will not have a season pass but will have a Battle Pass system. Cold War supports cross-save, cross-play, and cross-generation play, and will tie into Call of Duty: Warzone.
