Headache and Fatigue 

Dark Horses of COVID Symptoms

Most commonly experienced early symptoms are:

Headache, 82%

Fatigue 72%

This is the case for all age groups

9% of COVID-positive adults aged 18 - 65 didn’t experience headache or fatigue

1% of people who reported fatigue and/or headache tested positive for COVID

3% of people who tested positive had headache and fatigue alone

Therefore

Having either or both of those symptoms alone is unlikely to be indicative of COVID.

The Classic Three are Still Key

Cough, fever, loss of smell

40% of all age groups, fever in the first seven days

CDC, Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report

Changing Age Distribution of the COVID-19 Pandemic — United States, May–August 2020 (23rd September)

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/pdfs/mm6939e1-H.pdf

Early in the pandemic, COVID-19 incidence was highest among older adults 

June–August 2020

Incidence highest, 20–29 years

Accounted for less than 20% of all confirmed cases

Younger adults likely contribute to community transmission

Southern United States, June 2020

Increases in percentage of positive test results among adults aged 20–39

Increases among those aged more than 60 4–15 days later 

Therefore

Strict adherence to community mitigation strategies

Personal preventive behaviours by younger adults

Reduce infection and subsequent transmission to persons at higher risk for severe illness.

Im getting lots of queries about how I record my videos, O do hope this helps, John

This method uses standard computer, video and microphone components. There is no need to spend a lot of money on a ‘dedicated’ studio system.

We're using a video camera pointing at a desk with a hdmi cable going into an elgato capture USB3 device - the HD 60 S.

The downward looking camera is mounted in a retort stand with a clamp, like in any chemistry lab.

Then the 2nd video is from a 1080p logitech Webcam. However, any video camera with do, use an HDMI to USB cable. Plug this into the HDMI out, in the camera.

Both devices are feeding into OBS (free software) before being recorded using the nvenc capabilities of a nvidia gtx 960 graphics card.

This is very similar to what the twitch.tv streamers are doing for their gaming sessions. 

The microphone is a usb "blue yeti" microphone, also gets recorded using OBS.

Of course less expensive microphones would also work.

Any editing (which I try to avoid as it takes ages) after this is done using Adobe premiere elements.
