Two early-phase trials

2 doses

n = 76 

Open-label

Non-randomised

Healthy adult volunteers (men and women) aged 18–60 

Phase 3 needed, randomised, blinded, placebo controlled

Sputnik V

Two formulations (frozen and lyophilised) 

21 days, antibody in all

28 days, T-cell response in all

42 days, good safety profile

Mild local and systemic side effects

No serious adverse events were detected 

Two-part vaccine, two attenuated recombinant adenovirus vectors

Carrying the gene for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein

Approval already granted in Russia

Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Viral Shedding in Pediatric Patients Infected With Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Under the Surface (JAMA 28 
August)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2770149

South Korea Children data

22% asymptomatic for entire course of infection

20% began asymptomatic but later developed symptoms

58% symptomatic

Length of time children remained symptomatic, 3 days to 3 weeks

Probably contagious for longer times

SARS-CoV-2 viral load predicts COVID-19 mortality, (Lancet, August, NY) 

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30354-4/fulltext#%20

SARS-CoV-2 viral load at diagnosis, independent predictor of mortality

In a large hospitalised prospective cohort 

n=1,145

adjusted for age, sex, asthma, atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension, stroke, race

Significant independent association between viral load and mortality

Hospitalised testing needs to change from qualitative to quantitative

Cases, weekly + 6,732 

Highest since May

Up 6% on week before

Contacts reached, down to 69.4% from 77.1%.

High cases, low deaths

(Dr. Andrew Bayliff)

‘First wave’

Most testing hospital based

Patients presenting with relatively severe symptoms

Self-selecting sample

Biased towards older patients with comorbidities

Most positive cases never tested, therefore undiagnosed

Many asymptomatic and mild cases

‘Current wave’

Much more testing

Many via track and trace

Therefore picking up a representative sample of the total infected population

Mortality rates for recent ‘cases’ will be biased more towards the statistically true outcomes

i.e. the true IFR
 
Testing rate is more than x100 from the early weeks

 ‘chalk and cheese’

‘apples and oranges”

Q and A

Will this vaccine change my DNA?


Contact tracing apps can sharply reduce the spread of Covid-19 even when only a few people use them

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184135v1.full.pdf

Non-pharmaceutical interventions 

Google and Oxford University

An app used by 15% of the population

Together with a well-staffed contact-tracing workforce

Can lead to a 15% drop in infections

And an 11% drop in deaths

Google and Apple.

Bluetooth signals

Anonymously notifies a person if someone they met contracts Covid-19

Past few weeks

Six US states

Two dozen countries

No major hitches

Thailand
First locally transmitted case in 100 days
Prison inmate was diagnosed
Dozens of contacts are now being tested
Arrested for drug offences on 26 August
