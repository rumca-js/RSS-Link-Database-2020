<p>Manager is delighted to be with his players for the first time since November and looking forward to the double-header with Iceland and Denmark</p><p>Gareth Southgate admits that he questioned himself. Which foot does Mason Greenwood, one of the new call-ups to his England squad, prefer to use? “I feel slightly embarrassed,” the England manager said with a smile. “You’ve picked a player for England and you’re not sure which foot he kicks the ball with.”</p><p>For the record, Greenwood says that he just about favours the left, although his comfort with the right is part of what makes the Manchester United forward such a special talent. “The way he’s got this icy-cold stare and a very calm disposition generally … I think that’s clear when he’s in and around the penalty box and for somebody of his age, that’s remarkable maturity,” Southgate added.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/04/gareth-southgate-relishes-englands-blend-of-youthful-joy-and-senior-nous">Continue reading...</a>

## For Lionel Messi and Barcelona things will never be the same again | Sid Lowe

<p>There are no winners after the Argentinian superstar was bluntly honest in saying he is only staying to avoid court</p><p>No smile, no handshake and no reconciliation. Lionel Messi is staying at Barcelona but this was no happy ending. It is over, for now, yet there is no real closure and no one truly got what they wanted, maybe not even Josep Maria Bartomeu. A survivor clinging to power, he will no longer preside over the departure of the best player in the club’s history but nor will he evade responsibility for it. His victory, if that is what this was, is hollow one. Messi made sure of that.</p><p>The prospect of his leaving after 20 years at Barcelona was sad and has been avoided for nine months but that was never the worst part. The worst part was that it had got to the point he <a href="https://web.archive.org/italics" title=""><em>wanted</em></a> to leave; that things were so bad, so broken, he would turn his back on it all. And that remains; it has not been fixed by Messi staying, still less by Bartomeu surviving. “I wanted to be happy,” Messi said, “and I didn’t find happiness at the club.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/04/for-lionel-messi-and-barcelona-things-will-never-be-the-same-again">Continue reading...</a>

## Padrenostro review – a deep dive into a director’s subconscious

<p>Claudio Noce’s very personal picture is a beautiful mess that views the harsh adult world from a child’s perspective</p><p>As a child in the 1970s, writer-director Claudio Noce stood in the wings while a leftwing terrorist group – the Armed Proletarian Cells – targeted his father, Rome’s deputy chief of police. The trauma, he says, harried him all his life before finally finding a catharsis of sorts with the making of Padrenostro, which competes for the top prize here in Venice. This, Noce’s third feature, marks his moment of unburdening. Unsurprisingly, then, it’s a personal picture, agonised and self-questioning, almost to a fault.</p><p>Noce’s alter-ego is Valerio (Mattia Garaci), an angelic-looking 10-year-old with a low-grade heart murmur and a penchant for solitary walks and wild flights of fancy. But his immediate surroundings feel horribly real. Wounded in an assassination attempt, his father Alfonso (Pierfrancesco Favino) now carries a handgun in his bag and flinches every time the front doorbell rings. Valerio isn’t sure what has happened or why, which naturally means that we’re in the dark, too. For most of its run, Padrenostro elects to view the harsh adult world from a child’s perspective. It’s like What Maisie Knew crossed with a supergrass gangster film.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/04/padrenostro-review-claudio-noce-venice-film-festival">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on plastics: reducing bag use is not enough | Editorial

<p>As the oil industry plans a big increase in the manufacture of packaging, the need for international action on waste has never been clearer </p><p>From shocking footage of an albatross chick <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3ddrZCyXkz37jtyb71K0nc4/filming-albatross-chicks-eating-plastic" title="">killed by a plastic toothpick</a> to images <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/03/ocean-cleanup-device-successfully-collects-plastic-for-first-time" title="">of the Great Pacific Garbage Patch</a>, and recent coverage of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/26/littering-epidemic-england-countryside-code" title="">increase in litter</a> left behind by visitors to the British countryside during the pandemic, there is no shortage of evidence of the harm and ugliness caused by plastic. Public awareness of the problem has grown rapidly over recent years in many countries, and led to new legislation. But while environmental organisations work hard to highlight links between the plastics and oil industries – and while pollution of the oceans and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/oct/18/uk-recycling-industry-under-investigation-for-and-corruption" title="">failures by the waste and recycling industry</a> have become key themes for campaigners – the issue of plastics is still not widely enough recognised as a consequence of our dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p>Reports of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/04/war-on-plastic-could-strand-oil-industrys-300bn-investment" title="">plans by the oil industry</a> to expand the supply of virgin plastics by a quarter over five years, while <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/kenya-plastic-oil-industry-lobbies-us" title="">putting pressure on countries such as Kenya</a> to lift restrictions on their use, show how urgently this needs to change. Plastics are not a byproduct of the fossil fuel industry. They are a product of it. The expansion of plastics manufacturing, on which companies including Saudi Aramco and Royal Dutch Shell plan to spend about $400bn (£300bn), is part of the industry’s coordinated response to the reduced demand for fuel brought about by the shift to renewable energy and electric vehicles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/04/the-guardian-view-on-plastics-reducing-bag-use-is-not-enough">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More and more, the president voices contempt for the voting process. Imagine what he’d do if re-elected</p><p>This is not a normal election. I don’t say that because it is now clear that, against some stiff competition, Donald Trump is the most repellent individual ever to have sought, let alone won, the presidency of the United States. The latest proof comes in a quadruple-sourced account of Trump describing US troops who died for their country as “losers” and “suckers”, and demanding that a military parade exclude wounded veterans, lest spectators glimpse an amputee. “Nobody wants to see that,” he said.</p><p>There was a time when the Atlantic’s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/09/trump-americans-who-died-at-war-are-losers-and-suckers/615997/">jaw-dropping report</a>, later <a href="https://twitter.com/cmarinucci/status/1301695780344872964?s=20">corroborated</a> “in its entirety” by the Associated Press, would have proved terminal for a politician in a country where respect for the military supposedly has the status of a religious obligation.

<p>After more than a decade of writing life-changing advice, I know when to move on. Here’s what else I learned<br /></p><p>In the very first instalment of my column for the Guardian’s Weekend magazine, a dizzying number of years ago now, I wrote that it would continue until I had discovered the secret of human happiness, whereupon it would cease. Typically for me, back then, this was a case of facetiousness disguising earnestness. Obviously, I never expected to find the secret, but on some level I must have known there were questions I needed to confront – about anxiety, commitment-phobia in relationships, control-freakery and building a meaningful life. Writing a column provided the perfect cover for such otherwise embarrassing fare. </p><p>I hoped I’d help others too, of course, but I was totally unprepared for how companionable the journey would feel: while I’ve occasionally received requests for help with people’s personal problems, my inbox has mainly been filled with ideas, life stories, quotations and book recommendations from readers often far wiser than me. (Some of you would have been within your rights to charge a standard therapist’s fee.)

Ask a whisky distiller and they’ll tell you it’s in the quality of the water, pure and simple. The gin distillers will say the wildflowers and ancient herbs that thrive in Scotland’s wilderness make the perfect botanicals. Drambuie brewers will get specific; it’s the herby bristles of heather that bruise the wild hillsides.</p><p>With a cold climate putting a damper on viticulture, and an untamed landscape on their doorstep, Scots have always had to be inventive with their alcohol. This has created a drink scene in Edinburgh like no other, using ancient recipes with the natural bounty of Scotland’s countryside to resurrect forgotten spirits and concoct new cocktails. The cold months inspire warming spirits to go with that famous Scottish hospitality, making Edinburgh the perfect playground to raise a glass this autumn and beyond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-edinburgh-staycation-guide/2020/sep/04/whisky-gin-and-fruit-wines-five-of-edinburghs-best-local-tipples">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PS4, Xbox One, PC; Vicarious Visions/Activision</strong><br />The legendary skateboarding sim is back in a brilliant rerelease that offers a portal to the past</p><p>Skateboarding has often been misunderstood and misrepresented. To a degree, that’s part of its appeal. To skate is to exist out of step with traffic and pedestrians, moving through urban spaces in a way that architects and town planners never intended and reinventing mundane blocks of concrete as a canvas for play and creativity. It is a subculture as much as a sport, but skateboarding is also a welcoming home for misfits.</p><p>So many adverts and music videos that clumsily riff on skating have failed to understand what the sport is about. But in 1999, a PlayStation game came along that did more than translate the mechanics of skateboarding into superb gameplay. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater offered a portal to the subculture. It understood what it was to be part of skateboarding, to the point it felt near-documentary. The game was authentic yet accessible, welcoming <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/sep/04/tony-hawks-pro-skater-playstation-games-skateboarding">a new generation to skateboarding</a> while making household names of Hawk and his peers. Along with its sequel, it also had a tremendous influence on game design. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/04/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-review-skateboarding-ps4-xbox-one-pc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Waiting for our pup to arrive has been disappointing for the boys, who assumed you order one from Amazon<br /></p><p>A while ago, my wife and I took the kids to an agricultural fair, which is like a regular trade fair except you spend £30 on chilli jam and pretend to a salesman that you are going to come back and look at a ride-on mower again, even though you have plastic grass (more of that in another column).</p><p>Part way through the day, we went into a barn full of people selling rabbits. It is difficult to believe we haven’t tampered with these animal breeds when they all look so cute you feel that you’ve walked into a Pixar film. This is great for selling rabbits, but absolutely unacceptable for somebody innocently walking through there with kids. The boys immediately fell in love with them, and started demanding we get one. I explained to them how irresponsible it was to go somewhere expecting to buy some fudge, and return with livestock. They were still insistent, at which point I looked to my wife for help, only to find her making a face like Puss in Boots from Shrek. She had defected to the other side and wanted a rabbit, too. I explained to all of them that we needed a bit more time to think about this, and decide which animal we could actually commit to, if any. They demanded assurances that we would definitely get a pet; the only way I could get away from the fair bunny-free was to agree. We eventually decided on a dog.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/04/getting-dog-avoid-trap-of-talking-about-it-all-the-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A dress that didn’t get as many sun-dappled paella lunches as it deserved this year is the perfect basis for an early autumn outfit</p><p>Change is good. This is kind of the whole premise of fashion, when you think about it. It’s an investment in where we go from here. And here we are at the first weekend in September, the most important all-change moment in the fashion calendar. Traditionally, this is when we put our summer wardrobes away and hit the shops for an autumn refresh.</p><p>But change in 2020 has taken place on a supersized scale. In an age of titanic upheaval, it doesn’t feel to me like a true reflection of the zeitgeist to be talking about how sage green is the new blush pink, or chorister collars are the new polo necks, or whatever. This is a moment for fashion to step up and change at a more fundamental level.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/04/how-to-autumn-proof-your-summer-dress">Continue reading...</a>

And there is heightened concern that the US Postal Service will not be able to deliver ballots in a timely manner because of poor management by the new Trump-appointed postmaster, and chronic underfunding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/04/election-voting-guide-voter-rights">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Humanity is fighting an invisible enemy, with no end in sight … the epic battle between humans and Cylons, now back on our screens, still holds up as prescient, brilliant television</p><p>Earth, 2020: humanity faces an existential threat and, perhaps even worse, a slowdown in our TV content pipeline. So the BBC iPlayer box set debut of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a> (BSG) – a mid-00s reimagining of Glen A Larson’s 1978 disco-ball space opera – should be a cause for celebration. The initial 2003 miniseries depicts a thriving colonial space empire reduced to a rag-tag fleet of just 50,000 stricken souls, the result of a brutal terror attack orchestrated by a race of AI constructs rebelling against their human creators. How to survive in a state of seemingly perpetual crisis is BSG’s central, and regrettably timely, theme.</p><p>As well as featuring cool space dogfights with Cylon killbots and their inglorious Basestars, this hard-boiled sci-fi series asks thorny questions about the rights and wrongs of armed insurrection, and who or what should be sacrificed in order to avoid extinction. The push-and-pull relationship between the veteran military commander Adama (Edward James Olmos from Blade Runner, gravelly as all hell) and the fast-tracked new president, Roslin (Mary McDonnell), is also coloured by the fact that certain Cylons can pass for humans, creating a nervy background hum of paranoia. With such elevated stakes, no wonder a new sci-fi swearword – the versatile “frak!” – is so essential to the project.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/04/battlestar-galactica-all-hail-a-cult-classic-of-21st-century-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Although Portugal remains on the safe list, for English tourists at least, rumours to the contrary spark panic and holiday cancellations</p><p>Noel Josephides sounds weary. Two weeks ago when the UK government added Portugal to the travel corridor list, the chairman of Sunvil issued a statement saying he was delighted to start selling holidays to Portugal again, “just in time for the last couple of weeks of the peak summer season, but also in time for the glorious autumnal months of September and October, right into November”.</p><p>By the beginning of this week the rumour was that the country’s brief spell as a “safe destination” was about to come to an end as coronavirus cases in the country went above 20 per 100,000 people – the level at which the UK government considers triggering quarantine conditions. On Tuesday, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/01/uk-ambassador-to-portugal-warns-travel-rules-can-change-quickly">UK ambassador to Portugal fuelled speculation</a> that the country would soon revert to the quarantine list when he warned that air bridges can “change quickly”. The hint that the 20 August decision could be reversed was enough to unsettle British holidaymakers in Portugal and spark a rush to get back to the UK before the dreaded deadline. EasyJet sold out of all its flights from Faro, which serves the Algarve, to airports in Britain on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/sep/04/government-flip-flopping-on-quarantine-list-destroying-portuguese-tourist-industry">Continue reading...</a>

It’s an unusual way to spend a Monday night, especially in rural Devon.

Beavers, iron age pigs,<strong> </strong>mouflon (wild sheep), Heck cattle and Exmoor ponies also live on this 120-hectare farm near Lifton, owned by rewilding specialist and farmer Derek Gow.</p><p>This unassuming old dairy farm with its small whitewashed barns is a hub for covert species reintroductions. In 1995, Gow started working with water voles – his first species of interest – after buying a batch from a fish farm in Hampshire. Then he noticed restored wetlands were naturally silting up and realised another keystone species was missing: beavers. Bereft of beavers, ponds require huge amounts of management to keep them open, so in 1997 he drove to Poland to get some.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/04/its-going-to-be-our-way-now-the-guerrilla-rewilder-shaking-up-british-farming-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As quarantine rules and coronavirus fears jeopardised trips abroad, photographer Alex McBride sought out the Britons exploring their own isles<br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>With summer drawing to a close, people across the country are looking back through their holiday photos feeling perhaps a little less rested than they had done in previous years. Mercurial changes in the government’s travel corridor list have caused lots of holidaymakers to repatriate prematurely to UK shores in an effort to avoid quarantine restrictions. Many more chose not to leave the UK at all, and in July there was an 87% slump in demand for European flights compared with the same month last year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/04/surf-and-turf-how-britons-holiday-at-home-coronavirus-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artist <a href="https://www.sarahgillespie.co.uk/editions/moth/">Sarah Gillespie’s</a> prints of moths represent the culmination of an 18 months-long project designed to attract attention to the plight of the insect, whose numbers have dropped 60-70% since the 1970s, but whose survival is vital for numerous bird populations. Gillespie’s mezzotints and silverpoint drawings are exhibited at <a href="http://www.kestlebarton.co.uk/arts-and-events/sarah-gillespie-moth/">Kestle Barton</a> in Cornwall, a venue that boasts more than 60 species of moths in its gardens, 12 September to 31 October.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/sep/04/moths-britains-under-threat-nocturnal-treasures-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The T Rex singer captivated generations with his strutting music and hyper-sexual charisma. As a tribute album is released, stars explain why he is glam’s greatest icon </p><p>In early 1971, a nine-year-old called David Evans was sitting at home in the suburbs of Dublin watching Top of the Pops. He was already a Beatles fan, but, by his own admission, he was completely unprepared for what was about to happen on screen.</p><p>“It was kind of challenging,” says Evans – better known as U2’s guitarist the Edge – of T Rex’s celebrated appearance performing Hot Love, frontman Marc Bolan sporting glitter under his eyes, the ground-zero moment for glam rock. “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/22/glitter-and-curls-marc-bolan-and-the-birth-of-glam-rock-style">Marc Bolan was magical, but also sexually heightened</a> and androgynous, with this glitter and makeup. It’s funny, the go-go dancers of the era were the legendary Pan’s People – he was way more intriguing sexually than they were. I’d never seen anything like it: ‘What the hell is this? Real lads are not into this kind of stuff – this is clearly music for girls.’ But when I picked up a guitar a year later, Hot Love was the first song I learned to play.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/04/marc-bolan-perfect-pop-star-t-rex-singer-tribute-album-elton-john-u2">Continue reading...</a>

That’s a matter for Prime Minister Ardern. But if there’s no Coivd in Christchurch, and there’s no Covid in Queensland, then there’s no reason both of them can’t come to Sydney. And that will mean, I think, an important boost for our tourist economy, whether it’s in New South Wales or anywhere else.

<p>The Guardian’s US Washington DC bureau chief, David Smith, discusses Donald Trump’s law and order gamble on the election, and how it is impacting on Democratic candidate Joe Biden’s campaign </p><p>The Guardian’s US Washington DC bureau chief, <strong>David Smith</strong>, talks to<strong> Anushka Asthana </strong>about Donald Trump’s election campaign, which is pushing a theme of law and order, while Democratic nominee Joe Biden has sought to bring Covid-19 to the fore. The US now has more than 6m coronavirus infections and 185,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 16 million are out of work. Yet last month’s Republican convention hailed Trump’s response to the virus and implied that the pandemic was a thing of the past.</p><p>Polls suggest the success of the Republican convention, and scenes of civil unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon, have enabled Trump to narrow the gap on Biden. Kenosha became the latest flashpoint in a long summer of unrest in America after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jacob-blake">Jacob Blake</a>, an African American, was shot seven times in the back by police as he tried to enter his vehicle. Three nights of protests set off more than 30 fires and culminated in a 17-year-old militia supporter allegedly shooting and killing two demonstrators – an act Trump has pointedly failed to condemn. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/04/will-trumps-law-and-order-gamble-pay-off">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With flights on hold, airline caterers have pivoted to selling direct-to-public, so how does an airline meal taste without cabin pressure?</p><p>“If you’re going to a cafe and paying $25 for a meal you have certain expectations. If you’re doing a 10-course fine dining degustation you have expectations … It’s one of those things where you have to set your expectations accordingly.”</p><p>This is the sage advice of aviation journalist Jordan Chong, who is counselling me on the purchase I’ve just made – three meal packs from Gate Gourmet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/04/plane-food-grounded-you-can-buy-airline-meals-on-land-now-they-cost-2-each-i-bought-27">Continue reading...</a>
