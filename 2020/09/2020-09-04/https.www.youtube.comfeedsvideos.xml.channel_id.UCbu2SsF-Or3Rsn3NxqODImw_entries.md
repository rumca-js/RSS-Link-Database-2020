Arasaka's number one competitor is the American security corporation known as Militech. Here's a brief look into the company's history.

One of the more exciting parts of Cyberpunk 2077 are the guns and dangerous megacorporations that make them. This video takes a look at the biggest weapon manufacturer in the world, Militech. This company makes top tier guns while also hiring out their private military for assassinations, revolutions, civil wars, and worse. 

In this video we go over the rise of Militech from its start to becoming nationalized by the New United States after the bloody Fourth Corporate War that leveled a huge part of Night City. We’re not sure yet if Militech makes power, tech, or smart weapons yet. It’s been revealed the best weapons in Cyberpunk 2077 will be taken from enemies or found in loot caches. There will be common to legendary variants. Weapons will be able to do things like curve around corners or pierce through walls.

We’re not entirely sure yet how or if Militech might play into the corpo lifepath but we have seen them appear in videos already including the 48 Minute gameplay reveal. In that encounter V is hacked and then tricked into frying a part of the Maelstrom gang. We also saw missions involving other corporate legends including Adam Smasher. You can learn all about his story in another one of our lore videos.

Cyberpunk 2077 releases on November 19th for Xbox Series X, PlayStation 4, Google Staida, Xbox One, and PC. No beta is currently scheduled.

Marvel's Avengers is out now, featuring six superheroes to choose from. Kamala Khan, The Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America all play totally differently from one another, so choosing which hero is right for you takes a bit of time.

The video above should help you make that decision, as Tony breaks down each hero's fighting style. Iron Man and Thor can rain down power from the sky, while The Hulk and Black Widow like to get up close and personal. All six heroes have a range of special abilities to level enemies and buff their stats too.

For more Avengers coverage, you can check out our early review impressions. If you're wondering how long the game's campaign takes to beat, we've got that answer too.
