To skate is to exist out of step with traffic and pedestrians, moving through urban spaces in a way that architects and town planners never intended and reinventing mundane blocks of concrete as a canvas for play and creativity. It is a subculture as much as a sport, but skateboarding is also a welcoming home for misfits.</p><p>So many adverts and music videos that clumsily riff on skating have failed to understand what the sport is about.

It understood what it was to be part of skateboarding, to the point it felt near-documentary.
