Sam Fisher is now in Ghost Recon, Elite Squad, Rainbow Six, and an upcoming VR game, but he still hasn't been in his own standalone Splinter Cell game since 2013. It's almost like Ubisoft knows that fans like the character but forget that they like him because they enjoy Splinter Cell. \n\nIn the video above, Jake Dekker expresses his exasperation at the lack of Splinter Cell games in recent years, especially in the face of Ubisoft continuing to support its other major tentpole franchises like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Far Cry, The Division, and Assassin's Creed. From a financial standpoint, sure, it makes sense. Splinter Cell doesn't sell as well. That doesn't change the fact that Ubisoft has left Splinter Cell fans thirsty for a drop of content for nearly a decade.\n\nJake posits a few theories as to why Ubisoft hasn't returned to Splinter Cell for quite some time--namely that, until quite recently, all of Ubisoft games were being developed with an almost singular gameplay philosophy that goes against the Splinter Cell style. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has also said that Ubisoft felt a bit of fan pressure while constructing 2013's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, which may be another possible influence on the developer's decision to steer clear of the franchise ever since.\n\nAs of right now, Ubisoft plans to conclude 2020 with three open world action games releasing back to back. In October, you'll be able to take part in a hacker revolution in Watch Dogs Legion. Then in November, Assassin's Creed Valhalla transports the franchise to the time of Vikings. Finally, December's Immortals Fenyx Rising is a Greek mythology-inspired game that plays awfully similar to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But no Splinter Cell. Not this year, anyway.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zzYSPt0hB8", "date_published": "2020-09-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Night City Wire Episode 3 - With Pre and Post Show", "description": "Tune into Cyberpunk 2077's third Night City Wire, which will showcase a tour of Night City, as well as take a look at gangs and more.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoPEaDt3j10", "date_published": "2020-09-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 Night City Wire Livestream - Episode 3", "description": "Tune into Cyberpunk 2077's third Night City Wire, which will showcase a tour of Night City, as well as take a look at gangs and more.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzWBak2YMFc", "date_published": "2020-09-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Cyberpunk 2077 \u2014 Official Cyber-Up Your PC Finale Trailer", "description": "Back in April, we asked you to Cyber-up Your PCs and create the most Cyberpunk 2077 case mod the world has ever seen.

On top of that, it showed off a number of new games to get viewers excited ahead of launch.\n\nThe reveals come following the Microsoft event, which also delivered a release date and prices for its two new Xbox consoles. If you watched the previous episode of Generation Next, you'll know that we think that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S are priced extremely modestly and are poised to capitalize on the low cost of entry. But how do Sony's consoles stack up?\n\nMore importantly, how did Sony do in winning the hearts and minds of those who are interested in making the jump to the next-generation? Well, the showcase was full of ups and downs and, in the aftermath, there has been a great deal of discussion about key information that wasn't delivered in an ideal way, if at all. Whether it's clarity on launch titles or the messy preorder situation, the question of if Sony has done enough isn't as easy to answer as you might think, but we're going to try and do it.\n\nJoin Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan as they talk through the PS5 showcase, analyze the approach Sony took, discuss key moments from the event, and drill down into what has happened since. \n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 - Intro\n01:24 - Console & Games Price\n06:05 - Release Date\n10:55 - Pre-Orders\n12:48 - Launch Titles\n20:08 - Future Titles\n24:48 - Final Thoughts\n29:53 - PS5 Let's Pre-Order (With Commentary)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rksHxBx3ku4", "date_published": "2020-09-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Some PS5 Games Will Offer Free PS4 Upgrades | Save State", "description": "With the news that some PS5 games will have PS4 versions, Sony has announced that upgrading games like Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Horizon: Forbidden West will be free. \n\nSpeaking of upgrades, Microsoft has explained how Xbox Series S backwards compatibility will work, ahead of preorders going live on September 22.\n\nNintendo held a Direct Mini this morning and announced two new Monster Hunter games, Monster Hunter Rise and Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:19 - PS5 Launch Games Include Free Upgrades\n01:08 - Microsoft Clarifies Xbox Series S Backward Compatibility\n01:54 - New Monster Hunter Games Coming To Switch", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4Dw58D4QHc", "date_published": "2020-09-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
