Katie Melua - Your Longing Is Gone - lyrics

It used to really feel like we were high flying 
you could say our days were too good to be true 
I loved it when you showed me that inside you were dying 
like I had to answer that pull from you 
and then the leaves changed shades and up they flew 
Your longing is gone 
now don’t go trying to force it 
your longing is gone 
I’m gonna leave with the morning dew 

I’ve got a list of places where I’ll find my freedom 
you could see me somewhere not thinking of you 
well maybe it’s because I gave you too much of what you were needing 
but the real reasons are fading and shading in the blue 
and then the sea grew dark and up it flew 
Your longing is gone 
it was sweet like a summer sky 
your longing is gone 
I just got used to it being all mine 

For a while we were the only thing that mattered in our lives 
how did you make me believe 
in such a sweet, in such a free, in such a cool thing 

Your longing is gone 
it doesn’t matter what I do 
your longing is gone 
I’m gonna leave with the morning dew 
your longing is gone 
I’m gonna leave with the morning dew
