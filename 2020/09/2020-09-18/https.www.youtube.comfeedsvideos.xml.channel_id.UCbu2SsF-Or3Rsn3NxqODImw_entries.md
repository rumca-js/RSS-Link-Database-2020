Spelunky 2 is a successful evolution of what made the original Spelunky work.

Andrew played 22 hours of Spelunky 2 for this review. The vast majority of that time was spent in Adventure mode, with a few rounds against bots in the multiplayer Arena and two cracks at the Daily Challenge. He left no pug behind and no turkey un-roasted. Code was provided by the publisher.

## What The Hell Happened To Splinter Cell

It kind of feels like Ubisoft is just making fun of us at this point, right? Sam Fisher is now in Ghost Recon, Elite Squad, Rainbow Six, and an upcoming VR game, but he still hasn't been in his own standalone Splinter Cell game since 2013. It's almost like Ubisoft knows that fans like the character but forget that they like him because they enjoy Splinter Cell. 

In the video above, Jake Dekker expresses his exasperation at the lack of Splinter Cell games in recent years, especially in the face of Ubisoft continuing to support its other major tentpole franchises like Ghost Recon, Rainbow Six, Far Cry, The Division, and Assassin's Creed. From a financial standpoint, sure, it makes sense. Splinter Cell doesn't sell as well. That doesn't change the fact that Ubisoft has left Splinter Cell fans thirsty for a drop of content for nearly a decade.

Jake posits a few theories as to why Ubisoft hasn't returned to Splinter Cell for quite some time--namely that, until quite recently, all of Ubisoft games were being developed with an almost singular gameplay philosophy that goes against the Splinter Cell style. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has also said that Ubisoft felt a bit of fan pressure while constructing 2013's Splinter Cell: Blacklist, which may be another possible influence on the developer's decision to steer clear of the franchise ever since.

As of right now, Ubisoft plans to conclude 2020 with three open world action games releasing back to back. In October, you'll be able to take part in a hacker revolution in Watch Dogs Legion. Then in November, Assassin's Creed Valhalla transports the franchise to the time of Vikings. Finally, December's Immortals Fenyx Rising is a Greek mythology-inspired game that plays awfully similar to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But no Splinter Cell. Not this year, anyway.

It's been a huge week for PlayStation, but with the scramble around preorders and Xbox Series S coming in cheaper--and with a better subscription service--was Sony's PS5 showcase enough? 

It'll come as no surprise to you that the subject of discussion on this week's Generation Next is the recent PlayStation Showcase, during which Sony finally confirmed the PlayStation 5 release date, as well as prices for both versions of its console. On top of that, it showed off a number of new games to get viewers excited ahead of launch.

The reveals come following the Microsoft event, which also delivered a release date and prices for its two new Xbox consoles. If you watched the previous episode of Generation Next, you'll know that we think that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S are priced extremely modestly and are poised to capitalize on the low cost of entry. But how do Sony's consoles stack up?

More importantly, how did Sony do in winning the hearts and minds of those who are interested in making the jump to the next-generation? Well, the showcase was full of ups and downs and, in the aftermath, there has been a great deal of discussion about key information that wasn't delivered in an ideal way, if at all. Whether it's clarity on launch titles or the messy preorder situation, the question of if Sony has done enough isn't as easy to answer as you might think, but we're going to try and do it.

Join Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan as they talk through the PS5 showcase, analyze the approach Sony took, discuss key moments from the event, and drill down into what has happened since.
