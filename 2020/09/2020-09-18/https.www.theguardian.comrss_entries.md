Welcome to the party Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Reed. </p><p>Further proof that Winged Foot has no interest whatsoever in reputation comes with the addendum that if two of the players jousting for US Open glory were afforded a final 36 holes in front of New York crowds, the past would feature prominently.

<p>The former alcoholic has turned his life around and the in-form jockey is chasing glory in Saturday’s big race with Spanish City</p><p>There are records that can map the progress of a racing career, and others that can stop one in its tracks. In 2012, Ray Dawson was banned from riding for two years, having acquired the unwanted distinction of becoming the first jockey in Ireland to test positive for a banned substance twice. Nor was that the end of Dawson’s problems in the early part of his career, or even the end of the beginning.</p><p>“When I got done the second time, that’s when things got really bad for me,” Dawson says. “I didn’t do anything about trying to get better, I was still in denial about having a problem. It wasn’t the ban. It was my actions after the ban that did for my career for a few years.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/sep/19/talking-horses-reformed-ray-dawson-horse-racing-tips-ayr-gold-cup-day">Continue reading...</a>

## Five Guys a Week review: low stakes, middling bachelors – and big fun

<p>A quintet of likable lads jostle for the affections of singleton Tara in the second series of the highly entertaining dating show that calls forth your inner judge. Resistance is futile</p><p>Five Guys a Week is back for a second series. For those of you who have not had the pleasure, the show follows a different woman every week as she bangs a quintet of eligible bachelors to find out which is the best at giving her a prolonged and inventive seeing to. No, not really – that’s just what the title wants you to think, you see!</p><p>Instead, what happens is that a lady (usually in her early to mid-30s, though occasionally vague memories of its public service remit will cross Channel 4’s mind and they’ll lob in someone who remembers decimalisation or the first Becky in Roseanne) looking for a long-term relationship invites five potential suitors into her home for a week. Every evening, she disinvites one of them for reasons ranging from the spurious to the entirely fair. Such are the vicissitudes of life and the human heart. Last season’s highlights included project coordinator Hope having to choose from five gingers, and salon owner Kellie narrowly avoiding being duped by simpleton-cum-Machiavel Barry (who, unless I misheard, thought steak marinaded in soy sauce “smelled like a carp’s tit”) and gat-toothed Amy, who was visibly aroused by the power of choice she commanded – a Wife of Bath for our times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/18/five-guys-a-week-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spurs fans need the homecoming nostalgia of someone they saw turn from a boy into a joy of a footballer</p><p>Gareth Bale’s final – well hopefully not final – goal for Tottenham was in the last minute of the last game of the season. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/19/tottenham-sunderland-premier-league-match-report" title="">Sunderland at White Hart Lane, 19 May 2013</a>. He picked the ball up on the right, cut inside like Arjen Robben and bent the ball into the top left corner from 25 yards past Simon Mignolet. It feels like Bale scored that goal a hundred times that season.</p><p>As soon as the ball hit the net, Emmanuel Adebayor ran to ask the crowd whether it was enough to get Spurs into the Champions League. It wasn’t. Beaten into fifth place by virtue of Arsenal’s win at Newcastle. André Villas-Boas insisted he could keep Bale at the club. He couldn’t.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/sep/18/why-i-cant-wait-to-see-gareth-bale-in-a-tottenham-shirt-again">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This was not supposed to happen, let alone happen so early in the autumn. It could have big consequences for politics as well as public health</p><p>We know that political classes in many countries, including Britain’s, can misjudge the mood of the times. So it would be wise not to read too much, too conclusively or too soon into the loud rumblings in the Conservative party about Boris Johnson and his government, and some of the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/the-times-view-on-the-prime-ministers-suitability-for-no-10-johnson-adrift-lxkxzcct3" title="">media reaction</a> to it. After all, it is only just over nine months since Mr Johnson won a crushing majority in the general election and the Tories remain ahead in almost all polls. This prime minister is not hanging on by his fingernails.</p><p>Nevertheless, rumblings – and sometimes more than that – there undoubtedly are. The Tory-supporting press that flashed warning signals to Mr Johnson every day this week is not making this new mood up. Three weeks ago, as MPs returned to Westminster after a summer of U-turns, Tory backbenchers launched some fierce criticism of the prime minister. Three weeks into the parliamentary session, the criticisms are increasing and they now come from a wider circle. Downing Street’s relations with Tory MPs were already poor because Dominic Cummings treats them with such disdain. No 10’s readiness to break international law in the Brexit process has made things worse. But the mishandling of Covid is at the heart of this, and that could clearly get a lot worse quite quickly. If that happens, it could have big political consequences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/the-guardian-view-on-a-second-wave-boris-johnson-should-be-worried">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the BBC: tough times ahead | Editorial

<p>A hostile government, culture wars and streaming services threaten the BBC – it must prove it is indispensable</p><p>The word “tough” appears three times in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/15/more-of-less-the-dilemma-facing-tim-davie-at-the-bbc" title="">Tim Davie</a>’s brief foreword to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2020/bbc-annual-report-2019-20" title="">BBC annual report</a> published this week. Whether the repetition was conscious or not, the message is clear – the corporation is in for difficult times. Cuts loom. The future of the licence fee is in question. It suits many on the right to frame the BBC as a pernicious force, a key part of the supposed stranglehold on British culture retained by a cosmopolitan, left-leaning elite.</p><p>In some ways this is business as usual for the BBC. Since its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/series/the-bbc-report" title="">foundation in 1922,</a> it has withstood attacks from governments. Perhaps this is inevitable. The paradox at its heart is that its charter and licence fee are set by <em>parti-pris</em> politicians, but its own purpose is to be impartial. The seven-year tenure of Lord Hall, the outgoing director general, may have seemed bumpy – think of the tangles over the Scottish and Brexit referendums; over climate change, equal pay, and on- and off-screen diversity. But seen against the backdrop of the BBC’s history, it has actually been pretty smooth – he survived, after all, unlike his predecessor George Entwistle, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/nov/10/bbc-crisis-george-entwistle-resigns" title="">lasted 54 days</a>; or Greg Dyke, who resigned in 2004 over coverage of “weapons of mass destruction”; or Alasdair Milne, forced out in 1987. It is easy to forget just how furiously BBC crises can blaze – and Boris Johnson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/25/boris-johnson-scolds-bbc-over-suggestion-proms-would-drop-rule-britannia" title="">recent intervention</a> in the Last Night of the Proms row shows how gleefully and malevolently he may wish to fan the flames. Working out precisely what impartiality means in a world not just of party politics but culture wars will only get harder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/the-guardian-view-on-the-bbc-tough-times-ahead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Clueless about the US, uninterested in Ireland, Boris Johnson and his team are crashing on to rocks they can’t even see </p><p>There is so much this government doesn’t know. But two particular areas of ignorance exploded into view this week, allowing us to take a long, hard look at the cost they are inflicting on the country. Both are central to the Brexit project that remains this government’s defining mission – but only one of them is surprising.</p><p>Start with the unexpected ignorance, which is of the US and US politics. It’s a surprise, because if there’s one thing that unites the British political class it’s an interest in – even an obsessive fixation on – the politics of the United States. (And yes, I plead guilty.)<strong> </strong>If you were to hold a nerds’ convention on The West Wing or House of Cards, you’d host it in SW1. The Westminster villager who struggles to identify a single German politician besides Angela Merkel will speak with ease about the latest polling from Maine’s second congressional district or the precise composition of the Wisconsin supreme court.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/brexiters-ignorance-disaster-clueless-us-ireland-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There were sheer organza face masks at Bora Aksu, one of the few live catwalk shows that went ahead – but the fashion world was trying to stay positive in very challenging times</p><p><br />London’s first catwalk show since lockdown opened with traditional nurse’s whites, complete with starched collars and nostalgic ruffle-edged aprons – although this was fashion week, so face masks were sheer organza and worn with pillar box red lipstick beneath.</p><p>The designer, Bora Aksu, had been thinking about the nurses of 1918, who faced dealing with the flu pandemic immediately after a war. Aksu followed the starched whites with a flurry of party dresses in the frosted pastels of 1920s flapper dresses, because, he says, “we need to remember that things will get better after this, as they did then”.<br /><br />In a sunny Covent Garden churchyard, Aksu’s 20-strong audience is socially distanced via the allocation of a wooden bench each. A few show-goers accessorise their face masks by layering coordinated veils in fishnet or lace over the top, in the style of Marlene Dietrich’s veiled hats. Aksu, who has shown at London fashion week for 14 years, is one of only three designers following through with a live fashion show to an audience this season. Those designers who had planned indoor shows, even on a tiny scale, have in the past few days mostly switched to individual appointments due to anxiety about rising infection rates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/18/this-moment-needs-joy-and-optimism-and-feathers-london-fashion-week-aims-to-stay-upbeat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ignored by critics, barely marketed and released in just 47 cinemas, the YA romance has eclipsed X-Men at the UK box office and even ran Tenet close. What’s its secret?</p><p>Its success <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/box-office-report-september-4-6-surprise-film-outperforming/">has been hailed</a> as “extraordinary” – not least because no one saw it coming. The YA romance After We Collided has next to no marketing budget and zero reviews – and has taken more than £1m after just two weeks in the UK. A few weeks ago, it wasn’t even in line for theatrical release.<strong> </strong>As the box office struggles in the pandemic, the industry has sat up to take note of this grassroots success. It is “completely unprecedented”, says Delphine Lievens, a senior box office analyst at <a href="https://gower.st/">Gower Street</a>. “To do that based on no marketing – it’s a really impressive result.”</p><p>After We Collided is the follow-up to last year’s After; both are adapted from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/17/one-direction-fan-fiction-books-movie-anna-todd">“new adult” novel series by the US author Anna Todd</a>. They follow the up-and-down relationship of college students Tessa (played by Josephine Langford) and Hardin (Hero Fiennes Tiffin – Joseph and Ralph’s nephew). Tessa is a headstrong and bookish young woman with parallels – the film insists – to Elizabeth Bennet. Hardin, meanwhile, is a bad-boy Brit whose eminent unsuitability is signposted by his many Ramones tees. Naturally, “Hessa” can’t keep away from each other, as much as their parents, love rivals and life circumstances conspire to keep them apart. Cue maudlin electro-pop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/18/after-we-collided-ya-romance-cinemas-future">Continue reading...</a>

## Matt Hancock, could you honestly think of no one better to run test and trace? | Marina Hyde

<p>With the system in chaos, Dido Harding says the increased demand could not have been predicted. Yes, really</p><p>Do you remember Ye Olde Operation Moonshotte, an ancient promise by the elders of this government to test 10 million people a day? My apologies for the leading question. There are absent-minded goldfish who remember that figure, given it was announced by Boris Johnson’s government barely three seconds ago. The only representative of the animal, vegetable and possibly mineral kingdoms who doesn’t remember it is the prime minister himself, who on Wednesday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/16/boris-johnson-is-tested-on-covid-and-brexit-his-specialist-subjects-of-ignorance">told a committee</a> asking him about it: “I don’t recognise the figure you have just given.” Like me, you probably feel grateful to be governed by a guy whose approach to unwanted questions is basically, “New phone, who dis?”</p><p>Like me, you will be reassured by Matt Hancock’s plan to throw another “protective ring” around care homes.

## Bilge, booze and misogyny: why I'm outraged by a new idea to police pregnant women

<p>Perhaps I should be more shocked by the latest proposal to control women. But what else can you expect in this supremely sexist era?</p><p>Last week I got an email from a reproductive rights campaigner I have known, liked and admired for many years. “Good morning,” it began. “I thought this would make you cross.” She went on to describe a fresh frontier in the war against pregnant women: that any woman drinking anything during pregnancy, even a glass of wine in the first week of it, would have that marked on her medical records, which would then be transferred to her baby’s records. It was <a href="https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/indevelopment/gid-qs10139/consultation/html-content-3">a Nice idea</a> (for clarification, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence – this is not a <em>nice</em> idea), being put out for consultation.</p><p>It did make me cross. Not because of <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-alcohol-pregnancy-mothers-drink-nice-b450858.html">the gross infringement of women’s privacy</a> – it would probably be illegal to transfer a woman’s health records over to those of her child – and complete obliteration of trust between a prospective mother and her midwife, but because this is just bilge. Welcome to the age of bilge, where mindless hysteria accrues around <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/25/pregnancy-hard-facts-emily-oster">risks for which there is no evidence</a>; where experts are disregarded in favour of fanatics; where real and demonstrable threats to pregnant women – which come mainly from underfunded services – are ignored in preference for finger-pointing; where no explanation is ever more complicated or less divisive than: “People (especially women) are weak.” But far more than cross, I felt nostalgic. Because I remember a time when this unusual approach was limited to pregnant women, and now it’s our whole politics.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/18/bilge-booze-misogyny-outrage-police-pregnant-women">Continue reading...</a>

He was also frequently bullying, controlling and violent </strong><strong>towards my</strong> <strong>mum, to the extent that he destroyed her confidence and hospitalised her. I believe in forgiveness, but he has never taken responsibility for </strong><strong>his behaviour, and always lied about it.</strong> <strong>My</strong> <strong>mum died several years ago, and he has gone on to be abusive and violent to other women</strong><strong>; he has always denied it or blamed other people for his vile behaviour. As far as I’m aware, my sister doesn’t know the truth</strong><strong>; she seems to believe </strong><strong>her father’s</strong> <strong>story, that he’s a victim of </strong><strong>a police conspiracy when he is repeatedly arrested.

<p>It trashed a £6,000 teapot collection; it set neighbour against neighbour; it made stars of Carol Smillie and Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen. Changing Rooms’ makers and contestants look back on their part in a TV treasure</p><p>Twenty years ago, when Caroline Hicks opened the door to reveal her new living room – renovated in just two days by her close friend Jo Thompson and designer Graham Wynne – three words became a mantra in her head. “I mustn’t swear, I mustn’t swear, I mustn’t swear,” the then 25-year-old thought to herself. Hicks’s plain cream Kent living room had been transformed into an “operating theatre”: the walls were white and her dining table was covered in aluminium paint. There were sandpaper squares on one wall and a permanently running water feature on the other. Hicks didn’t swear, but her lip visibly quivered. “Oh,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJSo8hqSS7g&amp;ab_channel=Laurie">she said</a>.</p><p>Hicks is just one of more than 600 people who appeared on the BBC’s home improvement show Changing Rooms between 1996 and 2004. The premise was simple: neighbours swapped homes and, with the help of designers, renovated a room each. With almost 12 million viewers at its peak, the programme was briefly a British institution – shortly after Hicks’s episode aired, a cashier in her local Habitat excitedly rang his boyfriend to exclaim that she was in his store. Recently, rumours began circulating that the show was to return after 16 years off-air. And why not? The daytime hit Ready Steady Cook was revived after a decade this March.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/18/mustnt-swear-life-as-victim-of-changing-rooms-makeover">Continue reading...</a>

It’s a practical necessity: if you’re one of her 250,000 Instagram followers or a regular visitor to her affordable-lifestyle blog, <a href="https://the-frugality.com/" rel="nofollow">The Frugality</a>, you’ll know that she and her husband are painstakingly renovating a period house in north London (they spent most of lockdown without a kitchen). Their home may be beautiful but it doesn’t offer much in the way of storage so, aside from a seasonal rotation of summer and winter pieces, her clothes have to fit into one small wardrobe and half a chest of drawers. “That’s except for my shoes,” she admits. “They’re trailing around everywhere.”</p><p>It hasn’t always been so. Space issues aside, Stedman’s approach to shopping and building her wardrobe has evolved. In part that’s because the former fashion editor no longer works in the newness-obsessed environment of a magazine office, but it’s also down to the demands of motherhood. “I used to be a trend addict and I’m definitely not now,” says the 37-year-old.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/give-up-to-give-back/2020/sep/18/i-used-to-be-a-trend-addict-how-i-learned-to-embrace-forever-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I was strip-searched at the border. To be betrayed by a family member touches you deeply</p><p>I was three years old when they built the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/berlinwall" title="">Berlin Wall</a>; my brother Ulrich was seven. My father was a communist, but by the time I was 16 my mother had convinced him that the family should apply for an exit visa from East Germany. The government refused and everything changed for the worse – we were treated as if we had betrayed the cause. I was kicked out of school. I couldn’t do the job I wanted to do. I wasn’t even allowed to do the sport I liked, which was track and field, because I was banned from my club.</p><p>Ulrich and I were never close. He started drinking at an early age. He had his first child at 21 and moved in with his girlfriend. I started ballroom dancing, because it was a competitive activity where clubs were private and not run by the authorities. I danced with my younger sister, Uta, and in 1981 we came third in the East German championships. We were told that we could represent the German Democratic Republic (GDR) internationally – if we first withdrew our exit visa request. We refused, so they stopped us from dancing. That was when I decided to escape. I was 22, but felt like I was living in a grave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/18/experience-my-brother-spied-on-me-for-the-stasi">Continue reading...</a>
