Adam is an Associate Professor of Marketing at New York University\u2019s Stern School of Business and author of Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and the Business of Keeping Us Hooked - which considers why so many people today are addicted to so many behaviours, from incessant smart phone and internet use to playing video games and online shopping. \nIn this episode we discuss nature of tech addiction, how social media and tech are designed to turn us in addicts and what the moral and ethical questions are surrounding that premise. Is it our fault that we are addicts? Should we just have more self-control? Or should the producers of these technologies be more responsible when designing these products?
