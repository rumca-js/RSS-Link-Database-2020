patch notes:
hermod is sequencing the piston honda wavetable, plaits, and pico voice. all have a fair amount of chance set up in the hermod, so the sequences are shifting. bass is 0-coast. chord organ from music thing modular is doing the chords, which are semi-random. vpme qd drum module is being sequenced and modulated by pamela's new workout. vocals through perform VE, hydrasynth doing poly backgroundf stuff. zoia on effects.
