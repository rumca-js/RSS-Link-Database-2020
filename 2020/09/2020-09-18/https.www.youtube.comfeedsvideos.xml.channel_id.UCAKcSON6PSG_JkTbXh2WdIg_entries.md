On September 17, 2007, Brooklyn's John Flansburgh and John Linnell — better known as They Might Be Giants — performed a session in our studio, hosted by Mark Wheat. Although we don't have footage from that event 13 years ago, we do have these three live performances TMBG gave last year on APM's "Live From Here" program with Chris Thile. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "The Mesopotamians"
2:59 "Let Me Tell You About My Operation"
6:13 "Istanbul (Not Constantinople)"
