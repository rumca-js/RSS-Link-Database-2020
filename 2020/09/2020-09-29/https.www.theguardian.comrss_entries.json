I don\u2019t think everyone who calls themselves an artist is owed time and space to express themselves, and enjoy career-long critical attention and a good living just because they have creative urges. But the overwhelming majority of arts projects are not associated with huge venues and big-name impresarios. Instead, they are fragile, freelance, contingent affairs. For every film, play or exhibition that doesn\u2019t happen, there is a huge cohort of producers, technical crew, creative artists and venue staff from sound mixers to bartenders and security who don\u2019t get employed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/artists-may-be-used-to-suffering-but-coronavirus-has-taken-it-to-extremes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/artists-may-be-used-to-suffering-but-coronavirus-has-taken-it-to-extremes", "date_published": "2020-09-29 14:00:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Is Boris Johnson really 'fit as a butcher's dog'?", "description": "<p>PM says he has made good progress in his attempt to slim down but NHS advice suggests he has some way to go</p><p>He faces angry Conservative backbenchers, a resurgent opposition and struggled on Tuesday to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/29/tories-competence-questioned-as-minister-fails-to-clarify-lockdown-rules\">clarify his own government\u2019s lockdown rules</a>, yet Boris Johnson\u2019s fortunes on another front would seem to be still hanging in the balance: the battle of the bulge.</p><p>On the basis of figures cited by the prime minister during a question and answer session after a speech in Exeter, he had a BMI (body mass index) of 34.9 earlier this year when he was treated in hospital for Covid-19.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/29/is-boris-johnson-really-fit-as-a-butchers-dog\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/29/is-boris-johnson-really-fit-as-a-butchers-dog", "date_published": "2020-09-29 13:52:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Williamson sets out plan to allow students in England home for Christmas", "description": "<p>As university Covid outbreaks continue, education secretary says some students may have to isolate before travelling</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Some students in England would need to self-isolate and their classes be shifted online in order to go home for Christmas, the education secretary has announced.</p><p>In a statement to the Commons on students\u2019 return to universities, which has so far resulted in Covid-19 outbreaks at 50 UK campuses, Gavin Williamson said his department would be issuing guidance on allowing students to return home over the Christmas break.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/29/williamson-allow-students-in-england-home-for-christmas-covid\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/29/williamson-allow-students-in-england-home-for-christmas-covid", "date_published": "2020-09-29 13:51:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Hannah John-Kamen: 'I love that Brave New World is too close to home'", "description": "<p>From Black Mirror to Ready Player One, the Yorkshire-born actor has spent her career delving into dystopia \u2013 making her ideally placed to star in a prescient adaptation of Huxley\u2019s novel</p><p>Much as 2016 threatened to put the brakes on political satire, so 2020 makes dystopian drama a difficult sell.

Nineteen ninety-five was the year I started out in video game journalism, as a writer for Edge magazine, the most forward-looking gaming publication in the world at the time. My introduction to the industry was booting up a brand new PlayStation and scorching through the UK launch titles. The machine had been available for several months in Japan, and Edge staff had played all the key games in their original NTSC format. They wanted me to catch up. At that time, Edge was on the top floor of Future Publishing\u2019s Beaufort House office, a converted pub, just off Queen\u2019s Square in Bath. While the older legacy publications \u2013 Total, Games Master, Sega Power \u2013 were crammed in on the ground floor, Edge shared upstairs with the brand new Official PlayStation Magazine. It felt like exactly the right place to be.</p><p>When thinking about PlayStation, especially today on the 25th anniversary of its UK launch, it\u2019s easy to trot out the technological advances the machine made. Following the 16bit consoles \u2013 the SNES and Mega Drive \u2013 PlayStation was among the first generation to prioritise 3D visuals, its powerful graphics co-processors able to throw 200,000 polygons a second around the screen in a dazzling display of graphics wizardry. When you played Ridge Racer or fighting game Toh Shin Den for the first time, when games such as Tomb Raider and Resident Evil arrived, you almost couldn\u2019t believe the lifelike cinematic clarity, the swirling cameras, the depiction of real, explorable environments.
