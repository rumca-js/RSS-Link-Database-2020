<p>Creativity does not offer any magic protection from the economic consequences of the pandemic – but we have to put health first<br /></p><p>I know artists are meant to suffer for their art and die alone in a garret, but this is ridiculous. Cinemas are open, but numbers are drastically down. Theatres and live venues teeter on the edge, balancing health risks and financial risks, trying to plan against possible lockdowns and impossible-to-predict futures. An email from a contact at a major gallery last week informed me that visitor numbers are 80% down from what they should be. The Royal Academy’s Summer Exhibition – bumped back so <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/28/royal-academy-summer-exhibition-review-tracey-emin-anselm-kiefer">it is now called the Winter Exhibition </a> – has just opened, but it won’t be the annual crowd-pleaser it is usually.</p><p>I am not romantic about art. The damage to the “creative industries” is not more important than damage to other areas of economic life. I don’t think everyone who calls themselves an artist is owed time and space to express themselves, and enjoy career-long critical attention and a good living just because they have creative urges. But the overwhelming majority of arts projects are not associated with huge venues and big-name impresarios. Instead, they are fragile, freelance, contingent affairs. For every film, play or exhibition that doesn’t happen, there is a huge cohort of producers, technical crew, creative artists and venue staff from sound mixers to bartenders and security who don’t get employed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/artists-may-be-used-to-suffering-but-coronavirus-has-taken-it-to-extremes">Continue reading...</a>

## Many fossil fuel workers like me want to transition to renewables – but we need support | Matt Craigan

<p>Covid has hit the industry hard, but the shift to renewables is inevitable. We need government-funded retraining<br /></p><p>Oil and gas is one of the main industries in Aberdeen where I grew up, and it was inevitable that I would follow in my father’s footsteps to work on the rigs out in the North Sea. Three weeks straight in the middle of the sea is tough, so much so that for many people their first stint is often their last. But the stability of the job when I started in the industry 13 years ago, as well as the decent pay and conditions, made up for the long periods away from family and friends.</p><p>This stability was to be short-lived. By 2016, a sustained period of oil price drops had hit the industry hard, and my employer of seven years took swift action, slashing jobs across the sector. That year there were 120,000 <a href="https://oilandgasuk.co.uk/oil-gas-uk-figures-show-impact-of-oil-price-downturn-on-jobs/">fewer jobs</a> than at the peak in 2014. The wages and bonuses that had enticed us on to the rigs as direct employees were made less and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/d3d0cf48-9036-11e4-8f09-00144feabdc0">less appealing</a>. Like many of my colleagues I became self-employed, as the new working conditions pushed us to leave what we thought would be jobs for life. It’s no wonder that a majority of workers in my industry <a href="https://platformlondon.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Oil-Gas-Workers-Report.pdf">rated</a> their job security as being so low<strong>.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/fossil-fuel-workers-transition-renewables-covid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dalian Pro striker on working with Rafa Benítez and being confined to a Chinese hotel for two months with barely a day off</p><p>Salomón Rondón remembers his hairs standing on end when, wearing Newcastle’s No 9 shirt for the first time, he ran on to the St James’ Park pitch. He only had half an hour as a substitute to try and turn things around against Spurs on the opening day of the 2018-19 season, but everything just seemed right. “I felt at this moment that this is my place and I have to be here for a long time,” he says. “I knew I was only on a year’s loan but I just thought: ‘I have to do my best to stay here.’”</p><p>Most would agree that he did, winning the player of the year award and being directly involved in almost half the side’s league goals. So the fact he is speaking via a video call from a hotel in Dalian, where he has essentially been detained for more than two months, suggests life has taken a few turns. One of them is Covid-19, of course, and it required that the first stage of the Chinese Super League campaign was contested between sides holed up in the same lodgings. Rondón’s employers, Dalian Professional, have been living alongside their seven rivals in Group A since mid-July, permitted to leave only for matches and training.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/29/salomon-rondon-if-i-have-a-chance-to-sign-again-for-newcastle-i-will-dalian-pro-rafa-benitez">Continue reading...</a>

## The Meaning of Mariah Carey review – fascinating memoir by a misunderstood star

<p>This is not the gossipy, celebrity reminiscence many might expect – but the chart-topping singer is captivating on race, wealth and her own ‘extraness’</p><p>In the popular imagination, Mariah Carey is a caricature: the embodiment of the demanding diva stereotype (a persona she has often played up to with relish). Her first memoir reveals her to be not just in on the joke, but peeling back the layers to deconstruct it. Because, for all the dry humour that flashes through The Meaning of Mariah Carey, it is not the glitzy, gossipy celebrity reminiscence some might expect, but instead a largely sombre dive into her past that, at times, feels like therapy. Indeed, Carey says as much: “Singing was a form of escapism for me, and writing was a form of processing.”</p><p>In this memoir, Carey processes her chaotic upbringing and troubled family relationships, her scrappy rags-to-riches entry into the music industry, and the gilded cage of her first marriage, to former Sony CEO Tommy Mottola in the 1990s, which she describes as emotionally abusive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/29/the-meaning-of-mariah-carey-review-fascinating-memoir-by-a-misunderstood-star">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>National Gallery, London<br /></strong>Artemisia Gentileschi took revenge on her rapist – and the chaotic battlefield of her life – through shockingly violent works. This magnificent show finally secures her reputation as one of the greats</p><p>This revolutionary exhibition of the work of a forgotten genius is like being on a film set, with the actors right in your face, and the lights revealing who they really are deep down inside. Bodies rush towards you out of the canvas, anguished faces, huge hands, explosions of blood. It’s a thrill ride from beginning to end, a Scorsese film shot in 17th-century Italy’s meanest streets, and it starts with a blow right to the heart.</p><p>In 1610, the year she turned 17, Artemisia, daughter of the moderately successful artist Orazio Gentileschi, painted a blinding masterpiece in her bedroom. Susanna and the Elders lights a fire in your soul. Susanna sits naked on a grey stone seat, her left foot dipping into the clear waters of a pool she’s just bathed in. But as she rests there, two looming male figures force themselves into the confined space of the canvas. These creeps don’t just spy on Susanna, they push right up close to her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/29/artemisia-gentileschi-review-national-gallery-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the UK version launched, it was like a door opening on a new dimension of astonishing cinematic clarity and thrilling new worlds to explore</p><p>There was a sense of fundamental cultural change in the air – or that’s how I remember it. Nineteen ninety-five was the year I started out in video game journalism, as a writer for Edge magazine, the most forward-looking gaming publication in the world at the time. My introduction to the industry was booting up a brand new PlayStation and scorching through the UK launch titles. The machine had been available for several months in Japan, and Edge staff had played all the key games in their original NTSC format. They wanted me to catch up. At that time, Edge was on the top floor of Future Publishing’s Beaufort House office, a converted pub, just off Queen’s Square in Bath. While the older legacy publications – Total, Games Master, Sega Power – were crammed in on the ground floor, Edge shared upstairs with the brand new Official PlayStation Magazine. It felt like exactly the right place to be.</p><p>When thinking about PlayStation, especially today on the 25th anniversary of its UK launch, it’s easy to trot out the technological advances the machine made. Following the 16bit consoles – the SNES and Mega Drive – PlayStation was among the first generation to prioritise 3D visuals, its powerful graphics co-processors able to throw 200,000 polygons a second around the screen in a dazzling display of graphics wizardry. When you played Ridge Racer or fighting game Toh Shin Den for the first time, when games such as Tomb Raider and Resident Evil arrived, you almost couldn’t believe the lifelike cinematic clarity, the swirling cameras, the depiction of real, explorable environments. It was like a dimensional doorway opening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/29/uk-playstation-at-25-put-video-games-centre-of-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rugby Players’ Association has warned the pandemic threatens to crumble rugby union’s professional structure in months</p><p>The Oxford dictionary definition of a crisis is a time of danger. Alternatively just listen to the words of Damian Hopley, chief executive of the Rugby Players’ Association, as he seeks to protect his members’ livelihoods. “Can clubs survive until Christmas or into next year? Can some unions survive? It’s a very stark situation. The foundations of sport have been completely rocked and we’re now in a position where we’re starting to understand the real impact.”</p><p>Hopley is not exaggerating for effect. The players he represents are trapped in a nightmare that rugby union can ill afford. The Covid-19 situation is affecting everyone in the country to some degree but give it another three months and, without the return of crowds or matchday income, we will be discussing much of professional rugby in the past tense. Not just the odd struggling Premiership club but almost all of it, save for a lucky few with a billionaire writing endless blank cheques.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/29/rugby-union-players-fear-for-future-as-covid-typhoon-sweeps-through-sport">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She was called an ‘extremist’ by opponents and treated as a liability by Labour. This exclusive extract from a biography explains how she defied them all to make history in 1987<br /></p><p>The 1987 election campaign was the first time the Labour party had fielded so many black and Asian candidates. Yet Diane Abbott got the impression that “the national party thought we were an embarrassment”. Certainly, “they offered no support of any kind” and Labour’s party political broadcasts featured practically no black people.</p><p>The Tories, on the other hand, saw Abbott as an electoral asset – but not for Labour.

## I’ve lost weight – and with it any sensation through penetrative sex

<p>I am too embarrassed to talk to my partner, but think we have both noticed that something has changed. What can I do?<br /></p><p><strong>I am 38</strong><strong> and in a long-term and happy relationship. While I have</strong><strong> never orgasmed through penetration (only through foreplay), </strong><strong> I have still enjoyed it</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Recently, though, I have barely felt any sensation through penetration</strong><strong>, something I believe my partner </strong><strong>has felt, too. I say “believe” because I don’t want to </strong><strong>ask him directly if I feel too “loose” or if he</strong><strong> is not feeling any sensation </strong><strong> (</strong><strong>it</strong><strong> is embarrassing enough just writing it). </strong><strong>But I can tell by his reaction</strong><strong> that </strong><strong>sex is not the same as it was. I</strong><strong>s this a common situation as women get older? Is there anything I can do differently? I have lost about 9kg (20lbs) lately, but I thought sex was meant to get better with weight loss. I</strong><strong> have tried different positions and have been doing </strong><strong>pelvic floor exercises for the </strong><strong>past couple of weeks. I</strong><strong> would hate to think that</strong><strong> is it for me ever enjoying penetrative sex again.</strong></p><p>This is something you need to discuss with your partner, so try to recognise that you cannot allow embarrassment to prevent you from seeking answers or finding a solution. Be brave enough to have a talk with him and to frame it as a subject you must both address for the sake of your sex life – and your relationship generally. Ask him to help you understand what changes he may have noticed and how it may have affected his sexual response, his pleasure and even his ability to become aroused and to ejaculate. How does he truly feel about your weight loss? Help him to feel safe enough to tell you. He may need time to get used to it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/29/ive-lost-weight-and-with-it-any-sensation-through-penetrative-sex">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The deliverer of electropop’s most withering putdowns talks club culture, workaholism and making French rock cool again </p><p>Empathy and gentle encouragement are all well and good, but sometimes you need browbeating into action. How else to explain the appeal of fitness instructors, BDSM and Marie Davidson? Since her first dancefloor-adjacent release in 2014, the French-Canadian producer has made intimidation her brand, disparaging the shallow side of club culture and its self-destructive behaviours in a voice that could shrivel ripe plums. It wasn’t just a pose, either. Each record, from Perte d’Identité (identity loss) to Adieu au Dancefloor (goodbye to the dancefloor) to her breakout, 2018’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/05/marie-davidson-working-class-woman-review-ninja-tune">Working Class Woman</a>, sought enlightenment amid the sadistic aesthetic.</p><p>The latter was conceived as an “anti-burnout” record, even if lead single Work It, with its exhortations of “sweat dripping down your balls”, was often misinterpreted as a productivity doctrine: the real work, Davidson avowed at the song’s conclusion, was nurturing oneself. Planning to tour it for a year, then take a year’s sabbatical, she thought she had built-in limitations that would allow her to do just that. Yet she succumbed to burnout anyway, ending up plagued by chronic insomnia, a sleeping-pill addiction and strange rashes. “It’s like a domino effect,” she says. “You get caught in a spiral until you realise: this is not working any more.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/29/marie-davidson-we-were-the-under-under-under-of-the-underground-renegade-breakdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Launched into obscurity in 2018 but now hugely popular, this online version of wink murder, with its focus on fabrication and blame-shifting, is scarily on point</p><p>There are 10 crew members trapped on a spacecraft, carrying out menial tasks to maintain vital systems, but at least one of them is an imposter who wants to sabotage their work and if possible, murder them. What sounds like the premise of a particularly bleak science-fiction movie is in fact the set-up of one of the most popular video games of the year. Developed by a three-person team at InnerSloth and launched to virtual obscurity in 2018, Among Us has suddenly become one of the biggest games on PC and mobile, attracting more than 85m players in the last six months. It’s so successful, InnerSloth recently abandoned plans to work on a sequel, instead piling their resources into the original. No one, it seems, is more surprised about the success of this game than its creators.</p><p>So why has this happened? Among Us is essentially an online multiplayer version of the party game wink murder, but set on a constantly malfunctioning spaceship. Up to 10 players take part, and at the beginning, you’re told whether you’re an innocent crew member or an imposter. While the former carry out jobs such as rebooting the communications systems or cleaning out the air ducts, the latter stalk the corridors breaking vital equipment or looking for victims to kill.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/29/among-us-the-ultimate-party-game-of-the-covid-era">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arrington helped turn Ohio into America’s funkiest state, but turned away from music for 25 years to work as a minister – and find himself. Now he’s back with a new album</p><p>Yellow Springs, Ohio, is buzzing, despite it being a weekday afternoon in a pandemic. When Steve Arrington and I meet at a cafe on the town’s main strip, we instinctively reach out our hands to shake. And then, midway, we remember. As we switch to the now-common elbow bump, he sighs. “We do what we can to get by, I guess.”</p><p>Arrington, 64, is no stranger to adaptation. His career as one of the greatest funk stars in the US began on the underground scene in nearby Dayton just as it began to take off in the mid-1970s. Arrington’s older brother was in bands, and some of the best funk drummers of the era would come to the family home and play while a young Steve sat on the steps. They would give him permission to play on their kits when they weren’t using them, and this is how Arrington drummed his way into bands throughout the area, most notably joining Slave in 1978 as a drummer before sliding in as a backup vocalist and eventually taking over as lead singer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/29/i-need-to-spread-love-with-the-gifts-god-gave-me-funk-master-steve-arrington-returns">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I am deeply involved in my niece and nephew’s lives. It is an effortless love I was falsely told I was incapable of feeling</p><p>“Zia, can I have some Mentos?” my seven-year-old nephew, Samson, asks me this every Wednesday when I pick him up from school. When I’m fuelling up my car before I get him, I stock up on rainbow Mentos from the servo to ensure he will not be disappointed. It is a ritual I adore.</p><p>I have never desired to have children. Whatever that feeling is, I don’t know it. Since I was a teenager, this proclamation was met with a monologue of why I am a defective woman. I was told I could never understand what it means to love a child. That I must hate children, that there was only one real way to have them in your life; to have your own. I internalised this narrative and rejected the idea of children being important to me, believing I was missing the child-loving gene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/29/i-dont-want-children-but-being-an-aunt-is-the-joy-of-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

Or, at the very least, you must say that you are. After the US’s disastrous response to the pandemic, Donald Trump still insists he is “<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/donald-trump-science-coronavirus-claim_n_5f3654dbc5b65bbd8c8b7142?ri18n=true">guided by science</a>”. In the UK, Boris Johnson and his ministers always claimed that our own bumbling response was either “led by the science” or “<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/politics-explained/boris-johnson-coronavirus-lockdown-chris-whitty-patrick-vallance-follow-science-b553465.html">following the science</a>”, even as Britain’s infection rate soared above other countries that were also, in their own words, following the science.</p><p>Sometimes it is easy for us to separate out<strong> </strong>false claims about science from real ones. Early in the crisis, the majority of mainstream scientists, and institutions such as the World Health Organization, supported swift lockdown measures. Trump resisted this approach, instead putting his faith in quack cures that his closest scientific advisers <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/29/dr-fauci-says-all-the-valid-scientific-data-shows-hydroxychloroquine-isnt-effective-in-treating-coronavirus.html">clearly opposed</a>. Johnson has tended to drag his heels, taking the right scientific advice too late, as with lockdown, or making a mess of the execution, as with testing and tracing.

<p>Coronavirus has hit few sectors harder than air travel, wiping out tens of thousands of jobs and uncountable billions in revenue. While most fleets were grounded, the industry was forced to reimagine its future</p><p>When an airline no longer wants a plane, it is sent away to a boneyard, a storage facility where it sits outdoors on a paved lot, wingtip to wingtip with other unwanted planes. From the air, the planes look like the bleached remains of some long-forgotten skeleton. Europe’s biggest boneyard is built on the site of a late-30s airfield in Teruel, in eastern Spain, where the dry climate is kind to metallic airframes. Many planes are here for short-term storage, biding their time while they change owners or undergo maintenance. If their future is less clear, they enter long-term storage. Sometimes a plane’s limbo ends when it is taken apart, its body rendered efficiently down into spare parts and recycled metal.</p><p>In February, Patrick Lecer, the CEO of Tarmac Aerosave, the company that owns the Teruel boneyard and three others in France, had one eye cocked towards China. Lecer has been in aviation long enough to remember flights being grounded during the Sars epidemic in 2003. This year, when the coronavirus spread beyond Asia, he knew what was coming. “We started making space in our sites, playing Tetris with the aircraft to free up two or three or four more spaces in each,” he told me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/29/inside-the-airline-industry-meltdown-coronavirus-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

Law was a founding member of Demosisto, a pro-democracy party that disbanded the same day Beijing imposed its new security law on the semi-autonomous region.
