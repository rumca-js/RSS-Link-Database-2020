Correction, Number of infections in India is proabably 9, 620,000, not 60, million as written. However the IFR calculation is still valid as this is based on the number of reported deaths, compared to the overall population. This means the US is likly to have a higher overall number of infections, compared to India.

Recent Increase in COVID-19 Cases Reported Among Adults Aged 18–22 Years — United States, May 31–September 5, 2020

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e4.htm?s—cid=mm6939e4—w


Young adults with COVID-19 can spread infection to their contacts and communities.

August 2–September 5

Weekly cases, 18–22 years

Increased 55% nationally

Northeast (144%)

Midwest (123%)

Increases in cases not attributable to increased testing.

Therefore

Young adults, also in colleges and universities

Should take precautions

Mask wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene, and follow local, state, and federal guidance

Institutions of higher education should take action to promote healthy environments


Multiple COVID-19 Clusters on a University Campus — North Carolina, August 2020

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e3.htm?s_cid=mm6939e3_w

A North Carolina university

Rapid increase in cases and clusters within 2 weeks of opening

August 3–25

670 laboratory-confirmed cases

96% were among patients aged less than 22 years

Eighteen clusters of five or more epidemiologically linked cases

All within 14 days of one another

Student gatherings and congregate living settings

Both on and off campus contributed

Therefore 

Enhanced measures are needed to reduce transmission at institutes of higher education

Reducing on-campus housing density

Ensuring adherence to masking and other mitigation strategies

Increasing testing

Discouraging student gatherings.

I think that infections are going to rise now and we will approach a plateau, and then a gradual decline will begin, there is unlikely to be a peak

The plateau will probably be at the start of October

Efficacy of masks and face coverings in controlling outward aerosol particle emission from expiratory activities

(Nature, Scientific Reports 24th September)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7

Examined micron scale particle emission by mask-wearers into the surrounding air

Surgical and KN95 masks reduce outward particle emissions

Coughing, 74% reduction

Speaking, 90% reduction

Decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter

Who emitted up to two orders of magnitude more expiratory particles via coughing than average

? virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized fomites
