Every business has the right to operate

Some of the locals can do reasonable regulations. But you can't just say no

a full Super Bowl (NFL) in Tampa in February

Local governments may implement limited restrictions ……

If they are able to prove the decision can be justified based on both public health and economic factors

Why we have restrictions

Population, 21. 48 million 

Probably 2.2 million immune

19 million not immune 

13.3 million (70%) potential infections

Potential hospitalizations, 665, 000 (5%)

Potential 40, 000 deaths (0.3%)

England R = 1.4

Scotland R = 1.3

Wales R = 1.4

In 7 days

North West, tripled from 12,544 to 36,316

North East and Yorkshire, more than doubled from 12,916 to 27,731

London, doubled, from 9,291 to 18,200

The number of cases in the UK continues to rise at an alarming rate as we are seeing figures doubling weekly across the country (TS)

The government has confirmed that our data from our loyal app users  is playing a critical role and currently providing the most up-to-date figures

France
Government, no plan to order a new nationwide lockdown

Russia

Victor Maleev from the Russian Academy of Sciences

Well over 8,000 daily cases

I think that infections are going to rise now and we will approach a plateau, and then a gradual decline will begin, there is unlikely to be a peak

The plateau will probably be at the start of October

Brazil

Death rates high in April and May

? herd immunity

Increasing cases this month


Efficacy of masks and face coverings in controlling outward aerosol particle emission from expiratory activities

https://depts.washington.edu/pandemicalliance/covid-19-literature-report/latest-reports/

(Nature, Scientific Reports 24th September)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-72798-7

Examined micron scale particle emission by mask-wearers into the surrounding air

Surgical and KN95 masks reduce outward particle emissions

Coughing, 74% reduction

Speaking, 90% reduction

Decreased the outward particle emission of a coughing superemitter

Who emitted up to two orders of magnitude more expiratory particles via coughing than average

? virus-contaminated fabrics can generate aerosolized fomites

Importance of regular washing of homemade masks

Symptoms
https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/early-covid-signs

Headache and Fatigue 

Dark Horses of COVID Symptoms

Most commonly experienced early symptoms are:

Headache, 82%

Fatigue 72%

This is the case for all age groups

9% of COVID-positive adults aged 18 - 65 didn’t experience headache or fatigue

1% of people who reported fatigue and/or headache tested positive for COVID

3% of people who tested positive had headache and fatigue alone

Therefore

Having either or both of those symptoms alone is unlikely to be indicative of COVID.

The Classic Three are Still Key

Cough, fever, loss of smell

40% of all age groups, fever in the first seven days
