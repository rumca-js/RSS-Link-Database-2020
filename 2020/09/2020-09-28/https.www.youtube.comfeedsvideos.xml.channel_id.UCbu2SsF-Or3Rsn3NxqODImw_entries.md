Fast load times and quick resume steal the show in our first hands-on experience with the Xbox Series X. We also explore performance in backwards compatible Xbox One games.

Here's how the Series X loading times stack up to an Xbox One X. Tested on Red Dead Redemption 2, Control, Outer Worlds, and FFXV.

Xbox Series X features faster loading times than its predecessor the Xbox One X, and the difference between the two systems is extremely impressive. We were able to go hands-on with the two systems and compare their loading times across Red Dead Redemption 2, Control, The Outer Worlds, and Final Fantasy XV. See for yourself how much less time you’ll spend waiting on loading screens and how much more you can spend playing games. Once we have access to games that are releasing with Xbox Series X versions, we’ll have to see how they compare, as well.
