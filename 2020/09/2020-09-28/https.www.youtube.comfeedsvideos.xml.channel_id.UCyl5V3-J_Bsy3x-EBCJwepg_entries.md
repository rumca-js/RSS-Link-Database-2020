Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan speak with Seamus Coughlin, who is the man behind FreedomToons and also an animator, writer, director, editor, and uncanny Ben Shapiro impersonator. They talk about arson being bad, punching the Pope, and being as libertarian as the Catholic church allows. 

Today, Seamus produces entertaining animated content for a number of outlets, and a good deal of his work can be found on the FreedomToons YouTube channel and the Foundation for Economic Education series Common Sense Soapbox with Seamus Coughlin.
