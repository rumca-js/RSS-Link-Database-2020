LYRICS

Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
I expected you to
Be better
 
It’s not like you climbed Mount Everest
And even if you did
I would be more impressed
If you talked less
If you talked less
If you talked less
 
It’s not like you’re running from the government
Or did you just escape
Solitary confinement
Could you talk less
Could you talk less
Could you talk less
   
Have you noticed no one else is speaking?
 
Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
 
You don’t need to think about what to say next
I know you’re anxious but you
Might actually make some friends
If you talk less
If you talk less
If you talk less
 
So put down your phone and look me in the eyes
Cause chicks dig when you’re
Inquisitive about their lives
If you talk less
You get more ass
You get more ass
 
Have you noticed no one else is speaking?
 
Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
I expected you to
Be better

Now here’s how you do it 
Step 1:
Stop thinking about yourself
Step 2:
Focus on someone else
Step 3:
Ask them a question like you care
Step 4:
Try to care
 
Step 1:
Stop thinking about yourself
Step 2:
Focus on someone else
Step 3:
Ask them a question, like you care
Step 4:
Try to care
 
Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
Be better
Be better at listening
You’re not that interesting
I expected you to
Be better
