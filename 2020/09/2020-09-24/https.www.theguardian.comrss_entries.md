<p>The Conservatives have form when it comes to jettisoning failing leaders. Ideology is the issue, not who’s in No 10</p><p>Boris Johnson was crowned Conservative leader by MPs who knew he was lazy, unprincipled, and incompetent, a charlatan driven by one cause: himself. But there was a greater consideration than his suitability for high office, and that was his effectiveness as an antidote to the twin menaces of Faragism and Corbynism. If they did not recoup their electoral losses to the Brexit party, and disillusioned remainers flocked back to the Labour fold, Toryism faced an existential crisis that might parachute Jeremy Corbyn into No 10.</p><p>Johnson was the panic button, to be pressed only in the direst of political emergencies. Uniquely, of any viable Tory candidate, Johnson met the challenge of the age of populism, and his Teflon qualities allowed him to revise Brexit red lines – throwing his unionist allies into the Irish Sea – to secure a deal that his supporters could make-believe would cause Brussels to cave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/24/labours-target-tory-party-johnson-credibility-conservatives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Why did the Red Wall collapse? Voices from the heartlands on Labour and the north-south divide<br /></p><p>In mid-2019, a former employee of the Conservative party called James Kanagasooriam began looking at recent electoral statistics for parts of England long associated with support for the Labour party. As a teenager, he had been fixated with a duvet cover featuring a map of the UK, and the fact that, in political terms, “the bottom half was blue while the top half was red”. Now, he realised, that was becoming much less certain.</p><p>Support for the Tories in the north of England, north Wales and the Midlands had grown by around 15% over the previous decade, and Kanagasooriam saw the possibility of a truly historic shift. Everything, he surmised, came down to the “degradation of historical memory: Mrs Thatcher, heavy industry, coal mining. The economics that had driven those places to group together was being replaced by a cultural sense of belonging that was more proximate to the Conservatives”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/24/beyond-the-red-wall-by-deborah-mattinson-and-the-northern-question-by-tom-hazeldine-review">Continue reading...</a>

When I first worked in TV, I learned a female colleague was – in a senior male’s opinion – “eating herself off the air”.

And by “sins” I mean perfectly natural blemishes, wrinkles or signs of ageing. In theory, this could have presented an opportunity to change attitudes.

I’d always admired his work and what I had read about him intrigued me. That’s why in 1975, when I heard the Royal Academy was planning a show of his paintings, on a whim I asked a young woman involved in the exhibition whether it might be possible to photograph him. She told me it shouldn’t be a problem, and a week later she and I were off to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/salford">Salford</a> on the train.</p><p>I don’t remember much about Lowry’s home.

For a start, she is not an austere man in a dark suit, but a 36-year-old woman in pilates gear, who laughs often and generously. She doesn’t need the sonorous tones of a Southern Baptist preacher to make her point – she has social media – and with Nigerian-born parents her ancestors were not among those enslaved and transported across the Atlantic several centuries ago. Yet, as one of the three founders of Black Lives Matter, Opal Tometi has helped to reignite the civil rights movement.</p><p>BLM was formed in 2013 when Oakland-based organiser Alicia Garza felt moved to respond to the acquittal of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/george-zimmerman-trayvon-martin-lawsuit">George Zimmerman</a>.

<p>How one magic word became a way of justifying Silicon Valley’s unconstrained power </p><p>There are certain phrases that are central to the sway the tech industry holds over our collective imagination: they do not simply reflect our experience, they frame how we experience it in the first place. They sweep aside certain parts of the status quo, and leave other parts mysteriously untouched. They implicitly cast you as a stick-in-the-mud if you ask how much revolution someone is capable of when that person represents billions in venture capital investment. Among the most influential of these phrases is undoubtedly “disruption”.</p><p>The concept of disruption is a way for companies, the press or simply individuals to think about questions of continuity and discontinuity – what lasts and what doesn’t, what is genuinely new and what is just the next version of something older. There is a lot at stake in how we think about these issues. Are the changes the tech industry brings about, or claims to bring about, fundamental transformations of how capitalism functions, or are they an extension of how it has always functioned? The answers to such questions will determine what regulatory oversight we believe is necessary or desirable, what role we think the government or unions should play in a new industry such as tech, and even how the industry and its titans ought to be discussed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/24/disruption-big-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-power">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It is responsible for 8% of emissions, yet food waste is not mentioned in any country’s Paris climate action plan<br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/24/tesco-dave-lewis-calls-on-companies-and-countries-to-tackle-food-waste">Tesco boss calls on firms and countries to tackle food waste</a></li></ul><p>As a society, we are converting more and more land to food production, with massive consequences for wildlife, water and forests. Yet one third of all food produced is thrown away and food waste is responsible for a staggering 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, more than any country in the world bar the US and China. This is an environmental disaster but it is a social and economic one, too, when more than 800 million people are undernourished and food waste costs the global economy $940bn (£737bn) each year.</p><p>The effects of climate change are already being felt, in droughts, fires and extreme temperatures. But while climate is high on the agenda, the role food waste plays is not. Not enough companies are making financial disclosures related to climate or food waste. And not a single country mentions food waste in its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris climate agreement, each country’s plan to keep climate change in check. That must change. If we continue to waste good food at current levels, we will fatally undermine our ability to tackle the climate emergency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/24/its-time-to-get-serious-about-food-waste-in-fight-against-global-heating-paris-climate">Continue reading...</a>

Very little was known about the best way to treat those infected, and testing was almost non-existent in the community. But six months on, with infections rising once more, is the country in a better state of preparedness to face a new wave of coronavirus cases?</p><p>Joining <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>today are four of the Guardian’s expert reporters. <strong>Denis Campbell, </strong>health policy editor,<strong> </strong>looks at the NHS and the measures it has taken to prepare for a winter crisis like no other it has faced. <strong>Robert Booth</strong>, social affairs correspondent, reports on the state of care homes, where a disaster played out over the summer resulting in thousands of premature deaths. The health editor, <strong>Sarah Boseley, </strong>takes a closer look at the UK’s coronavirus testing regime with widespread reports of demand vastly outstripping supply. Finally, the science editor, <strong>Ian Sample, </strong>explores the best hope for a lasting solution to the crisis: a vaccine, but warns that a mass vaccination programme is still some way off. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/24/is-the-uk-ready-for-a-covid-second-wave-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
