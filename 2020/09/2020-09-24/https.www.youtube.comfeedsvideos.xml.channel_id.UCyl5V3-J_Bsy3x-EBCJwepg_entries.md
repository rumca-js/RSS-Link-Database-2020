Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk about the week’s biggest stories like the NBA’s heartwarming tribute to Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Donald Trump ordering all the nation’s schools to show the movie ‘Top Gun’ daily instead of 1619 Project materials, and how 95% of evangelicals don’t believe in God, the Bible, or Jesus. Kyle and Ethan also talk to demon and ghost investigator Billy Hallowell about demon possessions, infestations, and what happens when you use that Ouija board.
