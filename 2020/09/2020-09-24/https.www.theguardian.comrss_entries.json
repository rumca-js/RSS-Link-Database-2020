There is a lot at stake in how we think about these issues. Are the changes the tech industry brings about, or claims to bring about, fundamental transformations of how capitalism functions, or are they an extension of how it has always functioned? The answers to such questions will determine what regulatory oversight we believe is necessary or desirable, what role we think the government or unions should play in a new industry such as tech, and even how the industry and its titans ought to be discussed.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/24/disruption-big-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-power\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/24/disruption-big-tech-buzzword-silicon-valley-power", "date_published": "2020-09-24 05:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Carbon storage technologies critical for meeting climate targets \u2013 IEA", "description": "<p>International Energy Agency says without CCUS projects energy goals will be impossible to reach</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/24/what-is-carbon-capture-usage-and-storage-and-can-it-trap-emissions\">What is carbon capture, usage and storage?</a></li></ul><p>Global governments and major polluters must take urgent action to develop technologies which can capture and store carbon emissions or it will be \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d for the world to meet its climate targets, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>The global energy watchdog said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/carbon-capture-and-storage\">carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS)</a> projects should play a central role in meeting climate targets as one of four key pillars in reducing emissions.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/24/carbon-storage-technologies-critical-for-meeting-climate-targets-iea\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/24/carbon-storage-technologies-critical-for-meeting-climate-targets-iea", "date_published": "2020-09-24 05:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "From diplomat to dinghy: why people are risking the Channel in small boats", "description": "<p>A blinded politician, a woman who was gang-raped, and a young man whose kidney was stolen tell how they had no choice</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/24/migrants-who-crossed-channel-could-be-sent-to-detention-centre\">Migrants who crossed Channel could be sent to detention centre</a></li></ul><p>Dr Yahya al-Rewi 60, from Yemen, has gone from diplomat to dinghy: he was president of his government\u2019s national information centre, part of the interior ministry.</p><p>\u201cBefore all the problems started I travelled from country to country by plane using my diplomatic passport.

Yet one third of all food produced is thrown away and food waste is responsible for a staggering 8% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, more than any country in the world bar the US and China. This is an environmental disaster but it is a social and economic one, too, when more than 800 million people are undernourished and food waste costs the global economy $940bn (\u00a3737bn) each year.</p><p>The effects of climate change are already being felt, in droughts, fires and extreme temperatures. But while climate is high on the agenda, the role food waste plays is not. Not enough companies are making financial disclosures related to climate or food waste. And not a single country mentions food waste in its nationally determined contribution (NDC) to the Paris climate agreement, each country\u2019s plan to keep climate change in check. That must change. If we continue to waste good food at current levels, we will fatally undermine our ability to tackle the climate emergency.</p> <a
