Original (Gameplay Comparison)", "description": "The PS5 Demon's Souls Remake shows a lengthy gameplay walkthrough of the Nexus tutorial, so we decided to see how the game looks compared to its 2009 original.\n\nDemon's Souls was first released for the PlayStation 3 in 2009, and while it has become something of a cult classic, the Dark Souls franchise that followed it has had a massive impact on the gaming landscape ever since. So it's no surprise that the upcoming remake of Demon's Souls, bound for the PlayStation 5 later this year, is one of the most anticipated launch titles for the console.\n\nWith the original Demon's Souls being more than a decade old, there are a lot of possible improvements when bringing the game forward into the next generation. We fired up both the original Demon's Souls to compare it to the PS5 remake, and the results are pretty impressive. Check out the video above to see both games running side by side through cutscenes, combat, and the tutorial boss fight.\n\nWe've got plenty of coverage of the PS5 and the next generation of consoles and more coming as we approach their launch this holiday season, so stay tuned to GameSpot.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ye3RWH26bVA", "date_published": "2020-09-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Makes HUGE Moves | Generation Next", "description": "It's been an absolutely huge week for Xbox. Opening preorders up for Xbox Series X and Series S alone would have been a momentous occasion for the company, but ahead of doing that it dropped a bombshell: Xbox has acquired ZeniMax Media. The purchase includes Bethesda, and properties such as The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Dishonored, and Wolfenstein, among others.\n\nIn this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor talk about the implications of Xbox's acquisition, what it means for PlayStation 5 exclusives that the company was working on, and the impact it could have on Game Pass. They also look at what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadela has said previously and discuss whether Xbox could make further acquisitions.\u00a0\n\nOf course, the crew also cover Xbox's preorder process which, while not as disastrous as PlayStation's, still was much rougher than most people would have liked. Retailers struggled to meet demands and, in some cases, outright didn't make preorders for the Series X and S available at the time prescribed by Microsoft. Were Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor able to get one? Watch and find out.\u00a0\n\nGeneration Next is GameSpot's dedicated show that's all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
