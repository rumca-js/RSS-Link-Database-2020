Adherence to the test, trace and isolate system 
(National Institute for Health Research, Public Health England, King’s College London, University of East Anglia, 18th September)

Need for people with a persistent new onset cough, fever or loss of their sense of taste or smell to: 
Remain at home for at least seven days from the onset of their symptoms
Request an antigen test
Provide details of their close contacts to a dedicated service if the test result is positive
Close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to remain at home for 14 days from the time of their contact
2 March to 5 August 2020 

N = 42,127

Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high temperature / fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste)

48.9% of participants identified key symptoms of COVID-19

Self-reported adherence to self- isolation if symptomatic

18.2%

Requesting an antigen test if symptomatic

11.9%

Intention to share details of close contacts

76.1%

Self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact with a 
confirmed COVID-19 case 

10.9%

Non-adherence was associated with:

Men

Younger age groups

Having a dependent child in the household

Lower socio- economic grade

Greater hardship during the pandemic

Working in a key sector. 

Conclusions

Practical support and financial reimbursement is likely to improve adherence

Targeting messaging


Covid-19 sniffer dogs

Four dogs working at Helsinki airport

State-funded pilot scheme

If it works, it could prove a good screening method in other places 

After dog indicates infection, PCR testing is carried out

Nearly 100% accuracy, even days before symptoms

Dogs are also able to identify Covid-19 from a much smaller samples than PCR tests

Dogs can sniff 10-100 molecules to detect the presence of the virus

The preliminary results in the first round show that a majority of our nation, more than 90% of the population, remains susceptible

Expects there to be about 700 million doses of vaccines available by April

I think that's going to take us April, May, June, possibly July

to get the entire American public completely vaccinated

Companies have begun manufacturing vaccines

Dr. Fauci, expects 50 million doses to be available in November

100 million by the end of December

Cases rising

COVID-19 is the underlying cause of death (Died FROM)

COVID-19 may be present on the death certificate as a significant condition contributing to death but not the underlying cause (Died WITH)

Using, Public health England data

Up to 1st June

Early weeks

COVID -19 was the underlying cause of death in 92.2% of deaths (Died FROM)

i.e. 7.8% did not have the disease as the underlying cause of death (Died WITH)

Last 8 weeks
Up to 28th August, underlying cause in 71.2% of deaths (Died FROM) 

i.e. 28.8% of deaths not directly caused by COVID-19 (Died WITH)

Scotland

Early weeks, up to 1st June

COVID-19 was the underlying cause in 94.6% of death (Died FROM)

i.e. 5.4 % did not have the disease as the underlying cause of death (Died WITH)

Worms and COVID in Africa

https://www.news-medical.net/news/20200519/Do-parasites-protect-against-SARS-CoV-2.aspx

Inflammation in severe clinical cases of COVID-19

Worms reduce inflammation and the immune response

Multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, allergic and autoimmune diseases

Immunomodulators in Parasitic Infestation

Infections last for years

Host often does not become very sick

Parasite counts can remain stable

Therefore, parasitic incidence could be responsible for the low number of symptomatic cases and deaths in Africa

Parasites and their protection against COVID-19- Ecology or Immunology?

Methods: 

COVID-19 cases in comparison to data on helminths and malaria

Results: 

Africa COVID

0.029 out of 3.3 million (0.88%) cases

1,064 out of 238,628 (0.45%) deaths.

Africa Parasites

213 out of 229 million (93%) of all malaria cases globally

204 out of 229 million (89%) of schistosomiasis cases

271 out of 1068 million (25%) of soil-transmitted helminth cases

Europe COVID

1.5 out of 3.3 million (45%) of global cases

142,667 out of 238,628 (59%) deaths

Europe Parasites

Malaria no cases

Schistosomiasis no cases

5.8 out of 1068 million (0.55%) soil-transmitted helminths cases

Inverse correlation between the incidence of COVID-19 and malaria 

Inverse correlation between the incidence COVID-19 and soil-transmitted helminths

Countries with endemic malaria, soil-transmitted helminths and schistosomiasis had less COVID-19

Populations who migrate from endemic parasitic infestation lose their parasites

Studies to elucidate the relationship between parasitic infections and susceptibility to COVID-19 at an individual level are warranted
