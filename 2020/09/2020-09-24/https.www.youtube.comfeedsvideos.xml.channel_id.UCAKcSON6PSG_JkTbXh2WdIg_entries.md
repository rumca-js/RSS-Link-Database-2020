This Friday, Sept. 25, The War and Treaty will release their new album, "Hearts Town." In anticipation of that, we're sharing three awesome, live performances that the War and Treaty — duo Michael and Tanya Trotter — have performed for us. We'll start with a 2018 performance in our studio, followed by another that lifted the roof off the Fitzgerald Theater in 2018, and concluding with a stripped-down performance of "Five More Minutes," the hit single of the forthcoming record.
