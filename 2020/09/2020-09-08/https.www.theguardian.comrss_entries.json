Small wonder that so many people take a pragmatic \u2013 rather than a moral-based \u2013 approach and choose to simply \u201cdo what they\u2019ve got to do\u201d. Managing your libido while trying to maintain a long-distance relationship is a torturous effort, so try to be more accepting of your human condition. In my view there is nothing inherently wrong with using erotic online material \u2013 especially if it helps you avoid seeking live contact that could potentially cause you more problems. You will know if you are overdoing it, as you will feel so compulsively driven to view porn that it will significantly interfere with the rest of your life. The prospect of \u201cinfidelity\u201d is always going to appeal in fantasy \u2013 since forbidden sex tends to be highly erotic \u2013 but there are certainly potential risks (your distant partner may well be facing similar impossible choices).
