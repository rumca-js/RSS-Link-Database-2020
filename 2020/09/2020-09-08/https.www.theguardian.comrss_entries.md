Trump was “frankly unfit to hold the office of president of the United States”.<br /></p><p>Two years later, as foreign secretary, Johnson’s position had evolved somewhat. He told the US ambassador that President Trump was doing “<a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/boris-johnson-told-us-diplomats-donald-trump-america-great-secret-notes-633737">fantastic stuff</a>” and “making America great again”. In a meeting of British business leaders in July 2018, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/brexit-boris-johnson-donald-trump-all-sorts-of-chaos-says/">Johnson recognised</a> that Trump showed signs of madness, but admired the method in it.

## I’m in a long-distance relationship – will porn stop me being unfaithful?

<p>I don’t really like using porn, but I am worried that if I stop, I will start looking for sex with other people <br /></p><p><strong>I am a gay man </strong><strong>with a long-term partner. He recently moved </strong><strong>away so we are </strong><strong>currently in a long-distance relationship. </strong><strong>We have mostly good sex when we are together, although my sex drive is normally higher than his. When I am alone, </strong><strong>with little to do, I become bored and instantly think of masturbating</strong><strong>. I normally turn to porn, although I don’t really like it</strong><strong>; I prefer the feeling of real sex or even video-sex with my partner. But I don’t know how to break my porn habit.</strong><strong> I have gone some months without it before but always come back to it; </strong><strong>I feel a bit addicted</strong><strong>. </strong><strong> I </strong><strong>have also thought of </strong><strong>having</strong><strong> sex with other people in my home town, but this would mean </strong><strong>having a discussion </strong><strong>about an open relationship, which I doubt either I or my partner would be comfortable with. </strong><strong>This leaves infidelity, which I would not strive for but occasionally dream about. Essentially, I have a high sex drive, am bored and like sex. How do I channel this in a positive way?</strong></p><p>You are experiencing the perennial challenge faced by every sexually alive human being: “How can I navigate the expectations of my partner, my family, myself, and of the society in which I live, and get my needs met at the same time?” Many people can find a favourable answer to this question for a portion of their lives – but most feel that they are more often than not at war with their bodily desires. Small wonder that so many people take a pragmatic – rather than a moral-based – approach and choose to simply “do what they’ve got to do”. Managing your libido while trying to maintain a long-distance relationship is a torturous effort, so try to be more accepting of your human condition. In my view there is nothing inherently wrong with using erotic online material – especially if it helps you avoid seeking live contact that could potentially cause you more problems. You will know if you are overdoing it, as you will feel so compulsively driven to view porn that it will significantly interfere with the rest of your life. The prospect of “infidelity” is always going to appeal in fantasy – since forbidden sex tends to be highly erotic – but there are certainly potential risks (your distant partner may well be facing similar impossible choices). Just do the best you can.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/08/im-in-a-long-distance-relationship-will-porn-stop-me-being-unfaithful">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Love blossoms between a young black man and a middle-aged white mother in Hornby’s assured, if cosy, new novel</p><p>In this age of anxiety about cultural appropriation and suchlike, kudos to Nick Hornby’s bold move in <em>Just Like You</em>. He narrates one half of it from the point of view of a working-class black man in his early 20s and the other half from the point of view of a 42-year-old middle-class white mother. And, what’s more, he makes a social comedy of the two of them falling in love, one that gently dramatises their differences of class, race and generation.</p><p>Joseph is broke and a bit aimless. He lives with his God-fearing old mum, coaches football in his spare time and works in a north London butcher’s shop while nursing dreams of making it big as a DJ. One of his regular customers is Lucy, head of English at a local school, mother of two boys and separated from Paul.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/08/just-like-you-review-nick-hornby-tackles-race-romance-and-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are more philanthropists than ever before. Each year they give tens of billions to charitable causes. So how come inequality keeps rising? By Paul Vallely</p><p>Philanthropy, it is popularly supposed, transfers money from the rich to the poor. This is not the case. In the US, which statistics show to be the most philanthropic of nations, barely a fifth of the money donated by big givers goes to the poor. A lot goes to the arts, sports teams and other cultural pursuits, and half goes to education and healthcare. At first glance that seems to fit the popular profile of “giving to good causes”. But dig down a little.</p><p>The biggest donations in education in 2019 went to the elite universities and schools that the rich themselves had attended. In the UK, in the 10-year period to 2017, more than two-thirds of all millionaire donations – £4.79bn – went to higher education, and half of these went to just two universities: Oxford and Cambridge. When the rich and the middle classes give to schools, they give more to those attended by their own children than to those of the poor. British millionaires in that same decade gave £1.04bn to the arts, and just £222m to alleviating poverty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/08/how-philanthropy-benefits-the-super-rich">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Was Rule, Britannia! going to be dropped from the Last Night of the Proms in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement? Apparently not, and yet Boris Johnson was moved to comment on the story. Guardian columnist Nesrine Malik looks at how culture wars have entered mainstream politics </p><p>This Saturday will be the annual Last Night of the Proms. The classical music event has been in the headlines recently with reports that the BBC were discussing ditching Rule, Britannia! in the wake of the Black Lives Matter movement. Apparently organisers were concerned about a backlash because of the perceived connection to colonialism and slavery. </p><p>But, says Guardian columnist <strong>Nesrine Malik</strong>, the story was not actually true. There was only going to be an orchestral version because of the pandemic and the fact there will be no audience to sing along. She tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> why she thinks it wasn’t an innocent misunderstanding, but the result of a desire to exaggerate the threat to “our culture” from the unnamed vandals set on destroying it. Culture war skirmishes, Malik believes, are how rightwing electoral prospects are now advanced: not through policies or promises of a better life, but by fostering a sense of threat, a fantasy that something profoundly pure and British is constantly at risk of extinction. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/08/rule-britannia-and-the-manufacturing-of-culture-wars-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
