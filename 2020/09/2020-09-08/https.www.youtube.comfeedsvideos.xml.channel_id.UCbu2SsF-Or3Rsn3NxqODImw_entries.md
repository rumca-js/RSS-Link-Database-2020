Games are hard to make and don't always get released with their original vision intact. From Assassin's Creed to Donkey Kong, here are 7 games that you might not know used to be something else entirely.

00:00 Intro
00:21 Assassin's Creed was Prince of Persia
01:38 Halo was an RTS
02:35 Devil May Cry was originally Resident Evil 4
03:18 Donkey Kong was Popeye
03:58 Splinter Cell was pitched as a Bond game
04:54 Borderlands' original art style was very... anti-Borderlands
05:32 The original plans for BioShock were wild 

BioShock originally began life as a very ambitious game about a cult deprogrammer, with an asymmetrical multiplayer mode that would see you play as a monster in another player's story mode. Assassin's Creed was originally a follow up to Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time, and its name used to be Prince of Persia: Assassins, before the Prince was dropped completely. 

There are countless more examples, and the video above explores 7 games that were something else entirely.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, developed by Treyarch in partnership with Raven Software, is this year's entry into the wildly popular annual shooter franchise. In this video we look at how it two can exist alongside the robust Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Cold War’s multiplayer includes the larger 12 v 12 Combined Arms mode, which features the Armada map with ziplines and ship to ship combat as well as a tense 6 v 6 VIP Escort mode that's more reminiscent of Counter-Strike. In this video we also take a look at Create-a-Class including loadouts, some of the better weapons you can start with, useful perks, and the standard fare of scorestreaks. Some of the maps are unique such as one set in 1980’s Miami, a snow map called Crossroads, and the aforementioned Armada map completely set in the ocean. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is confirmed to be a cross-gen and cross-play title. It will have a battle pass system as well as free post-launch content such as maps, modes, and in-game events. Progression from multiplayer will feed into Warzone including new items to be used in both games. Cold War is out November 13th for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC with later releases on next-gen consoles PS5 and Xbox Series X.

We got our hands on Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War's multiplayer! One of the new modes included in our preview was "VIP Escort". In this game mode, you either play as a team escorting a VIP, or the opposing team whose mission is to eliminate the VIP. The VIP is a randomly selected playable character, and is controlled either by you or someone on your team.

When you play as the VIP, your only weapon is a handgun, so relying on your team mates to get you to the exfil point is key. In our first match on the "Miami" map, we take control of the VIP and are escorted safely by our team. Our second and third matches take place in a large snow map called "Crossroads". Despite an attack of the middle of the map, our team eliminates the VIP just as he's preparing to leave. In our third match, our mission is to again eliminate the enemy VIP. In an awesome last-minute play, the VIP is sniped just before he's able to escape! 

Got questions about Cold War's multiplayer experience? Be on the lookout for our upcoming video where our very own Michael Higham answers questions based on his experience with his playtime. Everything from guns used, map design, perks and more.
