On Wednesday, Sept. 9, Mason Jennings will be a guest on The Current Morning Show.

In the summer of 2016, Davina and the Vagabonds were fresh off a 10-day residency at the Edinburgh Jazz and Blues Festival (a festival that has welcomed the Minneapolis band in years before and all since) when they visited the MPR booth at the Minnesota State Fair to play songs for a live audience. The Minnesota State Fair didn't happen in 2020, but hearing these awesome performances of lively songs will stir hope that the Great Minnesota Get-Together will reconvene again someday.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Red Shoes" 
2:45 "Pocket" 
5:52 "Sunshine"

PERSONNEL
Davina Sowers – piano, vocals
