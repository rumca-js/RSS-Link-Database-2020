For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, he assembled his full band, Good Company, for the first time since the global pandemic cancelled their tour last spring. They rehearsed the day before this capture at Assorted Studios in York, Penn., the midway point between the members' hometowns of Philadelphia, New York City and Washington D.C. They picked this facility because it felt more like a living room than a studio. And to make it feel as cozy as possible, they brought memorabilia from their own homes. Bass player Dennis Turner brought family photos, Ralph Real (on the Fender Rhodes) brought his son's toy drum set, and Oddisee brought tribal statues from Sudan.\n\nThe five captivating songs are from his new EP, Odd Cure, \"a record I didn't want to write but needed to,\" Oddisee said in July. He wrote it in eight weeks, between March and May, while in self-isolation. He had just returned from a performance in Thailand and wanted to protect his family. Oddisee says these songs were inspired by the deluge of news, social media, misinformation and conspiracy theories generated during the first weeks of the pandemic. Relevant and inspiring, his music and its message addresses the uncertainty and anxiety we all live with today.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Cure\"\n\"Shoot Your Shot\"\n\"I Thought You Were Fate\"\n\"Still Strange\"\n\"Go To Mars\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nOddisee: vocals; Ralph Real: vocals, Rhodes; Olivier St.Louis: vocals, guitar; Jon Laine: drums, vocals; Dennis Turner: bass; DJ Unown: MPC; Saint Ezekiel: guitar: Priya Ragu; vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo by: Keith Charles, Lawrence Miner; Audio by: Delf; Producer: Suraya Mohamed; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\nABOUT THE SERIES\n\nThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.\n\nOpening with this summer's inescapable \"Dynamite\" \u2014 the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English \u2014 BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, \"Uptown Funk\"-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive \"Save ME,\" from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective \"Spring Day.\"\n\nThe latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (\"It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come\"), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.\n\nBTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, \"Spring Day\" provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dynamite\"\n\"Save ME\"\n\"Spring Day\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJ-Hope: vocals; SUGA: vocals; Jungkook: vocals; V: vocals; Jin: vocals; RM: vocals; Jimin: vocals;  KHAN: drums; DOCSKIM: keyboard; Kim Kiwook: bass; Shyun: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo and Audio by: Big Hit Entertainment; Producer: Stephen Thompson; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Subtitles by Renee Klahr; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\nABOUT THE SERIES\nThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.
