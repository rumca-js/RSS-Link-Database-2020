No community spread for over 5 months

Strict border controls

Secured hotel quarantine for 14 days

catching a few positive cases every week, but not getting into the community

Never had strict broad lockdowns, although early on we did have pubs, clubs, massage parlours, etc closed and many people working from home.

Have and still are using social distancing in shops, but no masks

Friday to Monday

To make it clear that the virus is airborne

Once said the virus is only spread by coughs and sneezes, less than six feet 

Infection, breathing, infected particles can travel further than six feet

Linger in the air

WHO

Transmission of SARS-CoV-2: implications for infection prevention precautions

https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/transmission-of-sars-cov-2-implications-for-infection-prevention-precautions

Respiratory droplets bigger than 5 - 10 μm

Smaller than 5μm, droplet nuclei or aerosols

Respiratory droplet transmission, within 1 metre

of an infected person who has respiratory symptoms

Aerosol-generating procedures

To date, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by this type of aerosol route has not been demonstrated

Talking about cluster evidence

However, the detailed investigations of these clusters suggest that droplet and fomite transmission could also explain human-to-human transmission within these clusters.

Counter argument

Airborne transmission of covid-19

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3206

Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, research in aerobiology, physics, and computational fluid dynamics has advanced our understanding of aerosol generation and the carriage and fate of respiratory particles

239 scientists signed an open letter appealing to the medical community and relevant national and international bodies to recognise the potential for airborne spread of covid-19

Cases, 5, 562, 662

Deaths 88, 935

https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-indias-public-health-system-on-the-verge-of-collapse/a-54978362

Health system overwhelmed

Chaos in places

Shortage of medical staff and equipment

Government hospitals at capacity

Delhi 

Orders 33 private hospitals to reserve 80% of ICU beds

Cases, 230,000

Cases, + 4,000 for past eight days

No ICU beds in eight of 11 top private hospitals

Many patients are unable to find a place in hospitals
 
Mumbai

Third of normal hospital beds still unoccupied

Hospitals busy, ICU scarce

Indian government

Reopened gyms, most workplaces, markets, bars

Cinemas closed

Schools and colleges now reopening

Death tole likely to spine in next few weeks

Distance among children

Up to 12, do not have to stay 1.5 metres apart from each other or from adults

17 and younger, do not have to stay 1.5 metres apart from each other

Source and contact tracing, testing and staying home

COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever, shortness of breath or coughing, stay at home until the symptoms have been gone for 24 hours

Children do not need to be tested, unless they are seriously ill

Preventing the virus from spreading in childcare facilities and schools

Hygiene, hands and frequent touch points, respiratory 

Ventilation and airing out indoor spaces

It is important to properly ventilate homes, businesses and other buildings, such as schools

Face masks and gloves

https://www.rivm.nl/en/novel-coronavirus-covid-19/face-masks-and-gloves

The literature does not offer a clear consensus on the effect of wearing non-medical face masks in public spaces

It seems likely that face masks help prevent infecting others, but only to a limited extent

If everyone follows the basic rules, it is not necessary to wear a face mask

OMT is not issuing a general recommendation to wear face masks in public spaces

Droplets, aerosols, surface contacts

Hands face space

Limit the number of our contacts

Reduce contacts in closed spaces, crowds, poor ventilation

Reduce contact with infected people, isolation

Spain and France

Younger people now older as well

Cases - hospitalization – deaths

Viral genetics have changed, but still causes disease and deaths

UK

Increases in all age groups

Not just more testing

ONS data

Proportion of tests positives increasing

+ 6,000 = 70, 000 currently have infection

App data

+ 10, 391 = 96, 531

Doubling every 7 days

Mid October

Cases, + 50, 000 

1 month later 200 + deaths per day

Now

Speed, action, enough

Current immunity

8% show antibodies

17% in London

3 million people

Most not protected

Geographical spread

Varies but essentially all over

Clusters have been getting bigger

Increasing everywhere

In patients

Doubling time, 7 or 8 days

Potential for hospitalisations and deaths to double many times

Seasons are against us for all respiratory viruses

6 month problem to deal with

Collective problem

No evidence the virus is milder than April

Mortality will be similar to what we have seen, slightly lower

High numbers would mean;

Direct COVID deaths

NHS overwhelmed

Other pathologies not being treated, early diagnosis

Heath effects of restrictions

If I increase my risk, I increase the risks to others

What to do

Reducing individual risk, hands face space

Isolation

Break unnecessary links between households, work and social

Science

Vaccines

Many vaccines generate an immune response

First half of next year
