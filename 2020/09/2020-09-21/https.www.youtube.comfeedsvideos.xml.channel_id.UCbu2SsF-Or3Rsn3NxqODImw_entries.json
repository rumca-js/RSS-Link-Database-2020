Microsoft has purchased ZeniMax Media, the parent company of Bethesda. This landmark acquisition is going to have a significant impact on the future of video games so, just moments after the announcement, Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan sat down to talk about the implications.\n\nFor context, this is one of Microsoft's most expensive recent acquisitions, with the company spending more on Bethesda than it did on Minecraft. The $7.5 billion is even more than Disney spent on Marvel and Lucasfilm, which really drives home the value it sees in ZeniMax Media's subsidiary studios. \n\nFor those unaware, the acquisition means Bethesda Softworks, Bethesda Game Studios, id Software, ZeniMax Online Studios, Arkane, MachineGames, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog join the Xbox family, bringing with them franchises like The Elder Scrolls, Doom, Dishonored, and Wolfenstein, among many others. \n\nSo, what does it all mean? Watch this episode of Generation Next and find out. The gang covers everything from the particulars of the acquisition to the impact it'll have on Game Pass, and what it means for existing exclusivity deals with PlayStation, as well as how these studio purchases align with Xbox boss Phil Spencer's ethos of making gaming available to anyone and everyone. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:49 - Acquisition Cost + All Xbox Studios\n05:01 - Console Exclusivity\n06:59 - Game Pass + Starfield\n10:13 - Bethesda Games on PS+?\n11:19 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL_oruLNiMw", "date_published": "2020-09-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Preorders Were Almost As Bad As PS5's | Save State", "description": "Much like PS5 or RTX 3080, Xbox Series X & S preorders were a mess.
