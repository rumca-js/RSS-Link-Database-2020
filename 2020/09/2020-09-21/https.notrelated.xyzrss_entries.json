[{"source": "https://notrelated.xyz/rss", "title": "Myth as History: Rohl's New Chronology", "description": "<p>In one fell swoop, Egyptologist David Rohl has posited a change in Egyptian chronology that takes both Greek mythical history and the stories of the Bible out of idle lore and into historical plausibility.</p><p>By cutting and rearranging some 300 years of \"dark ages,\" Rohl suggests that there is no gap between the legendary times of the Trojan War and the later historical Dorian Invasion. He also posits that very specific Biblical stories, such as the sojourn in Egypt, Exodus, the conquest of Canaan and the Kingdom of Israel have ample historical evidence if we start looking in Egypt's Middle Kingdom Period.</p><p>Note also that you can now support\u00a0<em>Not Related!</em> by donating at <a href=\"https://donate.notrelated.xyz\">donate.notrelated.xyz</a>.
