The Roadmachines Mono-Rail may have been the only truly useful, fit-for-purpose monorail in the world. Of the hundreds that were built, most were never meant for passengers. But they did carry a couple of famous people in their time, including a certain secret agent...

Thank you to the staff and volunteers at the Amberley Museum - Harry and Gerry in particular - for running the monorail specially, and letting me film! The Amberley Museum is a massive industrial heritage museum in the South Downs, and you can find out more about them here: https://www.amberleymuseum.co.uk/

There are lots more videos of Amberley's rail vehicles at the volunteers' channel here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMHTdXU7cfBdNBzdVkgaIrQ

My research is heavily based on David Voice's "Mono-Rail: The History of the Industrial Monorails Made By Road Machines Ltd., Metalair Ltd and Rail Machines Ltd", ISBN 1874422877, available from Adam Gordon Books: http://www.ahgbooks.com/index.php/product/mono-rail/

Thanks to Derry Faux-Nightingale for the initial idea!
