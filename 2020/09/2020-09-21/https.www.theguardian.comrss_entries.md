## Edwin van der Sar: 'I want every fan to have a second love for Ajax'

<p>The Dutch club’s chief understands their place in the football hierarchy but wants to keep their unique place on the global stage</p><p>Edwin van der Sar can still picture the bemusement on the faces of Ryan Giggs and Paul Scholes, his Manchester United teammates at the time and resolute one-club men. The Dutch goalkeeper, who arrived at Old Trafford in 2005 via Ajax, Juventus and Fulham, had wanted to know whether either fancied playing abroad. They could learn a new language, Van der Sar suggested, experience different cultures and climates, maybe even earn more money.</p><p>The short answer was no. Why would they do that? They were at a big club – their club in their city – with family and friends close by, winning big trophies and being paid big money. They had it all. “OK, the weather in Manchester,” Van der Sar says, with a smile. “But Paul said: ‘I don’t like the sun.’ I think David [Beckham] is one of the few [English players] that left United but he came from London.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/22/edwin-van-der-sar-interview-ajax-manchester-united-van-de-beek">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ghost-hunters descend on beleaguered couple Mike and Alison’s country pile, as the grownup comedy from the Horrible Histories team returns for more crude yet clever laughs</p><p>The wonderfully barmy <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08qysm5">Ghosts</a> (BBC One) is back for a second series, and it remains a riot of high-energy slapstick and silliness. To recap: young, broke couple Mike and Alison were thrown a lifeline in the hellish business of trying to find an affordable home, when Alison’s distant relative died and left her a majestic manor called Button House. However, the inheritance came with some hitchhikers, in the form of the restless spirits of many of the house’s previous inhabitants. I have seen so many estate agent listings for outrageously priced flats with toilets in the kitchen, beds suspended from the ceiling and a view that consists of a window into another box room, that at this stage I would take all of the ghosts that history could fling at me.</p><p>After a bumpy beginning, the first series settled the differences between humans and spectres, to some extent, and the living couple have found something approaching harmony with their less corporeal counterparts. Their dream of selling Button Hall and turning it into a five-star hotel and spa has hit the bumpers, what with the plague pit in the basement putting off potential buyers, and money is tighter than ever. They decide to rent out some of the bigger rooms for events, but the trouble is, well, the ghosts. This is, essentially, the crux of every episode, but the writing is so sharp that it almost always feels fresh.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/21/ghosts-series-two-review-another-dose-of-high-spirited-silliness">Continue reading...</a>

## The next act: how the pandemic is shaping online theatre's future

<p>The explosion of digital productions of all sizes has shown great creativity and made hit shows more accessible – but is it all financially sustainable?</p><p>In the past six months, theatre has offered us comfort, provocation and entertainment. Not always live theatre, of course, but a virtual subgenre emerging out of pandemic darkness in the form of online dramas. These productions have ranged from splashy, multi-camera films of existing shows to quick-response plays made on a shoestring and beamed into our living rooms as dramatised video calls, aural dramas, interactive Zoom plays and monologues about lockdown life. Where is the place of such drama now that live theatre is whirring back into motion? Will we continue to sit in front of our screens rather than making our way back to auditoriums or has this virtual substitute served its purpose?</p><p>There is compelling evidence to suggest that the archive arm of online theatre – films of the plays – has secured an expanded place in the industry. The National Theatre’s NT at Home scheme was one of the biggest virtual successes of lockdown; it screened 17 productions and garnered more than 15m views from audiences in more than 170 countries. Here was entertainment for the masses, creating the same event-theatre moment as a live show but on a global scale, and free of charge (with an option to donate). It brought some redress to an art form often deemed too expensive and stuck in an elite bubble. The filmed version of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/30/hamilton-review-disney-plus-lin-manuel-miranda">Hamilton</a> had a similar effect. For the price of a subscription to the Disney+ channel, we could watch a musical whose ticket prices would have been beyond the reach of many in its live incarnation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/21/future-of-live-theatre-online-drama-coronavirus-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Charlotte, 52 and Calvin Dorion, 51, met while working as Santa’s elves in Australia. They now live together in Victoria on Vancouver Island</p><p>When Charlotte Lumsden arrived for a backpacking trip around Australia in November 1992, she realised she would need a job. “I’d spent all my money on the flight,” she says. While staying at a hostel in Kings Cross, Sydney, she was told that “Santa” was recruiting elves for a sales job. “The job was basically to dress up as an elf and go to houses, markets and office blocks around Australia selling stuffed toys.” On her first day she met Calvin, a Canadian traveller, who had also signed up to make some extra cash. “All I remember is that her sneakers were too big. She was really attractive but had these massive shoes,” he says.</p><p>The pair began a selling road trip with a group of other elves. Their transport and accommodation were paid for. Over the next two weeks, they got to know each other. “He was so gentlemanly,” says Charlotte. “I was scared of dogs so when we went to try and sell toys at houses, he would protect me from the dogs so I could sell.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/21/how-we-met-we-would-snog-by-the-side-of-the-road-in-our-elf-costumes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a world first, Rotterdam’s Boijmans museum has put its entire collection on display in a mammoth new warehouse. As the V&amp;A considers a similar experiment, is this ‘open storage’ model the future? </p><p>From a block away, it looks like a craft from a more advanced civilisation has landed in the centre of Rotterdam. The structure is futuristic, with walls of mirrored glass curving up some 40 metres, reflecting the iron-grey clouds and the fractured city skyline. It wouldn’t be surprising if it had a tractor beam instead of a door. As I draw close, a middle-aged Dutch couple are debating whether they like it.

<p>Chemical headaches, plant sirens – these were the constant background to my home and school life. My community is on the climate frontline<br /></p><p>My teacher first taught me about global warming in the third grade. She explained how an increase in greenhouse gases increased the amount of heat that could be trapped in our atmosphere. We discussed how climate change is melting the ice caps polar bears call home, leading to their extinction. We didn’t discuss how the climate crisis was already at our homes.</p><p>I grew up with the smell of freshly made salsa from chiles picked from our backyard garden, the bright colors of fruit gifted to us by neighbors, and the sound of off-key singing to Joan Sebastian and Selena Quintanilla.

<p>Sicily’s famous fortified wine makes for a versatile ingredient – and lends this sponge the flavours of <em>zabaione</em></p><p>If I could afford it, I would always have a bottle of <a href="https://www.marcodebartoli.com/en/">marsala made by the De Bartoli family</a> on my shelf. When there <em>is</em> one there, there is no one I would rather share it with than my partner Vincenzo’s parents, Bartolomeo and Carmela: for their bright glee at the sight of the bottle, the twisting squeaks of its cork, its escaping scent, its amber glow and that first sip, like almonds and iodine, caramel and wood. Also, marsala is not called a fortified wine for nothing: sips are warm and strengthening, not that my mother-in-law needs any assistance when going into battle over a game of cards.</p><p>Marsala, named after the Sicilian city in the western province of Trapani, varies hugely according to who made it, much like any wine. Its character is defined by the grape from which it is made – most commonly white (catarratto, grillo, inzolia), although sometimes red – and how the nature of that grape is encouraged or manipulated by the grower and maker. The grape used affects the colour, too; you might see marsala defined as<em> oro (</em>gold), <em>ambra </em>(amber)<em> </em>or <em>rubino </em>(ruby)<em>,</em> but bear in mind that the colour can also be affected by additions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/21/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-marsala-cake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prevalence of coronavirus in large urban areas plays into the hands of those prosecuting a rightwing culture war</p><p>It’s both true and a little obvious to say that coronavirus knows no borders. But it’s important to point out that neither is it much concerned with established cliches about the internal geography of the UK. There has been no clearcut “north-south divide” in the spread of the pandemic throughout England, for example. Indeed, if anything, the narrative of recent months has emphasised that traditional notions about England’s social and political makeup are becoming increasingly irrelevant and outdated.</p><p>Our cultural landscape is changing. In place of a 20th-century discourse that viewed England as a land of mega-regions – like north and south – and saw a great cultural faultline between industrial and non-industrial areas, coronavirus is combining with political developments to highlight a new and very different reality.

<p>Roast wood pigeon, stuffed squash, and mushrooms on roast garlic toast: dishes to welcome in the new season<br /></p><p>It feels a long time since that glorious spring, when I ate outside day after day. Autumn has come quickly this year (I was sweeping up crisp, brown leaves in July) and with it, a change of step in the kitchen. The lush green of summer has turned to yellow, orange and brown, the spice jars are down from the shelf, the deep casseroles and baking dishes have come out to play.</p><p>Tomatoes, which I seem to have eaten every day this summer, are now destined for the oven rather than the salad bowl, their juices seasoned with thyme rather than basil, or perhaps paprika or harissa. The mushrooms I marinated in a dressing of lemon juice, olive oil and tarragon are now more likely to appear sliced and fried with thyme and butter and piled on to thick toast. The courgettes have finished and I have moved on to the early autumn squashes, the small ones shaped like Chinese dumplings or ridged like the rim of an apple pie.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/21/nigel-slater-autumn-recipes-roast-wood-pigeon-stuffed-squash-mushrooms-garlic-toast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chelsea’s youngsters are back on the sidelines, former Blues defender Tariq Lamptey shines in win and Eddie Nketiah has his eye on goals</p><p>Much of the praise heaped on Frank Lampard about this time last year focused on his apparent eagerness to find a place in the first-team setup for the academy graduates that had been rendered collateral damage by the money and splendour of the Abramovich era. But against Liverpool, the spearhead of last season’s locally sourced side, Tammy Abraham, was consigned to the bench by the £47m Timo Werner and the £72m Kai Havertz was picked ahead of Callum Hudson-Odoi, whose mettle will be further tested when Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic are fit. Ruben Loftus-Cheek was not in the squad at all. Fikayo Tomori’s emergency introduction was the first time he had kicked a ball since February. And Mason Mount is playing in the position preferred by Havertz. Suddenly Lampard’s new-look Chelsea begin to resemble the old one: expensive signings, a squad overflowing with pedigree – and a manager who needs to get results in the here and now. <strong>Alex Hess<br />• </strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/20/chelsea-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Match report: Chelsea 0-2 Liverpool</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/21/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

Her matriarch Moira is simply one of the best characters to ever appear on screen, from her wigs to her dauntless self-centredness, but the true masterstroke is her accent.

The couple from San Francisco had just been people-watching around the Cascada, an impressive fountain in the northern corner of the park, looking on as happy couples took their wedding photos. As they left, they were surprised to see the oak. “It’s growing out of the concrete,” says Bain. “It’s like walking up a staircase and having to walk around someone, and in this case that someone was a tree.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/21/tree-of-the-week-the-oak-that-sat-down-on-some-stairs-and-stayed">Continue reading...</a>

It is about £1,600 a month. I may have to give up my job to look after a relative.<br /><strong>SA</strong></p><p><strong>A</strong> The short answer is no. There are very few mortgage lenders who are prepared to take income from lodgers into account when working out how much they are prepared to lend. And, according to Pete Mugleston of <a href="https://www.onlinemortgageadvisor.co.uk/">onlinemortgageadvisor.co.uk</a>, “even lenders who do accept lodger income are unlikely to offer you a mortgage if you are unemployed and have no other sources of income”. Mugleston adds: “In fact, most lenders who accept lodger income stipulate that your total employed earnings must be at least £20,000 to £25,000 a year.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/sep/21/can-i-get-a-mortgage-if-my-only-income-is-from-lodgers">Continue reading...</a>

That’s OK.” It’s the creed of a grovelling lap dog, and Trump follows up with flattering licks and whiny appeals to have his belly scratched. “Honey, I’m talking to Bob Woodward!” he proudly announces when Melania interrupts one of their phone calls, and he even imparts whispered nuclear secrets in the hope that this upright, fanatically factual journalist – who began his career<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/12/woodward-bernstein-watergate-donald-trump-era"> by exposing the Watergate burglary</a> and thus scuttled Nixon’s presidency – will relax into an obsequious court reporter. Yet when closeted with his harried aides or beleaguered cabinet members, Trump mutates into the carnivorous hound of the Baskervilles.

## The art of tantra: is there more to it than marathon sex and massages?

<p>The west reduced tantra to a quest for sexual liberation and wellness. But a new show charts its darker depths – from avenging goddesses to blood-drinking and self-decapitation</p><p>Make a cursory web search for the term tantra and you will be confronted with thousands of results providing “tips on how to practise tantric sex”, paeans to “the art of tantric massage” and listicles on the choicest “tantric sex positions for you and your partner”. You might be forgiven for thinking you had strayed into an X-rated section of the internet.</p><p>Yet tantra is a spiritual philosophy that originated in the Indian subcontinent and dates back to at least the 8th century AD. Meaning “to weave” in Sanskrit, tantra has since found its way into everything from Hinduism and Buddhism to western pop culture. With a focus on worshipping previously non-canonical and non-caste-based Hindu goddesses such as Kali and Chinnamasta, the tantric belief sees the world as imbued with a divine feminine energy – “shakti” – that we must access if we are to transcend our own ego and reach an enlightened liberation from the cycle of reincarnation. To access this energy, certain tantric practitioners believe in performing sexual rites, as well as confronting their own revulsions by covering themselves in funereal ash, drinking blood and wearing aprons made of human bones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/21/tantra-british-museum-marathon-sex-massages">Continue reading...</a>
