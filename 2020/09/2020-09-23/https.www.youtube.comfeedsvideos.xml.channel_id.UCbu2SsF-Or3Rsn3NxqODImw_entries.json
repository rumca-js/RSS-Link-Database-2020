There hasn't been any announcement of new Metal Gear Solid PC ports, but Konami has repackaged PC ports in the past and has already re-released Metal Gear Solid titles in past collections. Tokyo Game Show is this weekend and Konami is scheduled for two panels where we might get more details.\n\nPersia also talks about Nintendo renewing its trademarks for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver. Japanese trademarks typically expire after 10 years of being filed, which corresponds with the game's lifespan. The renewal includes various products and services, but there's no mention of games.\n\nAnd lastly, Persia covers Nintendo accidentally leaking Kirby Fighters 2 on its Game Finder tool. The Game Finder tool is designed to help parents pick Nintendo games for their kids. According to the listing, in Kirby Fighters 2, players will be able to choose from a pool of Kirby\u2019s most iconic copy abilities as they fight to be the last Kirby standing. The now-deleted listing also mentioned new playable characters like Waddle Dee and King Dedede. \n\nThis is your Save State for Wednesday, September 23rd.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2QrheLBaLw", "date_published": "2020-09-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
