On Sept. 22, 2015, Ibeyi visited The Current for a live session hosted by Bill DeVille. Ibeyi comprise a mélange of cultures. Sisters Lisa-Kaindé Diaz and Naomi Diaz perform music with African and Cuban influences. They take their name "Ibeyi" from a Yoruba word meaning "twins." They sing English lyrics with vocal stylings reminiscent of American or British soul music. And when they chat with one another, they do so in French, the natural language of Paris, the city where they were raised and where they reside to this day. Watch one performance by Ibeyi from their 2015 session, plus two more from a 2018 episode of "Live From Here," recorded at the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Mama Says" (2015)
4:00 "Away Away" (2018)
7:14 "River" (2018)

PERSONNEL
Lisa-Kaindé Diaz – keys, vocals
Naomi Diaz – percussion, vocals
