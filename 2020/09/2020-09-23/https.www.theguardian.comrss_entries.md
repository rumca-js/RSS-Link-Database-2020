<p>A bumper crop means almonds are a bargain right now. Here’s how to make the most of them in pesto, marzipan, hotpots, macaroons … <br /></p><p>The flavour of an almond is particular, but subtle – almost bland. That’s not to say that almonds don’t make an important taste and textural contribution; not least on the side of a Magnum. Lightly toasted, they become an integral part of a simple pudding, such as Nigel Slater’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/19/nigel-slater-recipes-cherry-almond-tart-and-strawberry-granola-parfait)">strawberry granola parfait</a>.</p><p>Almonds are also processed into versions of common staples, including milk and flour, although they are too expensive to be everyday replacements – by weight, almond flour costs six times as much as wheat flour. At the moment, however, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/78c677a0-5209-4e63-a20e-d0bfd97e7366">almonds are undergoing a bit of a price collapse</a>, thanks to coronavirus and trade restrictions coinciding with a bumper US crop (about 80% of the world’s almonds come from California). In a bid to take advantage of this window of opportunity, here are 17 delicious ways to make use of this autumn’s unusually affordable almonds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/23/nutty-but-nice-17-fantastic-almond-recipes-from-apricot-tarts-to-lamb-tagines">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Elizabethans to Hollywood vamps, Duran Duran to Spandau Ballet … how a teenage style cult became a 1980s pop phenomenon that speaks to today</p><p>In 1979, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/mick-jagger">Mick Jagger</a> turned up at the Blitz club in London, home to an extravagant new youth cult. You can see why his interest was piqued – stories had just reached the press of a shabby Covent Garden wine bar playing host to a crowd of art students, ex-punks and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/davidbowie">Bowie</a> obsessives, caked in makeup and dressed as Elizabethans, Hollywood vamps, pirates, priests and all points inbetween. But Jagger never got to see them first-hand.</p><p>The exact reason the club’s teenage host Steve Strange turned him away isn’t clear (two different versions of the story appear in Dylan Jones’s mammoth oral history of the Blitz, its patrons and their impact on popular culture; more are available online). But evidently the Rolling Stones’ frontman didn’t meet Strange’s criteria that only “creative-minded pioneers” should be admitted. Off into the night Jagger went, presumably wondering exactly how a 19-year-old, recently relocated to London from his native Caerphilly had suddenly ended up the arbiter of what was and wasn’t cool.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/23/sweet-dreams-by-dylan-jones-review-the-story-of-the-new-romantics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many UK campsites are extending their season beyond October, after Covid put paid to early summer holidays. Here are 10 great options</p><p>If you missed out on a UK family camping holiday this summer because the campsites you tried were booked, don’t despair. Campsite platform Pitchup.com and the British Holiday and Home Parks Association are reporting that campsites around the UK have gained permission from local authorities to stay open longer than usual to make up for opening later in the year due to the lockdown. So, if you act fast, your family can still get some time under canvas this October half-term.</p><p>It is little wonder so many people had difficulty booking a pitch this year. With foreign travel fraught with difficulties and the risk of quarantine on return, there was a well-documented boom in domestic tourism with camping at its forefront – further boosting what has been an increasingly popular choice of holiday in the UK for many years. Even with the relaxation of restrictions that allowed pop-up sites to extend their season, campsites filled up all over the country.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/sep/23/best-uk-sites-autumn-camping-holiday-season-extended">Continue reading...</a>

Lobby’s mum, Atinuke, had found him that morning, 26 April. The family had thought he was recovering from Covid-19, but they had been wrong. The paramedics had come, but there was nothing they could do, and now the family was waiting with Femi for Lobby to arrive from London, before they called the funeral home.
