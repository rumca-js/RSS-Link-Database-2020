They take their name \"Ibeyi\" from a Yoruba word meaning \"twins.\" They sing English lyrics with vocal stylings reminiscent of American or British soul music. And when they chat with one another, they do so in French, the natural language of Paris, the city where they were raised and where they reside to this day.
