## Debutant Matthew Wolff at head of pack going into final round of US Open

<ul><li>Californian, 21, hits 65 in Saturday’s third round</li><li>Bryson DeChambeau <a href="https://www.usopen.com/scoring.html">two shots back in second</a></li></ul><p>What do Matthew Wolff and Francis Ouimet have in common? Nothing yet, but that could be about to change at Winged Foot. The scale of Wolff’s potential achievement is borne out by history. Ouimet was the last player to win the US Open on his debut; 107 years ago. Freakishly, 1913 also marked the last time this major was held in September. It even concluded on the month’s 20th day.</p><p>The 21-year-old Wolff, doubtless inspired by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/aug/10/collin-morikawa-seizes-the-day-to-claim-us-pga-championship-victory?ref=hvper.com" title="">Collin Morikawa’s success</a> at last month’s US PGA Championship, will take a two-stroke lead at five under par into day four after a third round display that completely belied his inexperience. Wolff’s grip on this major was tightened on the final green, where he converted for a birdie. The leader’s wonderful second shot, from 207 yards, had finished within 10ft of the cup. Wolff signed for a 65. Not only is this his maiden US Open appearance, it is only his second in a major. Winged Foot is renowned as one of golf’s most brutal tests; Wolff has made it appear so blissfully straightforward. So far, that is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/19/debutant-matthew-wolff-at-head-of-pack-going-into-final-round-of-us-open">Continue reading...</a>

Firstly, an energy-efficient home is more comfortable, requiring less heating and cooling. It is more cost-effective to run, saving you money through reduced bills. Then there’s the environmental benefits.</p><p>By reducing energy imported from the grid and replacing this with locally generated solar energy, you can dramatically reduce household carbon emissions.

## Molly Goddard brightens London fashion week with exuberant tulle

<p>The designer who made her mark with Villanelle’s frothy dress in Killing Eve is bouncing back with fizzing explosions of colour</p><p><br />When the fashion industry shut down in March, designer Molly Goddard thought she “might never make another collection again”. With orders rapidly cancelled as stores closed their doors, Goddard recalls being “on the phone to my accountant every day”. As the first wave receded and the world opened up, she began designing a few “very pared back” pieces. “I was thinking I might make 10 simple white dresses, perhaps.”</p><p>Then, as her team became able to spend some time together in the studio, “more and more colour” crept in. In the end the collection is one of Goddard’s most exuberant to date, with traffic-light colours and fizzing explosions of tulle on almost every look.<br /><br />It is no accident that seven of the 31 outfits in Goddard’s new collection are pink frilly dresses. Pink smocked-tulle dresses are to Goddard’s brand what bouclé tweed jackets are to Chanel. They have given her an instantly recognisable signature look – and one which resonates with alpha women of the moment. Beyoncé wore a frothy, floor-length Molly Goddard dress, accessorised with a matching fuchsia headdress, in this summer’s visual album <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/31/black-is-king-review-beyonce-disney-plus-lion-king">Black is King</a>. Villanelle, the alpha assassin in Killing Eve, became an on-screen style icon when she wore an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/oct/17/killing-eve-six-looks-to-die-for-from-the-bbc-thriller">earlier, paler and shorter iteration</a> of the same dress in 2018.<br /><br />Goddard’s obsession with smocking and shirring is ingrained from the dresses her mother, an art teacher, made for the designer and her sister Alice when they were children. As a young unknown designer Goddard began working with tulle simply because smocking and gathering require large volumes of fabric, and nylon tulle is inexpensive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/19/molly-goddard-brightens-london-fashion-week-with-exuberant-tulle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The activist and political commentator on writing his new book about Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s antisemitism crisis and reading for escapism</p><p>Owen Jones was born in Sheffield and raised in Stockport. He describes himself as “a fourth-generation socialist” and worked as a trade union and parliamentary researcher before becoming an author, broadcaster and political columnist for the <em>Guardian</em>. His first book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/19/chavs-demonization-working-class-review">Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/19/chavs-demonization-working-class-review">,</a> was published in 2011 and followed in 2014 by <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/01/the-establishment-how-get-away-with-it-review-owen-jones">The Establishment: And How They Get Away With It</a></em>. His new book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/this-land-9780241470947.html">This Land: The Story of a Movement</a></em><em>, </em>is an insider’s account of the rise and fall of the Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party.</p><p><em><strong>This Land</strong></em><strong> is written from the point of view of </strong><strong>“an observer and a participant</strong><strong>”. Did you write it essentially as an attempt to make sense of the scale of Corbyn’s election defeat?<br /></strong>When I started, I didn’t really have an agenda other than I am a man of the left and I always write from that perspective. I wanted to avoid political fatalism and defeatism, the notion that any transformative agenda for Labour is inherently doomed to defeat. I don’t think that. I think it’s achievable, but that the only way you can continue with the project is by accepting the mistakes and learning from them. The point of the book is to defend the idea that leftwing politics is viable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/19/owen-jones-a-lot-of-people-in-the-parliamentary-labour-party-are-horrible">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artist <a href="https://annaleedavis.com/">Annalee Davis</a><em> </em>was walking in fields once used for sugarcane in her Barbados homeland when she spotted unfamiliar plants. “I was taught to see them as weeds but now I understand their value offering biodiversity to exhausted land and their historical use in bush medicine.” Davis started pressing and using specially mixed Victorian paint to draw these plants on old plantation ledger pages. Colonialism wiped out Barbados’s biodiversity in the 17th century by replacing local vegetation with the monoculture of intensively farmed fields of sugarcane, but wild plants are proliferating again. The series is now on show at <a href="https://haarlemartspace.co.uk/">Haarlem Artspace</a>, Derbyshire, until 11 October as part of re:rural. “I want to use the plants to learn to listen to the land in another way and acknowledge its trauma,” she says. </p><p><strong><br /></strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/sep/19/wild-plants-of-barbados-illustrated-on-plantation-ledgers-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

Snooping around a messy house about to become so neat that I refuse to believe anyone could so much as make a cup of tea and keep it that way is so appealing to viewers that there is a newcomer to the game.</p><p>Joanna Teplin and Clea Shearer are the founders of a company called <a href="https://www.thehomeedit.com/story/">The Home Edit</a>, and have taken their “professional organiser” skills to Netflix for <em>Get Organized with The Home Edit</em>, in which they go into famous people’s houses, and some regular people’s houses, and organise them to within an inch of their lives. This most unassuming of series has stoked a debate so divisive it has the potential to split families down the middle. “Our intention is to give people the tools to make a system that’s smart, sustainable and also beautiful,” says Teplin, at the beginning of the series. And yet, they are advocates of the rainbow bookshelf.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/why-the-home-edit-shouldnt-judge-a-book-by-its-cover">Continue reading...</a>

## I'd had enough of Zoom – until I took a homemade sushi class

<p>At last, I have acquired a lockdown skill. Now I just need to work on the presentation<br /></p><p>In 1994, or thereabouts, I was working the kind of hours that meant lunch was always eaten at my desk – and thanks to this, it was a period in my life that was very miserable. In the post-industrial wasteland around our office, there were no decent sandwich shops; the age of avocado on sourdough was still far in the future. But then, one day, the world turned on its axis. On this particular morning, the chief subeditor returned to her page proofs smugly bearing a bag from somewhere called Pret a Manger, out of which she produced a slim plastic box whose contents she proceeded to eat with small wooden chopsticks. The rest of us were agog. The dinky bottle of soy sauce! The little slices of pickled ginger! We were wasabi green with envy.</p><p>Fifteen years later, and everything has changed. Thanks to the pandemic, offices everywhere are eerily empty, and the once near-ubiquitous Pret a Manger is embarking on a drastic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/04/pret-offers-monthly-subscription-to-boost-post-covid-pandemic-sales" title="">programme of retrenchment</a>. Meanwhile, sushi is no longer even remotely exotic; there are certain children of my acquaintance who regard a (clammy, tasteless) supermarket California roll as only a slightly more unusual treat than they do a bag of Monster Munch. Most unlikely of all from my point of view, I’ve recently learned to make my own sushi – something of which I am, as I write, embarrassingly proud. (I know this because when I put pictures of my first efforts on WhatsApp, my dear but plain-speaking friend, A, responded with a prawn emoji and … a string of expletives.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/19/had-enough-of-zoom-until-homemade-sushi-class-lockdown-skill-rachel-cooke">Continue reading...</a>

## Tim Garland: Refocus review – a classic 60s fusion revisited

<p>(Edition)<br />The saxophonist takes Stan Getz’s unique collaboration with Eddie Sauter in a bold new direction</p><p><em>Focus</em> was a 1961 album by Stan Getz, wildly adventurous at the time, in which Getz improvised tenor saxophone solos to music composed by Eddie Sauter, played by a small string orchestra. It’s widely regarded as a Getz masterpiece and a classic in its own right. Now <a href="http://www.timgarland.com/">Tim Garland</a> has come up with “a reworking for our time”. Except for the first track, which is taken from part of it note-for-note, <em><a href="https://editionrecords.com/tim-garlands-refocus-a-listening-guide/">Re</a></em><em><a href="https://editionrecords.com/tim-garlands-refocus-a-listening-guide/">focus</a></em> has little obvious connection with the original. But they do share one thing: neither is merely saxophone with string accompaniment. Sauter created seven complete compositions, leaving space for Getz to thread his melodic line through each one. In this case, Garland wrote his own compositions, but left two years before recording the solo part, so he came to it fresh. </p><p>Stylistically, Tim Garland is half a century away from Getz, in his composition as well as his playing. The whole soundscape is heavier and sometimes darker, especially in pieces such as Dream State and Night Flight, while the saxophone ascends to stratospheric heights rarely attempted in the early 60s. Where <em>Focus</em> was charming, <em>Re</em><em>focus</em> is challenging and definitely of our time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/19/tim-garland-refocus-review-stan-getz-eddie-sauter-focus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Daring colour mixes, striking furniture and footwear as decoration are the hallmarks of this townhouse in the 20th arrondissement</p><p>There’s something childish in the way I use colour,” says Gherardo Felloni, creative director of <a href="https://www.rogervivier.com/gb-en/home/" title="">Roger Vivier</a>. “In the last 20 years, designers went for beige or grey – safe colours. I am completely the opposite. I am spontaneous, and not afraid.”</p><p>Step into his three-storey townhouse in the magical Campagne à Paris, a village of cobbled streets and Narnia lampposts in the 20th arrondissement to the east of the city centre, and daring mixes await. A painting of deep and luminous blues hangs in the more formal of two sitting rooms, a pair of 1960s tubular glass sconces originally from the palatial waiting room of the monumental Milan Centrale railway station either side of it. “They are massive, and quite special,” says Felloni, whose comparatively modest home was built as part of a development of 92 houses in the 1920s for working-class families.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/19/heart-and-sole-a-shoe-designers-paris-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The middle-aged dads have to save the universe and their marriages in a shambolic but big-hearted sequel </p><p>Few 80s cultural artefacts have accrued the same level of enduring audience goodwill as the time-travelling adventures of the sweet-natured California rockers Bill S Preston Esq and Ted “Theodore” Logan. And it’s fair to say that this goodwill is required to do a fair amount of heavy lifting with this endearing but shambolic sequel.</p><p>The film rejoins Bill (Alex Winter) and Ted (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/18/keanu-reeves-grief-loss--bill-ted-john-wick-actor-tragedy">Keanu Reeves</a>) as middle-aged dads who aren’t so much has-beens as never-beens. Tasked with writing the song that will save civilisation, they have so far failed, and are reduced to prog rock noodling on theramins and bagpipes. And now the stakes are raised. Another, somewhat exasperated visitor from the future (Kristen Schaal) arrives to urge the pair to get their act together or not only will reality itself cease to exist, their marriages will crumble. Faced with this heinous turn of events, Bill and Ted do what they always do – tool around time in a souped-up phone box, occasionally stumbling upon answers. Meanwhile, their daughters are zipping through history in order to assemble the ultimate supergroup (Mozart, Hendrix, Louis Armstrong), an excess of talent given the godawful <em>Hooked </em><em>on Classics</em>-style abomination they end up playing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/19/bill-ted-face-the-music-review-keanu-reeves-alex-winter">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>St Luke’s Bombed Out Church, Liverpool theatre festival</strong></p><p>Prejudice and passion powers Maria Paul’s oral history of three white women who married black men in Liverpool 8</p><p>Performers are the public face of the arts’ response to coronavirus but, behind the scenes, producers and theatre-owners around the country are working flat out to keep theatre live and alive.

The setting seems symbolic: “the bombed out church”, hit in the blitz in 1941, is a reminder both of bad times and of people’s capacity to come through them.</p><p>Twelve shows are presented. The one I catch, <em>Sweet Mother</em>, is part of an ongoing oral-history project initiated by Maria Paul of Nwoko Arts. Paul recorded the stories of white women who had married black men and brought up families in Liverpool 8. From these, she developed a script that follows the lives of Josie, Vera and Joan from the second world war up until the Toxteth riots of 1981. Their tales unfurl partly via recordings of their voices, crackling over loudspeakers, but mostly via three actors who speak the women’s words, groove their dance moves, cry their sorrows and strut their triumphs, as they meet tough times with verve, wit and humour, holding their heads high in the face of hardship and racial prejudice (Amanda George-Higgins, Margaret Connell and Lisa McMahon, respectively, do their subjects justice).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/19/sweet-mother-review-sorrow-joy-and-self-reliance-in-toxteth">Continue reading...</a>

## How do you remake a classic like Utopia? With big budgets – and John Cusack

<p>The cult conspiracy drama is given a flashy US revamp, starring Cusack as a cult-of-personality CEO</p><p>A delicious little pleasure of mine is when a TV show kills off an interesting character within minutes of introducing them. A squalid little treat for the pig boy. I mean, think about it: how many shows go entire five-season runs without introducing a single interesting character? Interesting characters on TV are rare and difficult and should be clutched closely like jewels. And then Utopia turns up, and … sorry, did they just shoot that person in the <em>head</em>?</p><p>That jangling feeling of deja vu you have is correct: Utopia (Amazon Prime Video, Friday), is a glossy new remake of … <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/30/utopia-box-set-review">Utopia</a>, the Channel 4 dark comedy in the shape of a conspiracy thriller, only this time headed up by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/gone-girl-review-david-fincher-pike-affleck">Gone Girl</a>’s Gillian Flynn. As with every US interpretation of UK original material, it replaces the stuff we do well – a certain texture, a certain subtlety, dialogue that doesn’t end in someone shouting: “YOU JUST DON’T GET IT, DO YOU?” – and replaces it with what they are good at, which is sheen and John Cusack. This has done that, exactly. The original was dark and uncomfortable, a woozily ambitious series that was gone too soon. The new one isn’t really any of that but it does look really good, it’s still gleefully violent, and the story is still intricate like a clock is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/19/amazon-prime-video-utopia-john-cusack">Continue reading...</a>

He grabbed my hand in his giant paw, barked, “I’ll get you a job at the Telegraph. Good salary, too” and named a figure I just about – at 42 – earn now. He smiled, less like a boss offering employment, more like a king bestowing a blessing. A few years later, he was convicted of fraud. </p><p>The 90s was a golden era for alpha power players, and back then they seemed golden, as if they themselves were plated, though that may have been the glint from the riches surrounding them.

This is what happens when the finger of blame is pointed at you </p><p>Early on the morning of 14 August 2005, Alan Irwin, then 44, was with his partner, Donna, and their two young children in an apartment in Larnaca, Cyprus. It was a convenient base, only minutes from the airport. Irwin was an aircraft engineer; he had become obsessed with the technical aspects of planes as a young man in the Royal Air Force, following in the footsteps of his father, also an aircraft engineer and pilot. “I enjoy being around machines,” Irwin says. “If they’re broken, they’re broken. You can’t get angry at them. People can be quite frustrating.”</p><p>Irwin went on to work for airlines such as McAlpine Aviation and Monarch, and by 2005 had been a freelance licensed engineer for 15 years. The work suited him: it was well paid, and he liked to travel. He had worked in Kuwait, China, Malaysia, the Middle East, Africa, Mexico, Miami.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/19/in-2005-helios-flight-522-crashed-into-a-greek-hillside-was-it-because-one-man-forgot-to-flip-a-switch">Continue reading...</a>

Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a supreme court justice and singularly influential legal mind, was appointed by Bill Clinton in 1993, the court’s second-ever female justice, and served for nearly 30 years. She passed away due to complications from cancer<strong> </strong>on Friday. She was 87.</p><p>Strategic, contemplative and disciplined, but with a passion for the feminist cause that is rarely admitted into the halls of power, Ginsburg established an impressive legal legacy long before she became a judge. Over the course of a two-decade career as a lawyer before her appointment to the DC circuit court of appeals, she successfully argued cases that expanded civil rights law and 14th amendment protections to women, undoing a dense network of laws that had codified sex discrimination in all areas of American life. After she was elevated to the nation’s highest court, she found her own views moving left as the institution was pushed to the right. Her career was defined by courageous dissents that stood up for the principle of equal justice and kept alive the promise of a more free and fair America.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/ruth-bader-ginsburg-death-legacy-supreme-court">Continue reading...</a>
