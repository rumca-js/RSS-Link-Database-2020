Before August 24

Encouraged testing for all those who were exposed.

August 24 to September 18

People who do not have symptoms may not need to get tested

Now

Encouraged testing for all those who were exposed.

Clarifications made on September 18, 2020

Due to the significance of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, this guidance further reinforces the need to test asymptomatic persons, including close contacts of a person with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cases

Italy

Walter Ricciardi, (Ministry of Health’s scientific expert)

Distancing, masks, and controlling clusters are key

Use of Italy’s contact tracing app ‘Immuni’

Encouraging flu vaccines

Kept its quarantine at 14 days, refusing to shorten it to 7 or 10

Andrea Crisanti, (Molecular parasitologist, University of Padua)

Using its testing capacity wisely

Every time we get a positive case, even asymptomatic
we test everybody who is part of the family, social and work networks of that person

This is how all our clusters are now being handled   

rapidly pinpointing new positives, intercepting new outbreaks by isolating all the closest contacts

Italy did encourage foreign tourists

Clamped down on the party scene, prohibiting dancing in nightclubs August 17

Widespread civic adhesion to mask-wearing

Reality TV, hospital, morgues

but

Schools just starting

More going back to work

Equilibrium

WHO

Global factors, warming world, intensified human activity shrinking wild places

Likelihood of spill over of a novel pathogen from animals to human

We know for certain there will be more novel viruses

Another so called disease X

Keeping windows and door open, do it all

Surgeon General, Jerome M. Adams

February 29th, you may be increasing your chances of getting a disease by wearing that mask

Dr. Ashish Jha (Dean, Brown University School of Public Health
Hundred, hundred and fifty thousand of the deaths, may be more could have been prevented. We just didn’t take it seriously, we didn’t do it right.

Moderna / NIH, 20m vaccines by the end of the year

Seeking emergency authorisation for high-risk groups if it proves 70% effective

Covid-19: Do many people have pre-existing immunity?

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563.full

Studies that have documented SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells

20% to 50% of people with no known exposure to the virus

US, Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, UK, Sweden

Alessandro Sette, (immunologist, La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California)

At this point there are a number of studies that are seeing this reactivity in different continents, different labs.
 
As a scientist you know that is a hallmark of something that has a very strong footing

Common cold viruses, animal coronaviruses

Possible overall reduced population susceptibility

New York, London, and Stockholm

Have not reverted to the old curve with lockdown restrictions

Ongoing distancing measures

Memory T cells

Sweden, Family members of patients with confirmed covid-19

T cell responses found in those who were seronegative or asymptomatic

While around 60% of family members produced antibodies

90% had T cell responses

T cells were found in SARS patients 17 years after infection

Swine flu, H1N1

Pre-existing reactive T cells had clinically milder disease 

Required prospective studies

Mapping pre-existing reactivity to clinical outcomes

Not being done in the placebo arm of the vaccine studies
