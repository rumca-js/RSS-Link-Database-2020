Nothing yet, but that could be about to change at Winged Foot. The scale of Wolff\u2019s potential achievement is borne out by history. Ouimet was the last player to win the US Open on his debut; 107 years ago. Freakishly, 1913 also marked the last time this major was held in September.

Wolff signed for a 65. Not only is this his maiden US Open appearance, it is only his second in a major. Winged Foot is renowned as one of golf\u2019s most brutal tests; Wolff has made it appear so blissfully straightforward.

She passed away due to complications from cancer<strong> </strong>on Friday. She was 87.</p><p>Strategic, contemplative and disciplined, but with a passion for the feminist cause that is rarely admitted into the halls of power, Ginsburg established an impressive legal legacy long before she became a judge. Over the course of a two-decade career as a lawyer before her appointment to the DC circuit court of appeals, she successfully argued cases that expanded civil rights law and 14th amendment protections to women, undoing a dense network of laws that had codified sex discrimination in all areas of American life. After she was elevated to the nation\u2019s highest court, she found her own views moving left as the institution was pushed to the right. Her career was defined by courageous dissents that stood up for the principle of equal justice and kept alive the promise of a more free and fair America.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/ruth-bader-ginsburg-death-legacy-supreme-court\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/18/ruth-bader-ginsburg-death-legacy-supreme-court", "date_published": "2020-09-19 00:31:59+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Supreme court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \u2013 a life in pictures", "description": "<p>The supreme court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has died of metastatic pancreatic cancer.
