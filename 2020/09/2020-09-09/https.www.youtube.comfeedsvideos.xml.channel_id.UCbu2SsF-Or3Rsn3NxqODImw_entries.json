GameSpot also had some hands-on time with the multiplayer, so Persia goes into detail about new game modes like Combined Arms and VIP Escort and a new map called Armada. Beta access will be releasing on various weekends based on your platform starting in October. \n\nPersia also talks about the release date and price of the Xbox Series X finally being confirmed by Microsoft. At $499, the Xbox Series X can be yours as soon as November 10, and pre-orders open on September 22. Both the Series X and S are going to be a part of the Xbox All Access program, which lets you pay off the consoles over time and will also include other services like Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Live Gold, and more.\n\nLastly, Persia talks about another release date being announced. Ubisoft confirmed that Watch Dogs: Legion will be releasing on October 29 on current-gen consoles and PC and on November 10 on the Xbox Series X and S when the consoles launch. There is going to be another Ubisoft Forward tomorrow at 12pm Pacific, and we'll be covering all of it on GameSpot.com.\n\nThis is your Save State for Wednesday September 9th.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:16 - Black Ops Cold War Multiplayer Revealed\n01:11 - Xbox Series X Date & Price Confirmed\n02:01 - Watch Dogs Legion Gets A Date Too\n02:48 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AS6nyGfuEsU", "date_published": "2020-09-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Black Ops Cold War's Mini Ground War Mode: Combined Arms Gameplay", "description": "On September 9th, Activision held a Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War multiplayer preview event showing off the all-new Combined Arms mode. We were invited to a hands-on preview and were able to try it out! In this match, we play on the map \"Armada\"- a large daytime map with a fleet of ships. \n\nThe new mode plays much like 2019's Modern Warfare's Ground War mode. Although the player count is smaller (12v12) the objective is the same- capture and hold down 5 points across the map. The first team to 400 points wins. The Armada map is one of the larger maps utilized for the Combined Arms game mode. It features zip lines, gunboats, and jet skis to get from ship to ship to reach the capture points. \n\nActivision also revealed weapon loadouts, perks, maps, and more. After his hands-on time with the game, we asked Michael Higham his thoughts on the gameplay, and whether or not it'll live up to Warzone. Be sure to check out our video to hear his thoughts.

In this video we also take a look at Create-a-Class including loadouts, some of the better weapons you can start with, useful perks, and the standard fare of scorestreaks.

It will have a battle pass system as well as free post-launch content such as maps, modes, and in-game events.

One of the new modes included in our preview was \"VIP Escort\". In this game mode, you either play as a team escorting a VIP, or the opposing team whose mission is to eliminate the VIP. The VIP is a randomly selected playable character, and is controlled either by you or someone on your team.\n\nWhen you play as the VIP, your only weapon is a handgun, so relying on your team mates to get you to the exfil point is key. In our first match on the \"Miami\" map, we take control of the VIP and are escorted safely by our team. Our second and third matches take place in a large snow map called \"Crossroads\". Despite an attack of the middle of the map, our team eliminates the VIP just as he's preparing to leave. In our third match, our mission is to again eliminate the enemy VIP. In an awesome last-minute play, the VIP is sniped just before he's able to escape! \n\nGot questions about Cold War's multiplayer experience? Be on the lookout for our upcoming video where our very own Michael Higham answers questions based on his experience with his playtime.
