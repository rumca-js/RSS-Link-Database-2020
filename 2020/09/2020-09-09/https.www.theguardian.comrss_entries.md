<p>‘Saint Louis is on the frontline of the climate crisis. Entire rooms in people’s homes are underwater. In a few years, the sea defence this boy is striding along will be engulfed’</p><p>This was taken in Senegal near the end of 2018. I was gearing up for a project in neighbouring Mauritania for Reuters, but I wanted to understand the region better before I dived in. I had spent a few years based in west Africa. Where Mauritania can be quite closed off to outsiders and suspicious of photographers, Senegal is much more open. I’d met a lot of people in the Senegalese diaspora in the US, where I grew up, and I’d heard a lot about Saint Louis in the north. It was the capital before Dakar took on that role, and it’s a fascinating testament to the country’s colonial past.</p><p>Unlike many colonial projects elsewhere on the continent, the French didn’t attempt to completely repress who the Senegalese were as a people, and the city bears the marks of its complicated history. Much of the old town’s architecture is very French. Lots of mixed race people born of relationships between local women and French soldiers also live in Saint Louis. I was captivated by its history and its present.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/09/the-city-being-swept-out-to-sea-nicky-quamina-woos-best-photograph-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

He thought about his platform – as a Premier League and England footballer, with <a href="https://twitter.com/MarcusRashford">3 million Twitter followers</a>.</p><p>He probably thought about the backlash. History suggests sports stars put their heads above the parapet on social issues at their peril. But even if politicians are callous enough to oppose meals for children whose families are struggling, who would risk doing so publicly? Didn’t the Conservative party say time and time again that the nasty party days of “Margaret Thatcher, milk snatcher” were behind it?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/09/racist-responses-to-marcus-rashfords-campaign-for-children-are-no-surprise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Making the most of space created a sanctuary, meant we could leave the parks and shorelines to those who needed it during lockdown – and even saved me money on lettuces<br /></p><p>I was sent home just before the official start of lockdown, and then put on furlough from mid-April to mid-July. In my job at an art gallery in Liverpool I meet hundreds of people every day, so suddenly being at home all day, every day, was a huge change. I found it very upsetting at first. But as time went on I rediscovered how much I love where I live. It’s a small terrace house with a small back yard in Wavertree – my partner, Ann,<strong> </strong>and I call it the “Yarden” – and while I’ve always worked to make it look good and have colourful planting out there, this spring it became my haven.</p><p>I’ve had loads more time to take cuttings and grow stuff from seed. I planted food – lettuce, spinach, basil – and loads and loads of flowers. The flowers are the thing that has given me the most pleasure; photographing them, watching insects land on them, listening to birdsong and being able to be out there at a time I would normally be at work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/09/why-transforming-my-scrappy-backyard-into-a-yarden-has-been-life-changing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From shopping and holiday indecision to knowing how to time a joke, a good life filter can take many different forms</p><p>We’ve all been there: a night off to ourselves, a sofa, a streaming service and what do we do? We scroll, click and scroll some more until it’s time for bed. We’re bombarded by endless choice and outside noise – whether it’s social media posts demanding our attention or oat v almond v soya milk. Sometimes all we need is a way to stop and sift. Instead of #nofilter, what we actually need is #yesfilter. So here are four people who’ve discovered when their own filters can make all the difference: from the punning comedian who gets himself into sticky situations to the online dater who knew what her filter was but couldn’t apply it to her own life.</p><p>‘<strong>My filter made me realise that I no longer needed fast fashion’<br /></strong><em><strong>Rhona Mercer, editor, London<br /></strong></em>Most of my friends would describe their pre-kids lives as being a series of trips to the pub and meals at edgy restaurants. I, however, spent most of my 20s in a queue at the post office sending back my online shopping returns. And, if the post office was shut, I was on my iPad scouring the internet for clothes I would almost certainly never wear. I’m not saying I had a problem but I became so close to Dave in the post room at work that he almost got an invite to my wedding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/yes-filter/2020/sep/09/why-not-buy-one-nice-coat-instead-of-20-cheap-ones-four-times-a-filter-has-saved-the-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Baked apples are your starting point as the autumn evenings close in, but there are many more delicious ways of using the fruit, including savoury and salad dishes, and an unusual cocktail</p><p>The British apple season is a long one – spanning the earliest and latest ripening varieties, it runs from August to November – so there is no need to panic or speak of gluts. Stored under optimal conditions, apples also last a really long time, which is why we’re never without them. For the grower, apple season is a thing – for the rest of us, not so much.</p><p>But there’s nothing like year-round plenty to induce a failure of imagination, a failure that often starts at the supermarket. I’ll just buy apples, you think. I can always pile them in a bowl until inspiration strikes.

In July 2019 he was sitting in his muggy office, looking forward to a holiday, when his chief of staff appeared at the doorway. “We’ve got a problem. There’s been a leak,” she said.</p><p>The Mail on Sunday had got hold of confidential diplomatic cables written by Darroch for Theresa May’s government.

<p>With the spectre of deflation looming in the wake of Covid-19, radical new policies could revolutionise the world economy<br /></p><p>Are we seeing the end of the supremacy of the US dollar? With soaring government spending and gaping deficits are we on the cusp of a great surge of inflation? In light of the extreme financial measures required by the Covid-19 crisis and the alarming polarisation of US politics, the markets can be forgiven for asking such dramatic questions.</p><p>But it is worth reminding ourselves that as recently as March, the whole world was crying out for dollars. And far from fearing inflation, the problem actually facing central banks is how to avoid sliding into deflation. Falling prices are a disaster because they squeeze debtors – think <a href="https://www.moneysupermarket.com/money-made-easy/what-is-negative-equity/">negative equity</a> in housing markets – and create a vicious circle of postponed purchases, leading to falling demand and further deflation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/09/central-banks-deflation-covid-19-world-economy">Continue reading...</a>

His controversial 2004 essay, <a href="https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/too-diverse-david-goodhart-multiculturalism-britain-immigration-globalisation">“Too Diverse?”</a>, which challenged liberal orthodoxies surrounding immigration, appeared heterodox (not to mention menacing) to many of his readers and associates, but foreshadowed a decade in which anti-immigration sentiments and Nigel Farage moved steadily towards the mainstream of British politics.</p><p>His 2017 book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/mar/22/the-road-to-somewhere-david-goodhart-populist-revolt-future-politics">The Road to Somewhere</a></em>, which coined the catchy binary of liberal “anywheres” and traditionalist “somewheres”, captured Theresa May’s stated ideological project of a new working-class conservatism, later discernible in Boris Johnson’s 2019 election triumph. And now, <em>Head Hand Heart</em> arrives to throw doubt on the shibboleths of the “knowledge-based” economy and the importance of graduates in society, just as the government has made clear it wants fewer people going to university, and as Covid-19 threatens a major financial crisis for higher education.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/09/head-hand-heart-by-david-goodhart-review-does-getting-a-degree-matter-too-much">Continue reading...</a>

The substantial and largely avoidable death toll in the current epidemic is undoubtedly due to a series of ill-informed and inept decisions about how the country should respond to its greatest public health crisis in more than a century. But the virus’s task was undoubtedly made easier by a serious deterioration in the health of the population over the past decade.</p><p>Since the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century life expectancy in England has <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/lifeexpectancies/articles/howhaslifeexpectancychangedovertime/2015-09-09">improved consistently</a>. <strong> </strong>Until the last decade that is.

In April Alastair Campbell <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-deaths-labour-criticise-government-starmer">noted</a> how political discussion was rarely “framed by things Labour has said or done”. In a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2020/aug/05/peter-mandelson-labour-europe-politics-weekly-podcast">recent interview</a> with the Guardian, Peter Mandelson urged Keir Starmer to “construct a project of his own”, something more than a “short-term political fix”. These are just two of the more prominent voices concerned that Starmer’s Labour has yet to outline, in Mandelson’s words, “how it would do things differently”.</p><p>The issue here is the question of vision. Starmer’s cautious competence has given him approval ratings higher than those of a particularly poor prime minister. But can Labour look further ahead than next week’s poll? If so, what does it think it sees?

No pressure, then, for the artist who is daubing the whole thing on a wall just off the main street in Kingsbury, the north London suburb where the singer grew up.</p><p>“I’m kind of underestimating how popular he was,” says Dawn Mellor, the 50-year-old artist who has taken on the task. Manchester-born and Derbyshire-raised, the painter is a warm, livewire presence, with piercing eyes and a closely shaved head. Mellor, who is non-binary and goes by the pronouns they/them, is on the second day of painting when we speak via Zoom. They have spent the day going up and down ladders, rain permitting, and the scale of the task, in every sense, is starting to become clear. “<em>Everybody</em> seems to love George Michael! Nobody’s got a bad word to say about him, which I didn’t realise beforehand.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/09/george-michael-mural-dawn-mellor-wham-tastic-smoke">Continue reading...</a>
