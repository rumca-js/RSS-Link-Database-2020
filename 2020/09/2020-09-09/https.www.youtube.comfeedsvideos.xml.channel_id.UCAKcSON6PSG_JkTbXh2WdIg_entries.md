On September 9, 2013, J. Roddy Walston and the Business performed for the first time in The Current studio. They visited our studio again almost exactly four years later — on Sept. 15, 2017 — with a stop in between to play at First Avenue for The Current's 10th Birthday Party on Jan. 24, 2015. Marking all that, here are a couple performances by J. Roddy Walston and the Business, recorded live in our studio. A great band, they amicably announced their dissolution at the end of 2019.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Blade of Truth" (2017)
3:51 "Marigold" (2013)
