The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Phoebe Bridgers chose the White House. OK, maybe it's a green screen, but she and her team created a sweet mock-up of the Oval Office, with Phoebe performing behind a very special desk. It's a far cry from the hotel bed in Austin we first filmed Phoebe on back in 2017, but her ambitions and talent run high. She played the Tiny Desk later that year and returned with newfound bandmates, Lucy Dacus and Julien Baker, as boygenius one year later. But there was more to come when she surprised us all for a magical collaboration with her musical hero Conor Oberst as Better Oblivion Community Center just six months later.

Phoebe and bandmates Marshall Vore on drums and Harrison Whitford on guitar perform three songs from her brilliant new album, Punisher. They open with "Kyoto," a story song based on her first trip to Japan, followed with a sweet version of "Moon Song" and the sad details of loving someone who doesn't love themself. And then comes the kicker, as Phoebe introduces herself with the words "I hope everybody's enjoying their apocalypse," as the band kicks into her surreal doomsday tune "I Know the End." And what an end it is: The trio expands to an ensemble and a crowd-sourced chorus of fans — recording from bedrooms, cars, backyards and trampolines — lets out the kind of cathartic scream that has come to define 2020 for so many of us.

Phoebe for President, 2020.

Maia Stern | September 9, 2020
For his Tiny Desk (home) concert, Bill Callahan stands outside his home, near a desk adorned with a taller-than-usual globe, two books and a single banana. Joined by trumpet player Derek Phelps and guitarist Matt Kinsey, the trio performs "Released" from 2019's Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest and three songs from Gold Record, which came out just last week. Callahan has a deep pocket of stories to tell, whether his own or those of other characters. Either way, we are all ears.

I keep coming back to a lyric from "Another Song," which he performs here: "Lonesome in a pleasant way." We're all a little bit more lonesome than usual right now, but we're lonesome together. Maybe that feels OK, pleasant even.

Callahan, in the zone during this performance, shares so few words between songs that we decided to follow up and ask what he's been feeling about his world today.

"There are a lot of voices these days. So many that, I think, even positive sentiments become detrimental in their deafening number," Callahan explains. "Quiet reflection can be the clearest and most informative and soothing voice you'll ever hear. There are many unknowns at this time in history. It's more than a junction in our old world. It's the possibility of a whole new world. A large part of me believes this. Listen to music, read books, talk to friends and family. Don't listen to the voices, not even mine!"

SET LIST
"Pigeons"
"Released"
"Another Song"
"The Mackenzies"
