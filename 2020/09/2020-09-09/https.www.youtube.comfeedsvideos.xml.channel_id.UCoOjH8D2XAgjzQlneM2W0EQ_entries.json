You guessed it - spies, gathering intel, espionage! And because information about our enemies, about the world around us is so vital to our basic survival - spying quickly emerged as humanity\u2019s oldest occupation. As Sun Tzu said, if you think about it, the only way to get ahead in life, to crush your enemies and take the throne, you\u2019re gonna need foreknowledge - intelligence! So the million-dollar question becomes how do you go about getting said intel from other men? Let\u2019s learn the art of spycraft\n\nSpycraft is one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented professions in the world. Espionage is all about collecting that juicy intel on our enemies. The first way to collect intel is Overtly through reading the newspapers, the press, and all the public information that comes out of an enemy\u2019s country. The clandestine intel collection, or espionage - the professional name for it, always has a place in this world\n\nThe \u201cessence\u201d of espionage is access. You choose the objective of what intel you want to know about your enemy. You need to get an agent or some device close enough to the target, to get access to the target, to gather the intel you need. Your agent then has to deliver the intel to you without it getting lost or intercepted enroute.\n\nThere are five different types of spies: Native spies, Internal spies, Double agent spies, Expendable spies, and living spies. These types of spies have their limits. This is where plants come in.\n\nPlanted agents are agents that are somehow able to penetrate the target and stay there for an extended period of time. The only way to have planted agents today is either by using illegals or by turning someone who\u2019s already on the inside. Your job is to simply learn a potential traitor's key pain points, and make them an offer they can\u2019t refuse.\n\nTo collect that intel, agents can place bugs, hidden cameras, take pictures with their phone, etc. Getting that intel back to their superiors is a different story.\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna subvert your enemies with spies, you can bet that they\u2019re gonna try to do the same to your nation with their own set of spies. This is where counterintelligence comes in where you basically just do the opposite of what you do to spy on other nations. Once you have an enemy spy under your control, start by having them report back real intel to their superiors.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
