Aerosol emission and superemission during human speech increase with voice loudness (Nature Scientific Reports)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-38808-z

Coughing and sneezing, visible droplets + small ones

Visible, 50 micrometres upwards

Normal speech, just the small ones

One micrometre, invisible

Carry a variety of communicable respiratory pathogens

Particle emission during normal human speech, positively correlated with the loudness (amplitude)

Quite, low amplitude = 1 to 50 particles per second

Loud, high amplitude = 10 to 500 particles per second

Regardless of the language spoken (English, Spanish, Mandarin, or Arabic)

Counting aloud from 1 to 100 releases at least 6 times as many particles as an individual cough

Singing, x 6 compared to normal speech

Speech superemitters

x 10

Small particles

Suspend in the air

Penetrate deeper

Applications

Normal speech 10 decibel range

Ambient noise in restaurants, 70 decibels

Quite zones in public spaces
