In this video, Persia talks about this morning's reveal of Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War multiplayer. GameSpot also had some hands-on time with the multiplayer, so Persia goes into detail about new game modes like Combined Arms and VIP Escort and a new map called Armada. Beta access will be releasing on various weekends based on your platform starting in October. 

Persia also talks about the release date and price of the Xbox Series X finally being confirmed by Microsoft. At $499, the Xbox Series X can be yours as soon as November 10, and pre-orders open on September 22. Both the Series X and S are going to be a part of the Xbox All Access program, which lets you pay off the consoles over time and will also include other services like Game Pass Ultimate, Xbox Live Gold, and more.

Lastly, Persia talks about another release date being announced. Ubisoft confirmed that Watch Dogs: Legion will be releasing on October 29 on current-gen consoles and PC and on November 10 on the Xbox Series X and S when the consoles launch. There is going to be another Ubisoft Forward tomorrow at 12pm Pacific, and we'll be covering all of it on GameSpot.com.

This is your Save State for Wednesday September 9th.

On September 9th, Activision held a Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War multiplayer preview event showing off the all-new Combined Arms mode. We were invited to a hands-on preview and were able to try it out! In this match, we play on the map "Armada"- a large daytime map with a fleet of ships. 

The new mode plays much like 2019's Modern Warfare's Ground War mode. Although the player count is smaller (12v12) the objective is the same- capture and hold down 5 points across the map. The first team to 400 points wins. The Armada map is one of the larger maps utilized for the Combined Arms game mode. It features zip lines, gunboats, and jet skis to get from ship to ship to reach the capture points. 

Activision also revealed weapon loadouts, perks, maps, and more. After his hands-on time with the game, we asked Michael Higham his thoughts on the gameplay, and whether or not it'll live up to Warzone. Be sure to check out our video to hear his thoughts. Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War comes to PS4, Xbox One and PC on November 13th.

## 7 Games That Were Something Else Entirely

Games are hard to make and don't always get released with their original vision intact. From Assassin's Creed to Donkey Kong, here are 7 games that you might not know used to be something else entirely.

00:00 Intro
00:21 Assassin's Creed was Prince of Persia
01:38 Halo was an RTS
02:35 Devil May Cry was originally Resident Evil 4
03:18 Donkey Kong was Popeye
03:58 Splinter Cell was pitched as a Bond game
04:54 Borderlands' original art style was very... anti-Borderlands
05:32 The original plans for BioShock were wild 

BioShock originally began life as a very ambitious game about a cult deprogrammer, with an asymmetrical multiplayer mode that would see you play as a monster in another player's story mode. Assassin's Creed was originally a follow up to Prince of Persia: The Sands Of Time, and its name used to be Prince of Persia: Assassins, before the Prince was dropped completely. 

There are countless more examples, and the video above explores 7 games that were something else entirely.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, developed by Treyarch in partnership with Raven Software, is this year's entry into the wildly popular annual shooter franchise. In this video we look at how it two can exist alongside the robust Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Cold War’s multiplayer includes the larger 12 v 12 Combined Arms mode, which features the Armada map with ziplines and ship to ship combat as well as a tense 6 v 6 VIP Escort mode that's more reminiscent of Counter-Strike. In this video we also take a look at Create-a-Class including loadouts, some of the better weapons you can start with, useful perks, and the standard fare of scorestreaks. Some of the maps are unique such as one set in 1980’s Miami, a snow map called Crossroads, and the aforementioned Armada map completely set in the ocean. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is confirmed to be a cross-gen and cross-play title. It will have a battle pass system as well as free post-launch content such as maps, modes, and in-game events. Progression from multiplayer will feed into Warzone including new items to be used in both games. Cold War is out November 13th for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC with later releases on next-gen consoles PS5 and Xbox Series X.

We got our hands on Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War's multiplayer! One of the new modes included in our preview was "VIP Escort". In this game mode, you either play as a team escorting a VIP, or the opposing team whose mission is to eliminate the VIP. The VIP is a randomly selected playable character, and is controlled either by you or someone on your team.

When you play as the VIP, your only weapon is a handgun, so relying on your team mates to get you to the exfil point is key. In our first match on the "Miami" map, we take control of the VIP and are escorted safely by our team. Our second and third matches take place in a large snow map called "Crossroads". Despite an attack of the middle of the map, our team eliminates the VIP just as he's preparing to leave. In our third match, our mission is to again eliminate the enemy VIP. In an awesome last-minute play, the VIP is sniped just before he's able to escape! 

Got questions about Cold War's multiplayer experience? Be on the lookout for our upcoming video where our very own Michael Higham answers questions based on his experience with his playtime. Everything from guns used, map design, perks and more.
