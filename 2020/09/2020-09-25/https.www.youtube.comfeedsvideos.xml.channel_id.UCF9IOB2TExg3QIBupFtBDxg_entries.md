First

Prevent amplifying events 

Second

Protect the vulnerable 

Third

Educate, empower, enable communities

To protect themselves and others

Using every tool at their disposal 

Fourth

Get the basics right

Find, isolate, test and care for cases

Trace and quarantine their contacts

Also

Effective vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics will also be vital

Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator

Low- and middle-income countries

Deployment of tools to rapidly reduce the risk of severe COVID-19 disease globally

By the end of next year, ACT Accelerator aims to:

Deliver 2 billion doses of vaccine

245 million courses of treatment

500 million diagnostic tests to 

Evaluating more than 50 tests

Rapid and accurate diagnostics, more news on that next week

Analysing more than 1,700 clinical trials

Secured courses of dexamethasone for up to 4.5 million patients in lower-income countries 

The only medicine shown to reduce the risk of death so far

COVAX

Supporting the development of 9 vaccines

67 high-income economies have formally joined

34 are expected to sign

92 lower-income countries who are eligible for support through

Financing gap ACT Accelerator, US$35 billion

Molecular Architecture of Early Dissemination and Massive Second Wave of the SARS-CoV-2 Virus in a Major Metropolitan Area (22nd September)

Virus has had plenty of chances

N = 5,085 

Houston, Texas

Ethnically diverse region of 7 million

Genomes recovered in the earliest recognized phase (January 2020) and currently

Virus originally introduced into Houston many times independently

Virtually all strains in the second wave have Gly614 (aspartate to Glycine)
amino acid replacement in the spike protein

Receptor binding domain of spike protein

Linked to increased transmission and infectivity

Significantly higher virus loads in the nasopharynx on initial diagnosis

Relationship between virus genotypes and altered virulence

Adherence to the test, trace and isolate system 
(National Institute for Health Research, Public Health England, King’s College London, University of East Anglia, 18th September)

Need for people with a persistent new onset cough, fever or loss of their sense of taste or smell to: 
Remain at home for at least seven days from the onset of their symptoms
Request an antigen test
Provide details of their close contacts to a dedicated service if the test result is positive
Close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 to remain at home for 14 days from the time of their contact
2 March to 5 August 2020 

N = 42,127

Identification of the key symptoms of COVID-19 (cough, high temperature / fever, and loss of sense of smell or taste)

48.9% of participants identified key symptoms of COVID-19

Self-reported adherence to self- isolation if symptomatic

18.2%

Requesting an antigen test if symptomatic

11.9%

Intention to share details of close contacts

76.1%

Self-reported adherence to quarantine if alerted that you had been in contact with a 
confirmed COVID-19 case 

10.9%

Non-adherence was associated with:

Men

Younger age groups

Having a dependent child in the household

Lower socio- economic grade

Greater hardship during the pandemic

Working in a key sector. 

Conclusions

Practical support and financial reimbursement is likely to improve adherence

Targeting messaging


Covid-19 sniffer dogs

Four dogs working at Helsinki airport

State-funded pilot scheme

If it works, it could prove a good screening method in other places 

After dog indicates infection, PCR testing is carried out

Nearly 100% accuracy, even days before symptoms

Dogs are also able to identify Covid-19 from a much smaller samples than PCR tests

Dogs can sniff 10-100 molecules to detect the presence of the virus
