With the iPhone 11 introducing more paired components than ever before, its time i tried to fix mine which has a badly cracked screen and faulty cameras. \nIf a manufacture is successfully able to completely lock down 3rd party repairs, what happens after they drop support for the product? Are we supposed to throw it away and buy a new one? I refuse to support that business model and will try anything to stop it from happening.\nI will be sticking with my current fruit phone, from Blackberry :)\n--------------------------------------Socials-------------------------------------\nWebsite: https://www.hughjeffreys.com \nInstagram: http://instagram.com/hughjeffreys\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hughjeffreys\n---------------------------------------Links---------------------------------------\nGet parts, tools, and thousands of free repair guides from iFixit at:\u00a0\n    https://iFixit.com/hughjeffreys\nAustralia Store: https://ifix.gd/2FPxhKy\n(DISCLAIMER: This description contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, l will receive a small commission.)", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhpnSgywen0", "date_published": "2020-09-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
