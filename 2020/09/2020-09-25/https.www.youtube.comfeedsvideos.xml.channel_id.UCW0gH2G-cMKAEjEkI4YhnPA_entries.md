After the bigger Hobbit Day video, we're taking a shorter look at a much smaller - and quicker - battle in the north of Middle-earth, The Battle of Greenfields.  The famous ancestor of Bilbo Baggins, Bullroarer Took was the hero of the only battle inside the Shire until the Battle of Bywater, in which Frodo, Sam, Merry, & Pippin are involved.
