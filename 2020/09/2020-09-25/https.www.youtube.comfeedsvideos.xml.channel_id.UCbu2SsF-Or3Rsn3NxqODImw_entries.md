Before the eventual release of Baldur's Gate 3, we thought it would be fun to go through the 1998 adventures of Gorion's Ward, Sarevok, Minsc, Volo and the rest of the gang from Baldur's Gate 1 + 2 as we recount the main stories of the base games, as well as the Siege of Dragonspear and Throne of Bhaal expansions.

With the October 6th release of Baldur's Gate 3 we are taking a look at the classic that started it all. The 1998 original Baldur's Gate, following the adventures of Imoen, Minsc and the rest of the companions that follow the player through Faerun, Baldur's Gate and the Sword Coast. 

Baldur's Gate 3 will be revisiting much of the same locations and meeting the same enemies as the original game, namely the world of Avernus, The Flaming Fist and the Mind Flayers.

While the story seems very much separate, there's still plenty of lore and world building that new players to the franchise can learn right here, and take with them in their adventures in Baldur's Gate 3.

We're back with another deep dive into the world and history of Cyberpunk 2077 in this installment of our video lore series exploring everything you'll want and need to know ahead of the release of CD Projekt Red's first-person RPG. This week's episode, we're delving into the street gangs that operate throughout Night City.

In the video above, Jean-Luc Seipke talks about the main gangs that you'll have to worry about in Cyberpunk 2077. There are over 50 gangs in Night City, but only 10 will pose a serious threat to you. Those 10 will be more than enough, though, with each controlling and operating in a different part of the city.

In Cyberpunk 2077, you'll contend with Maelstrom, the Animals, 6th Street, Valentinos, the Tyger Claws, The Mox, the Voodoo Boys, the Scavengers, the Aldecaldos, and the Wraiths. Like we said before, there are a whole lot more, but we'll save the remaining minor gangs for another video down the line.

Cyberpunk 2077 will be released for Xbox One, PS4, and PC on November 19. The game is coming to Google Stadia sometime this year as well, and both Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5 next-gen ports are in the works too.

## Demon's Souls PS5 Remake Vs. Original (Gameplay Comparison)

The PS5 Demon's Souls Remake shows a lengthy gameplay walkthrough of the Nexus tutorial, so we decided to see how the game looks compared to its 2009 original.

Demon's Souls was first released for the PlayStation 3 in 2009, and while it has become something of a cult classic, the Dark Souls franchise that followed it has had a massive impact on the gaming landscape ever since. So it's no surprise that the upcoming remake of Demon's Souls, bound for the PlayStation 5 later this year, is one of the most anticipated launch titles for the console.

With the original Demon's Souls being more than a decade old, there are a lot of possible improvements when bringing the game forward into the next generation. We fired up both the original Demon's Souls to compare it to the PS5 remake, and the results are pretty impressive. Check out the video above to see both games running side by side through cutscenes, combat, and the tutorial boss fight.

We've got plenty of coverage of the PS5 and the next generation of consoles and more coming as we approach their launch this holiday season, so stay tuned to GameSpot.

## Xbox Makes HUGE Moves | Generation Next

It's been an absolutely huge week for Xbox. Opening preorders up for Xbox Series X and Series S alone would have been a momentous occasion for the company, but ahead of doing that it dropped a bombshell: Xbox has acquired ZeniMax Media. The purchase includes Bethesda, and properties such as The Elder Scrolls, Fallout, Doom, Dishonored, and Wolfenstein, among others.

In this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor talk about the implications of Xbox's acquisition, what it means for PlayStation 5 exclusives that the company was working on, and the impact it could have on Game Pass. They also look at what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadela has said previously and discuss whether Xbox could make further acquisitions. 

Of course, the crew also cover Xbox's preorder process which, while not as disastrous as PlayStation's, still was much rougher than most people would have liked. Retailers struggled to meet demands and, in some cases, outright didn't make preorders for the Series X and S available at the time prescribed by Microsoft. Were Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor able to get one? Watch and find out. 

Generation Next is GameSpot's dedicated show that's all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. Each week we'll be digging deeper into the biggest news stories, as well as talking to the developers that are charting the future of gaming.
