<p>During the pandemic, the EU dropped its austerity-inducing budget rules and restrictions on its central bank’s ability to finance government spending. It get should rid of them permanently</p><p>In an emergency, the normal rules do not apply. Coronavirus has shown the EU can do things differently. Early on the commission <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-ministers-suspend-deficit-limits-to-fight-coronavirus-slump/" title="">dumped</a> its obsession with balancing the books. The prohibition on monetary financing of government debt by the European Central Bank (ECB) was <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/whats-the-ecb-doing-in-response-to-the-covid-19-crisis/" title="">dropped</a>. This allowed member states the freedom to mitigate the damage of a Covid recession without worrying too much about borrowing levels.</p><p>That fear was well-founded. The EU had used high debt levels as a reason to intervene in public policy. Emma Clancy, an economist for the leftwing block of MEPs, has <a href="https://emmaclancy.com/2020/02/17/discipline-and-punish-end-of-the-road-for-the-eus-stability-and-growth-pact/" title="">noted</a> the commission had used debt burdens to ask member states to cut spending on, or privatise, healthcare services 63 times between 2011 and 2018. In the EU there is often an Olympian disdain for critics of its fiscal and monetary rules. This is understandable. No one likes to be reminded of one’s own mistakes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/25/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-economy-adopt-not-outlaw-keynesian-policies">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Clare Grover and Gavin Gaskain decided to test out a Renault ZOE, it was love at first drive. Three years later, the couple tell Fiona Cowood how their EV has changed their lives</p><p>They may have had it for more than three years now, but Gavin and Clare are still as thrilled with their Renault ZOE – their first electric car – as they were when they drove it off the forecourt back in June 2017. “It’s just a really nice car,” says Clare. “Very quiet, really comfortable and I find it so easy to drive.”</p><p>Many are wary of switching to an EV (electric vehicle) because they’ve heard the initial outlay can be costly, but Gavin and Clare are proof that going electric needn’t dent your pocket. “The total cost upfront was zero,” says Gavin. “We split the cost over four years, with 0% interest from Renault.” Running costs have been a pleasant surprise too. Their old car, an ageing people carrier, was costing £400 a month on diesel. Add in the cost of repairs, and it was amounting to a small fortune. “The ZOE is much cheaper to run day-to-day,” says Gavin. “We’ve worked out it runs at about a penny per mile.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-power-of-firsts/2020/sep/25/our-first-electric-car-zoe-is-part-of-the-family-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>UK students are feeling anxious following Scottish ban on parties, campus lockdowns and a warning against travelling home for Christmas</p><p>As freshers week drew to a close at the Parker House hall of residence in Dundee last week, one flat invited 30 or so fellow students to a party. Unknown to any of the attendees, one was experiencing early symptoms of coronavirus. When that party-goer and their flatmates all tested positive for the virus, the whole flat locked down, followed by the entire block.</p><p>The outbreak has turned an initially pleasant freshers week of socially distanced fun into a nightmare for Duncan Rendall, a first-year student at Abertay University who is now in his fourth day of lockdown. “I can’t leave my flat at all so I’m just stuck in my room,” he says. “It’s very isolating.

Come January, we’ll triumphantly take back control of our borders – something Michael Gove has wholeheartedly embraced, announcing this week that truckers will need a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/23/truck-queues-could-be-7000-long-when-brexit-transition-ends-ministers-warn">Kent </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/23/truck-queues-could-be-7000-long-when-brexit-transition-ends-ministers-warn">access </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/23/truck-queues-could-be-7000-long-when-brexit-transition-ends-ministers-warn">permit</a>” to get into the county from 1 January. So, basically a passport, then.</p><p>The de-facto border has been posed as the answer to the predicted chaos, or in official parlance the “reasonable worst-case scenario”, when the UK departs from the single market next year – including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/14/official-post-brexit-report-warns-of-queues-of-7000-lorries-in-kent">queues of up to 7,000 lorries</a> in Kent. That’s around 100 miles of traffic, and two-day delays on both sides of the Channel – and not just for hauliers. Forget about jumping on the Eurostar and grabbing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/feb/12/best-restaurants-cafes-near-train-stations-paris-rome-berlin">lunch at Brasserie Bellanger</a> (pandemic permitting). According to a report drawn up by the border and protocol delivery group, passengers could also be forced to wait an extra two hours for Eurostar trains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/25/majority-kent-leave-uk-britain-brexit-border-england">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Six more months of pandemic in Boristime may mean at least one more year of dread in real time</p><p>There was a heartbreaking story in the Times on Saturday about how Boris Johnson was feeling overworked and underpaid. How the flat in No 10 was a bit small, how the rent from the home he shares with Carrie Symonds in Camberwell has to be offset against his income as prime minister and how he even has to pay for any food the No 10 kitchen sends upstairs. Now you might have thought that someone who appears to have spent his whole life believing that becoming prime minister was the fulfilment of his destiny would have spent rather more time investigating the financial implications of his decisions. After all if he had been looking for a cushy job to keep his still growing family in the style to which he aspired, Boris would have been better off remaining a backbench MP on £80,000, while raking in another £350,000 from the Daily Telegraph for the occasional column dashed off in an hour and who knows how much more for after-dinner speaking. But we all have our crosses to bear, so I suppose we should treat the prime minister falling on hard times on a salary of £150,000 as a personal tragedy. With that in mind, several members of a WhatsApp group of which I am a member began to wonder what we could do to help Boris at his time of crisis. Two ideas came to mind. The first was a telethon in which stars of stage and screen could do comedy turns in between sad black and white footage of Boris sleeping in a cardboard box in the No 10 attic. The second was to set up a JustGiving page for Boris. So far it has raised £5 of its hoped for £1m. That donation has come from a “Matt Hancock” with the message, “We send the EU 350m a week. Let’s Give it to Boris instead.” Feel free to contribute. Or not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/sep/25/digested-week-with-covid-and-winter-days-upon-us-im-trying-to-store-up-nice-memories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The town of Paradise tries to get back on its feet in Ron Howard’s quietly harrowing documentary<br /></p><p>As America’s west coast continues to burn, this Ron Howard-directed documentary tells of the aftermath of the 2018 wildfires in Paradise, California. At the time it was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California history. Paradise first entered the international consciousness via a Trumpian gaffe that seemed to encapsulate the administration’s casual indifference to climate change; <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2018/nov/19/pleasure-what-a-name-trump-confused-over-fire-hit-town-paradise-video">the president referred to the town as “Pleasure</a>” while touring the devastation. That clip is featured again here, this time utterly drained of even the bitterest humour by the harrowing images that precede it.<br /><br />Footage garnered from emergency response vehicle dashcams and survivors’ mobiles shows the now-familiar ash clouds, orange skies and deadlocked queues of fleeing traffic – no less shocking for that familiarity. In one remarkable shot, four horses gallop away from the inferno, as if having already abandoned the four horsemen in their haste to escape the apocalypse. The irony is stark: Paradise sure looks a lot like hell.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/rebuilding-paradise-review-after-the-wildfire-in-a-california-town">Continue reading...</a>

Only a few brief months ago, many intensive care units (ICUs) across Britain came close to being overwhelmed by patients with a novel coronavirus, unknown to medicine before January of this year, and causing potentially life-threatening lung disease in up to 20% of those it infects. With the relaxation of the lockdown, however – only possible because it had been so effective – and the good summer weather in which we have been encouraged by Westminster to eat, drink and be merry, we have begun to forget. We have rapidly forgotten the fear and anxiety that rightly held Britain in their grip throughout the spring of 2020, the 40,000 people who died from a single infectious disease within a few brief months and the incalculable suffering caused to their families. We have forgotten that more than 600 health and social care workers died as a result of their work caring for others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/25/inside-a-welsh-icu-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On Wednesday we learned that no one would be held accountable for the murder of Breonna Taylor. Why does justice continue to elude us?</p><p>For more than 100 days, Black women have mourned the tragic murder of Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman killed in her home by the Louisville metro police department. To rally the nation around Breonna, Black women occupied space, shouted, and protested. Black women have marched and cooked food to provide sustenance for others. Black women created art, wrote poems, and sing songs that spoke of freedom. Black women have become the face of the Say Her Name movement, fueled by our children’s blood. Black women have stood in solidarity waiting for justice – justice that was far too long delayed and on Wednesday denied as we learned that no one would be held accountable for the murder of Breonna Taylor.</p><p>As I sat in Injustice Square Park after hearing the announcement that inherently I knew would be coming, I wondered: “When? If not today, when will this world ever provide justice for Black women?” In 1965, Louisville city attorney Alberta Jones was murdered. Her case was never solved, and Jones never received justice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/25/black-women-breonna-taylor">Continue reading...</a>

Except that, where you might normally find sunloungers on a neatly landscaped terrace, this one has a “mud kitchen”. That’s because, rather than a private gym, cinema or other aspirational concept of the kind used to sell such developments, this London high-rise comes with the joyful chaos of a primary school attached to its base.</p><p>After five long months of no school, it is a nice surprise to hear the sound of (safely bubbled) playground games in full swing, and glimpse kids fooling around on the deck that hovers above the street. You might expect such a tower to have a swanky concierge at its base, but there instead you’ll find the school reception. Meanwhile, the roof of <a href="https://hackneynewprimaryschool.org/">Hackney New Primary School</a> is given over to planters for each class to grow their own food and get mucky with mud. It is a welcome reminder, in a world increasingly devoted to overpriced apartments for young professionals and foreign investors, that cities are for children, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/25/mud-kitchen-luxury-flats-attached-hackney-school">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Public Trust highlights the 640m acres owned by the country’s citizenry, lands that some in the Republican party want to sell off</p><p>Towards the middle of the new film Public Trust, about the continued push by zealous conservatives to privatize ownership of the United States’ federally-managed public lands, the stakes are laid bare: “If you don’t get engaged, you lose,” says Land Tawney, president and CEO of the nonprofit Backcountry Hunters and Anglers. “When you get complacent, things are done to you.”</p><p>Tawney is speaking of the 640m acres that are owned by the country’s citizenry. Few things in politics are as quintessentially American as the country’s vast system of public lands. No other nation on earth has this much property that belongs to its people and is intended to be management by the government for the benefit and uplift of all. Yet selling off those lands is still listed as a goal in the Republican party platform, and the Trump administration seems singularly focused on rolling back protections to usher in more drilling and mining.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/25/film-lays-bare-stakes-of-privatizing-us-public-lands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How we interpret our feelings depends on where and how we’re brought up, says professor Lisa Feldman Barrett - and not understanding this is making our lives harder</p><p>In early March, as the world began to realise that coronavirus wasn’t going to go quietly, psychology professor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/26/why-our-emotions-are-cultural-not-hardwired-at-birth">Lisa Feldman Barrett </a>was thousands of miles away from home. “I went to New Zealand because I was getting an honorary degree,” she tells me over the phone from lockdown in Newton, a leafy suburb of Boston, Massachusetts, where she runs a lab devoted to the study of emotions. She had arranged the trip to coincide with spring break so her college-age daughter could join her and see the sights. But as countries around the world began to impose restrictions, she started having second thoughts. “I was asking myself, should she really be coming, or should we be going home? Like, how serious is this exactly?” Her heart began to race as she weighed up the possibilities – and she found herself in a state someone else might label fear, panic even. Eventually she rang her husband, but instead of saying “I’m scared,” she blurted out: “I’m experiencing high arousal from uncertainty.”</p><p>This is only an odd choice of words if you’re unfamiliar with the paradigm-busting ideas set out in her extraordinary 2018 book, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/mar/26/why-our-emotions-are-cultural-not-hardwired-at-birth">How Emotions Are Made</a></em>. For Barrett it’s simply the language that most closely reflects what science tells us about how and why we feel what we do. Her family have adapted. “My daughter will say, like many college students, ‘I’m really anxious’, and I’ll look at her and she’ll sigh, ‘OK Mom, I’m having uncertainty and I’m having high arousal.’ Or, ‘I’m really depressed.’ And I’ll be: ‘Are you depressed?’ and she’s like, ‘OK my body budget is out of whack and I’m feeling unpleasant. Are you happy now?’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/25/im-extremely-controversial-the-psychologist-rethinking-human-emotion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I realised that Joe and I shared our own gay culture the whole time we were married – we both loved the film Beaches</p><p>I was raised to be a mother and a housewife; my mother was the same. Growing up in the 80s in a small town, I didn’t know much about gay culture. It was never talked about. I briefly dated a woman in my late teens, but it didn’t work out and I decided: I’ll be straight. At the time, it made sense. Little did I know, the guy I was about to marry was having a similar experience.</p><p>Joe and I met in 1989. I was 19, he was 23. He was just so darned cute. I was a strong, independent, outgoing kid, but something happened when I saw him. It was at community college in Auburn, California, and I just knew he was the guy. Soon after we met, my biological clock kicked in, and I really wanted a family with him. We got married a year later and soon had our first son. We didn’t talk about our sexuality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/25/experience-i-came-out-to-my-husband-then-he-came-out-to-me">Continue reading...</a>

Regardless of whether we “solve” this latest coronavirus, humanity now knows how vulnerable we are to pandemics.<br /><br />Can we mitigate the effects of the next great disease before it happens?

<p>This terrifying documentary looks back over the 93-year-old’s career – but at its heart is a short, sharp, shocking lesson</p><p>‘I am David Attenborough and I’m 93. This is my witness statement.” There is a tremendously moving sense of finality about Attenborough’s terrifying new documentary on the climate emergency. It is being marketed as a retrospective, a look back at his life and 60-years-plus career. But make no mistake about its true agenda: Attenborough is here to deliver a stark warning that time is ticking for the planet. It is a personal film – and political, too. There is emotion and urgency in that familiar soothing voice. At one point he rubs his eyes, reddened and damp.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/25/david-attenborough-a-life-on-our-planet-review-climate-emergency-documentary">Continue reading...</a>
