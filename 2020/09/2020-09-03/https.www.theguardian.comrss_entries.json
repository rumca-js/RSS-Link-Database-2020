Now some of the perpetrators are finally facing justice. By Giles Tremlett<br /></p><p>The last time Anatole Larrabeiti saw his parents, he was four years old. It was 26 September 1976, the day after his birthday. He remembers the shootout, the bright flashes of gunfire and the sight of his father lying on the ground, mortally wounded, outside their home in a suburb of Buenos Aires, Argentina, with his mother lying beside him. Then Larrabeiti remembers being taken away by armed police, along with his 18-month-old sister, Victoria Eva.</p><p>The two children became prisoners. At first, they were held in a grimy car repair garage that had been turned into a clandestine torture centre. That was in another part of Buenos Aires, the city that their parents had moved to in June 1973, joining thousands of leftwing militants and former guerrillas fleeing a military coup in their native Uruguay. The following month, in October 1976, Anatole and Victoria Eva were taken to Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, and held at the military intelligence headquarters. A few days before Christmas, they were flown to a third country, Chile, in a small aircraft that climbed high above the Andes. Larrabeiti remembers looking down on snowy peaks from the plane.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/03/operation-condor-the-illegal-state-network-that-terrorised-south-america\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/03/operation-condor-the-illegal-state-network-that-terrorised-south-america", "date_published": "2020-09-03 05:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus live news: Trump pushes to withdraw WHO funding immediately", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marketplace/item/1694428034044197/\">US public health departments being told to prepare November vaccine distribution</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/sep/03/coronavirus-live-news-trump-pushes-to-withdraw-who-funding-immediately?page=with:block-5f501b648f086d7ec3333fea#block-5f501b648f086d7ec3333fea\">signs Covid-19 easing in Brazil</a>; Berlusconi tests positive.
