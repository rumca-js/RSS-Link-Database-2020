Cases, weekly + 6,732 

Highest since May

Up 6% on week before

Contacts reached, down to 69.4% from 77.1%.

High cases, low deaths

(Dr. Andrew Bayliff)

‘First wave’

Most testing hospital based

Patients presenting with relatively severe symptoms

Self-selecting sample

Biased towards older patients with comorbidities

Most positive cases never tested, therefore undiagnosed

Many asymptomatic and mild cases

‘Current wave’

Much more testing

Many via track and trace

Therefore picking up a representative sample of the total infected population

Mortality rates for recent ‘cases’ will be biased more towards the statistically true outcomes

i.e. the true IFR
 
Testing rate is more than x100 from the early weeks

 ‘chalk and cheese’

‘apples and oranges”

Q and A

Will this vaccine change my DNA?


Contact tracing apps can sharply reduce the spread of Covid-19 even when only a few people use them

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.29.20184135v1.full.pdf

Non-pharmaceutical interventions 

Google and Oxford University

An app used by 15% of the population

Together with a well-staffed contact-tracing workforce

Can lead to a 15% drop in infections

And an 11% drop in deaths

Google and Apple.

Most returning schoolchildren likely to contract Covid-19

https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/sep/02/coronavirus-live-news-us-wont-cooperate-with-who-vaccine-china-uk-trump-brazil-cases-near-4m

practically all the children about to return to school in the region are likely to pick up the virus over the coming months

Necessary steps had been taken to make schools very safe places

Over the course of the school year, it’s likely that practically all the kids will get it one way or another

That’ll probably be because they pick it up over the weekend at a family gathering, or in the park in the afternoon, or from a classmate

We just don’t know because the virus can be anywhere
