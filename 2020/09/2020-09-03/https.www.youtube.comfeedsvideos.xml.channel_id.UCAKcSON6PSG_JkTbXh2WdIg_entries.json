It was the year we lost Prince, and Cymone was in town to play a series of shows at First Avenue in honor of his late friend. In the middle of Dan Patch Park, Cymone shared stories and paid tribute to Prince with three songs. Cymone then finished the set with \"We All Need Somethin',\" a fantastic track from his then-forthcoming, excellent 2017 album, \"1969.\" \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Sometimes It Snows In April\" \n03:52 \"Little Red Corvette\"\n06:27 \"When You Were Mine\"\n10:16 \"We All Need Somethin'\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nAndr\u00e9 Cymone \u2013 guitar and vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark, Eric Stromstad, Josh Kubasta\nProduction: Andrea Swensson\n\nFIND MORE:\n2016 interview and premiere of song, \"Black Lives Matter\": https://blog.thecurrent.org/2016/09/andre-cymone-reflects-on-growing-up-in-the-60s-premieres-new-song-black-lives-matter/\n2017 Theft of the Dial session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/12/30/brandi-carlile-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2020 Interview with Andrea Swensson:\nhttps://blog.thecurrent.org/2020/05/interview-andre-cymone-on-his-experiences-with-racism-in-minneapolis-and-his-hope-for-change/\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#andrecymone", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6505bKWD2sY", "date_published": "2020-09-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Interview: Radio K program director Julian Green (The Current Music News)", "description": "What's it like running a college radio station in fall 2020, as students return to campus amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic?
