Marvel's Avengers is out now, featuring six superheroes to choose from. Kamala Khan, The Hulk, Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, and Captain America all play totally differently from one another, so choosing which hero is right for you takes a bit of time.

The video above should help you make that decision, as Tony breaks down each hero's fighting style. Iron Man and Thor can rain down power from the sky, while The Hulk and Black Widow like to get up close and personal. All six heroes have a range of special abilities to level enemies and buff their stats too.

All three subclasses can be customized using new Aspects and Fragments. Different combinations will give you different ways to play and strategize. Stasis is the first new elemental power added to Destiny since the original trio of Arc, Solar, and Void.

Lastly, Persia talks about another update coming to Fall Guys in the form of a giant, randomly appearing hammer called Big Yeetus. Fall Guys posted a gif that showcased Big Yeetus in action but no further information was given in regards to when it would be popping up in the game.
