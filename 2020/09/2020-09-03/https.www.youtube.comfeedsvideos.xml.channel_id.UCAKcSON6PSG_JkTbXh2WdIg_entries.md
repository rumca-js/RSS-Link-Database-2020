Back in 2016, André Cymone visited Andrea Swensson at the Minnesota State Fair for a live taping of the Local Show. It was the year we lost Prince, and Cymone was in town to play a series of shows at First Avenue in honor of his late friend. In the middle of Dan Patch Park, Cymone shared stories and paid tribute to Prince with three songs. Cymone then finished the set with "We All Need Somethin'," a fantastic track from his then-forthcoming, excellent 2017 album, "1969." 

SONGS PERFORMED
00:00 "Sometimes It Snows In April" 
03:52 "Little Red Corvette"
06:27 "When You Were Mine"
10:16 "We All Need Somethin'"
