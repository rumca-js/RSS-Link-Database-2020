<p>Bell and friends are on relaxed, impeccable form, while Iván Fischer’s Mahler cycle draws to a blazing close</p><p>• In a 30-year career bristling with awards and success as a soloist on the world’s most illustrious stages, the American violinist <strong><a href="https://joshuabell.com/">Joshua Bell</a></strong> has always kept time for intimate music-making. On his latest album, companion to a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/show/joshua-bell-home-music/">PBS broadcast in the US</a>, he performs with friends – <a href="https://www.jeremydenk.com/">Jeremy Denk</a>, <a href="https://www.peterduganpiano.com/">Peter Dugan</a> and Kamal Khan – and his wife, the soprano <a href="https://www.larisamartinez.com/about-">Larisa Martínez</a>. <strong><a href="https://joshuabell.lnk.to/athomewithmusicAY">Joshua Bell: At Home With Music</a></strong> (Sony) contains eight short tracks, from Dvořák (arr Kreisler) to Gershwin (arr Heifetz), via Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Chopin, Wieniawski and Bernstein. The choice is personal and idiosyncratic, the mood salon-style music of the highest quality, impeccably performed by Bell on his <a href="https://tarisio.com/cozio-archive/property/?ID=40147">1713 “Huberman” Stradivarius</a>.</p><p>He and pianist Jeremy Denk play only the opening movement of Beethoven’s “Spring” sonata, but it’s enough to hint at the work’s serenity, drama and scale. You might wish for the whole sonata, but that thought is banished by the quick shift into Dvořák’s wistful Slavonic Fantasy in B minor (with Peter Dugan). Martinez is properly coquettish in Musetta’s aria from Puccini’s <em>La bohème</em> (arr. Kohn), with Bell revelling in the violin line’s twists and meanders. His virtuosity is on display in Wieniawski’s showpiece Polonaise de Concert, Op 4, every harmonic and trill lovingly placed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/12/joshua-bell-at-home-with-music-review-mahler-das-lied-von-der-erde-budapest-festival-orchestra-fischer-romberger-smith-opera-mums-with-bryony-kimmings">Continue reading...</a>

## Eight Detectives by Alex Pavesi review – a homage to the whodunnit

<p>A detachable fork tine proves fatal, in one of seven golden age-style mysteries that are nested within this metafictional debut novel</p><p>No other genre of literature has been subject to as many strict rules as detective fiction in its “golden age” of the 1920s and 30s. Crime author <a href="https://www.writingclasses.com/toolbox/tips-masters/ronald-knox-10-commandments-of-detective-fiction">Ronald Knox established </a><a href="https://www.writingclasses.com/toolbox/tips-masters/ronald-knox-10-commandments-of-detective-fiction">10 commandments</a> for its mechanics and insisted that it should present “a mystery whose elements are clearly presented at an early stage in the proceedings”. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/30/jorge-luis-borges-literature-review">Jorge Luis Borges</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/whauden">WH Auden</a> came up with their own formulae, the latter with an elaborate Aristotelian analysis in his essay <em>The Guilty Vicarage.</em></p><p>The world of the classical whodunnit is one of order, repression and good manners, which is why it was so successful among the English middle classes as a place to explore shocking subconscious desires. And there is plenty <em>épater les bourgeois</em> in Alex Pavesi’s first novel <em>Eight Detectives</em>. A set of seven golden age-style mysteries with an abundance of brutal slayings in genteel surroundings are rendered in a heightened pastiche of the form. These are nested within a greater narrative where their fictional author, Grant McAllister, discusses his own set of rules for the detective story with an editor, which leads to an eighth murder mystery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/eight-detectives-by-alex-pavesi-review-a-homage-to-the-whodunnit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Hanya Yanagihara’s A Little Life to a manifesto by Elif Shafak … Christie Watson explores kindness and courage in the face of suffering</p><p>When we talk of compassion, suffering is never very far away, as the origin of the word attests: the Latin <em>compassio </em>means “suffering with”. During this time of great suffering, we have also seen much compassion, both from individuals and communities. In words as in life, darkness and light can and do coexist. Compassion is the only thing that will matter to all of us, in the end.</p><p>The neurosurgeon Paul Kalanithi was only 36 when he was diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, as he relates in his memoir <strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/03/when-breath-becomes-air-paul-kalanithi-review">When Breath Becomes Air</a></strong>. Kalanithi explains why he gave up English literature to train in medicine, and charts the philosophical journey he took to embody the meaning and importance of compassion: “As a resident, my highest ideal was not saving lives – everyone dies eventually – but guiding a patient or family to an understanding of death or illness.” The book was published after his death, but Kalanithi lives on with his beautiful words.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/the-best-books-to-inspire-compassion">Continue reading...</a>

## I love Spider-Man – but would my son? How I learned a hard lesson about heroes

<p>He’s my all-time favourite comic character. But do the real heroes still wear spandex?</p><p>A decade ago I got married in a wedding outfit that, because of the shambles of assembling it, I can remember thread for thread. I had a new suit (dark grey, secret pockets) that I was shyly proud of; but with a couple of hours to go, I hung it in the wrong place in a public bathroom and the jacket was sprayed at close range by an auto-dispersing air freshener, the rich and tangy scent of which I could never scrub clear. My smart shoes, fine in the shop, turned out to be so unrealistically sleek-soled that I couldn’t stay upright on the walk to the venue and had to arrive in trainers. Way too late in the day, I noticed that my fancy dress-shirt needed cufflinks and all I had in my drawer was a pair of bug-eyed scarlet superhero heads, given to me once as a joke. I wound up at the altar, making my solemn vows, wearing a little Spider-Man on either wrist.</p><p>The older I get, the more that Spider-Man cameo, at such a big juncture in my life, comes to feel right. Where some people look to religious texts for spiritual comfort and a sense of continuity, others to Shakespeare or spirit animals, or the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/harrypotter" title="">Harry Potter</a> series, I’ve always been a sucker for the relentless reliable churn of superhero stories. I’ll watch or read just about any of them in a pinch. But Spider-Man has always been the one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/12/i-love-spider-man-but-would-my-son-how-i-learned-a-hard-lesson-about-heroes">Continue reading...</a>

## We need to reclaim 'populism' from the right. It has a long, proud leftwing history | Thomas Frank

<p>‘Populist’ has become shorthand for racist authoritarianism. But the first populists were progressive labor activists who fought for democracy<br /></p><p>For the last four years the American commentary class has been in a state of sustained hysteria over <a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/global-populisms/global-populisms-and-their-challenges">what they call “populism</a><a href="https://fsi.stanford.edu/global-populisms/global-populisms-and-their-challenges">”</a>. As our experts use the word, “populism” refers to the peculiar views of Donald Trump, whatever they are, or those of the leaders of Hungary and Brazil and Poland. More formally, “populism” is said to be the nightmare “ism” in which racist authoritarians <a href="https://ijnet.org/en/story/independent-media-defend-against-populist-government-attacks">attack the news media</a> and <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-08-06/pandemic-hasnt-killed-populism">ignore the authority</a> of the learned.</p><p>I welcome anyone wanting to join the fight against conservatism, a movement that will celebrate the 40th anniversary of Ronald Reagan’s presidential triumph this November. But whenever we hear our designated authorities and opinion leaders use “populism” as a synonym for everything that is wrong with that movement, we should remember that the word was originally invented to designate precisely the opposite sensibility.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/12/we-need-to-reclaim-populism-from-the-right-it-has-a-long-proud-leftwing-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By blending gospel and R&amp;B into nascent reggae music, the late singer became a cornerstone of Jamaican culture alongside his peer Bob Marley</p><p>Bob Marley and the Wailers were the band who transformed reggae from a cult phenomenon outside of its homeland. But it was the Wailers’ rivals, Toots and the Maytals – another vocal trio that expanded to a full band – who were, at least initially, thought most likely to cross over.</p><p>And why not? The Maytals had cut a swathe through Jamaican music in the 1960s and early 70s, releasing a succession of fantastic singles – Sweet and Dandy, Pressure Drop, Monkey Man, 54-46 That’s My Number (later re-recorded as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhH1Lxv-8sA">54-46 Was My Number</a>) and more – that had made them the country’s biggest band. They had effectively named the genre they worked in with 1968’s Do the Reggae. They had two songs on the soundtrack of The Harder They Come, the first reggae album to make commercial inroads in the US, and a great album of their own, Funky Kingston, in 1972. If Bob Marley stole their thunder, and he undoubtedly did, then it was as much about canny marketing as it was about the standard of their music – the way Island Records boss Chris Blackwell sweetened the Wailers’ sound with British and American session musicians, or packaged Catch a Fire (1973) more like a progressive rock album than a product of Kingston.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/12/toots-hibberts-pure-powerful-voice-carried-reggae-to-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

Whenever I do leave the house, she’s right by the door waiting for me to come back.

<p>Her debut, Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell, sold 4m copies - 16 years on, Clarke has written a second novel. She talks about chronic fatigue syndrome </p><p>Sixteen years ago, Susanna Clarke’s debut novel became a publishing phenomenon. <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/oct/02/featuresreviews.guardianreview20">Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell</a></em> is an unlikely story of intellectual obsession, set in a Regency England in which the buried powers of English magic are reawoken by two scholar magicians. The prose style mashes together Jane Austen and Charles Dickens for a tale that ranges across all levels of society as well as to fairyland and the battlefields of the Napoleonic war. The pages crawl with footnotes, one of the title characters doesn’t appear for the first 200 pages and at the end the reader is left hanging. It went on to sell 4m copies worldwide and was adapted for a BBC miniseries in 2015.</p><p>Neil Gaiman, an early champion, declared it the finest work of English fantasy in 70 years – but he also predicted that it “would be too unusual and strange for the general public”. The long-awaited followup appears on 15 September, and as Clarke admits from her home in Derbyshire, it’s stranger still. “When I finished it I thought: ‘This is so different, I don’t know whether anyone is going to understand it because it’s so peculiar.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/susanna-clarke-i-was-cut-off-from-the-world-bound-in-one-place-by-illness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If you’ve never tried frying tofu until crisp, then giving it a bath in a tasty sauce, you’re in for a real treat</p><p>After considerable experimentation, I’m willing to put a stake in the ground and say that I’ve found a favourite way with tofu. Of course, there might soon be another new favourite way, but until then, it is this: fry it hard, then braise it. Frying it over a high heat gives the tofu a crisp exterior, while a quick soft braise makes those crisp edges delightfully chewy and allows the tofu to soak up whatever sauce it’s put in. This was a point of kitchen enlightenment for me, and I hope it is for you, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/12/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-for-shaoxing-and-soy-braised-tofu-with-pak-choi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s tomato soup, and then there are these three versions: a rich, gingery gazpacho, a robust tomato and aubergine soup, and a classic cream of tomato soup with buttered onions and pasta</p><p>The thing about the end of summer is that although the earlier sunsets and cooler air signal a clear shift in the seasons, some of our favourite fruits are certainly not yet ready to move on. Sticky-sweet figs, juicy plums and blistering tomatoes are begging to be eaten right now, as if they’ve been slow-cooked to perfection in the residual heat of summer. These end-of-season fruits are now in their prime, with tomatoes leading the way. So make good use of them – you won’t see them again for another year, after all.

## Martin Amis: 'I was horrified that Trump got in. Now it’s looking scary'

<p>As his latest novel Inside Story is published, Martin Amis talks about cultural appropriation, surviving lockdown, and how he’s still chatting to Christopher Hitchens</p><p>The new novel by Martin Amis, <em>Inside Story, </em>which combines elements of memoir with fiction and in which Amis himself is the protagonist, features a pseudonymous ex-girlfriend called Julia, who complains about the kind of male-authored book in which it’s just “him going on”. Among the many drive-by assassinations featured here – at mention of the antisemitism espoused by Ezra Pound, John Wyndham and TS Eliot, for example, he summarises the trio as “two nutters and a monarchist” – the most enjoyable is the one Amis turns on himself. The novel is a revisitation of the author’s now familiar obsessions – Christopher Hitchens, his father, Kingsley; Larkin, Nabokov, Bellow, the New Statesman books desk of the mid-1970s. In it a series of women, including a fictionalised version of Amis’s wife, the writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/may/10/isabel-fonseca-writer">Isabel Fonseca</a>, tell him repeatedly: “I can’t believe you’re still going on about that.”</p><p>At 71, Amis, banging on still, remains highly entertaining, partly because his hangups coincide with universal anxieties and partly because the memoir aspect of the novel – if some of the names are real, much of the dialogue is invented – grounds his wilder impulses as a writer of fiction. A few years ago, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/21/rub-of-time-martin-amis-review">Anne Enright took him to task</a> for being all voice, and while <em>Inside Story</em> has a few gimmicky elements, including a central and (to my mind) entirely fabricated character named Phoebe Phelps – an ex-girlfriend who turns out to be that load-bearer of female meaning in Amis, an escort – it is a different beast to his other novels. Less schematic, more loose-limbed and rangy. We find the author fretting around the edges of his lifelong preoccupations, while wondering what precisely his own game has been. “What is the good of the novel?” asks Amis, the character. “What does it do, what is it for?” For that matter, he wonders, what is any of it for? Through the lenses of love, death and poetry, the novel attempts to find answers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/12/martin-amis-i-was-horrified-that-trump-got-in-now-its-looking-scary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Students are heading back to university over the coming fortnight, but the experience will be different to the one they expected in the summer</p><p>Starting university is, for most people, equal parts exciting and daunting. There are flatmates to meet, coursemates to bond with, new interests to explore and chaotic nights out to be had. But for students starting university next week, they have another emotion to add to the mix: uncertainty.</p><p>Hannah Tytko is starting a nutrition and dietetics course at the University of Surrey next week, and is unsure what to expect. “I’m going to be living in a flat with essentially six strangers so they’ll be seven of us in total. Luckily there are Facebook group chats so you can start to get a grasp of who you’re going to be living with. But I suppose under the new guidelines you’re stuck with these people,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/sep/12/i-suppose-youre-stuck-with-these-people-the-students-facing-an-uncertain-new-term">Continue reading...</a>

## A Zoom with Mrs Ranieri and Roy Keane's Doc Brown hair – lockdown behind the mic | Kelly Cates

<p>Kelly Cates on pundit wrangling, the challenge of broadcasting during a pandemic, and why she can’t wait to get back to work</p><p>I love that this season is starting in September. It’s always felt like the best time for a fresh start, to coincide with the change of seasons and the new school year. I’ve already stocked up on stationery for work and have a rainbow of coloured pens and highlighters. I much prefer to work off paper and find that the information filters through better if I write it down, but it usually ends up on an iPad for practical reasons. Sadly, evolution hasn’t yet caught up with my need for more than two hands to hold a microphone, steady a strong-willed umbrella in a gale, balance a sheaf of papers and still retain the capacity to handle the microphones thrust at me by departing players and managers.</p><p>The first live game back for me is at Anfield for Liverpool v Leeds. I can’t think of an opening-day fixture where the absence of fans is going to be felt more keenly. There’s a school of thought that the historic old grounds are never really empty. That they hold the energies of past atmospheres and ghosts of previous games and while that description suits my overly romantic nature and may well have an element of truth when completely unoccupied, I can tell you that on a Covid matchday, it’s a load of rubbish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/12/a-zoom-with-mrs-ranieri-and-roy-keanes-doc-brown-hair-lockdown-behind-the-mic">Continue reading...</a>

## Can Labour rebuild its red wall without losing its cities? | Andy Beckett

<p>The lost voters hate ‘scroungers’, liberal values and ‘political correctness’.

The “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/working-class-voters-desert-labour-stoke-on-trent-england-red-wall">red wall</a>”, a term coined by a Conservative pollster, James Kanagasooriam, a few months before the election, has been identified as the part of Britain central to Labour’s problems and prospects. Fail to recapture it from the Tories, the argument goes, and face being in opposition for ever.<br /></p><p>It’s quite a significance to place on an uneven, broken line of constituencies across north Wales, the Midlands and northern England. Precise definitions of the red wall vary, and it includes seats still held by Labour. But the three dozen that fell here to the Tories last year add up to about 6% of Britain’s MPs. Even when the red wall was a Labour stronghold, more Labour MPs represented other places.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/12/labour-red-wall-cities-lost-voters-liberal-values-">Continue reading...</a>
