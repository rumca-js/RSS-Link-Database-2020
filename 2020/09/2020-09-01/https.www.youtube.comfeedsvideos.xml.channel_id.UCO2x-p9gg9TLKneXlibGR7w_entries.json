While Apple has been known for keeping some of their most powerful machines fairly quiet\u2014even under full load\u2014with the exception of Mac Pro, this frequently results in thermal throttling, undervolting, fan bearing failure, and more. These are compromises that many Apple fans would take despite the relative decrease in performance as PCs are often (and sometimes fairly) viewed as loud or annoying\u2014even at idle. In this video, Snazzy Labs tries to make the best of both worlds: a powerful gaming PC with an NVIDIA GTX 2080 Ti and an Intel i5-10600K inside of a Lian Li O11 Dynamic XL that puts liquid cooling pumps, fan RPMs, and more to shame.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vosgP0yAlE4", "date_published": "2020-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
