So declared a 2014 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/dec/11/why-is-almost-nobody-making-tv-sketch-comedy-any-more\">Guardian article</a>, which focused on the demise of bite-size comedy shows, noting that they had been \u201clargely replaced by the topical news panel show \u2013 a rigidly formatted, aggressively male, preserve that provided instant gratification for a relatively small outlay\u201d. Less Victoria Wood, then, and more Would I Lie To You?. <br /><br />Fast-forward a mere six years, however, and sketch comedy has begun to tiptoe back into the TV landscape, influenced by the pace of short-form online comedy, where the typical TikTok makes The Fast Show look glacial by comparison. In the UK, comedy duos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/19/ellie-and-natasia-a-fiercely-funny-sketch-show-youll-watch-over-and-over\">Ellie and Natasia</a>, and Lazy Susan have made successful pilots for the BBC, while Famalam has run for three series (although its latest has, rightfully, drawn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/22/bbc3-show-famalam-criticised-for-sketch-of-jamaican-people\">complaints</a> for stereotyped \u201cgags\u201d about Jamaicans). In the US there\u2019s been a more steady stream of successes going right back to Key and Peele in 2012. The likes of Tim Robinson\u2019s cornucopia of weirdness, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/10/i-think-you-should-leave-netflix-tim-robinson\">I Think You Should Leave</a>, Arturo Castro\u2019s Alternatino and HBO\u2019s A Black Lady Sketch Show, now airing on Sky Comedy, have followed, showing that there\u2019s more to skits than just SNL. <br /><br />Masterminded by Robin Thede, the first black woman to work as a head writer on a late night comedy show (The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore), ABLSS is headed up almost entirely by black female comics. Thede herself possesses a wicked talent for portraying ne\u2019er-do-well men with zero morals; as the lead singer of 60s Motown quartet Claude and the Boppers, she turns a suggestive song about an ice-cream shop into a lewd treatise to a woman who will \u201cmake my supper, and do me and my brother\u201d (subtitles inform us that the group never performed again, but that the singer\u2019s grandson, Chris Brown, continued his legacy). She also excels in the recurring role of Dr Haddassah Olayinka, a fanatical black nationalist who states that \u201cyou have to ignore the empirical evidence that contradicts your beliefs\u201d, because of the similarity between the words \u201cempirical\u201d and \u201cempire\u201d, and decries her sister\u2019s \u201cblood diamond\u201d wedding ring. <br /><br />The series counts the likes of Insecure creator Issa Rae and Orange Is the New Black\u2019s Laverne Cox among its exec producers, and boasts a strong core cast. Ashley Nicole Black is a delight to watch as Trinity, a spy who is able to walk right into any situation because, as a dark-skinned black woman, she is rarely seen (her adversary, another black woman, evades capture by pretending to be a cleaner). Gabrielle Dennis ably leads a particularly right-on gang initiation with perks for new mums (\u201cjust to be clear, we\u2019re not calling it maternity leave any more because we don\u2019t want to be complicit in enforcing a cis-normative agenda\u201d), while Quinta Brunson is frustratingly brilliant as the hapless, insufferable Lachel, partner of the hapless, insufferable Chris (Thede), both of them incapable of following instructions, even when reading their wedding vows. <br /><br />Cultural specificity runs throughout the show, whether that\u2019s a skit about a rude Caribbean restaurant that turns out to be in hell, or a reference to getting a restraining order from the civil rights activist Cornel West. Natasha Rothwell (Insecure) pops up in a scene where a young girl\u2019s attempts to avoid being hit with a belt are turned into a Gladiators-style gameshow. Guest stars are more of the legends category \u2013 think Patti LaBelle \u2013 rather than flavours of the month.</p><p>The show certainly doesn\u2019t seek to appease white audiences (and why should it?) with long-winded exposition. There aren\u2019t even any white extras here, flipping the usual rules of television, whereby you can watch a whole series without a single person of colour appearing. <br /><br />As with all sketch shows, some things don\u2019t hit the target. The church where everyone\u2019s prayers are self-centred and vapid runs its course in 30 seconds. Fake adverts don\u2019t quite land. The friends trapped together at the end of the world \u2013 featuring caricatured portrayals of the members of the cast who play them \u2013 sometimes fall flat, and a debate about disgraced celebrities such as R Kelly and Harvey Weinstein quickly trails off before it can reach its full potential.</p> <a

How does a man dedicated to serving his community decide when it\u2019s time to hang up his white coat? By Tom Lamont</p><p>Frank Fisher\u2019s butcher\u2019s shop had been in business, he liked to tell people, for more than 300 years. A while back, a signpainter was commissioned to advertise this fact on an outside wall, in case any strangers should pass through the market town of Dronfield in Derbyshire and feel compelled to stop and inspect a time capsule. When I first visited, in January 2018, I found a low, square-windowed room tiled in faded beige and blue. Most of the interior was taken up by a walk-in meat larder, with just enough room left over for a counter, a crimson-stained cutting block and Frank himself. Saws and cleavers dangled, ominously, at throat height; you had to be careful not to impale yourself on the hooks that curled down from a black-lacquered carcass beam. Frank, who was 88 that year, moved with grace around the cramped space, having first come to work here as a teenager. When I asked how much had changed over the past 75 years, he took a good long look around and said: \u201cThe weighing scale used to be over there, love.\u201d</p><p>In some respects, Frank\u2019s was like any number of small shops in Britain. It had once been essential to the local community, depended-on. And now it was marginal, perishing in plain sight as the people of Dronfield chose to buy their goods in one of a trio of supermarkets, or to have deliveries brought to them by van. Open at 9am sharp, Frank had waited until 11.30am for his first visitor of the day \u2013 and here I came, not with an empty shopping basket, but a reporter\u2019s notebook. I\u2019d read about his shop in the Yorkshire Evening Post, and about how Frank was refusing to shut, even as his strength declined and he struggled to keep the lights on. His was the last butcher\u2019s shop in the middle of town. The last traditional shop on the main road. He was the last butcher in an ancient family of them, and he insisted that he wasn\u2019t ready to hang up his white coat just yet.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/01/frank-fisher-butchers-shop-closure-death-of-high-street\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/01/frank-fisher-butchers-shop-closure-death-of-high-street", "date_published": "2020-09-01 05:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Chilling out: cold-water surfers in Australia \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>Victoria\u2019s coronavirus travel restrictions have meant the surfing community on Phillip Island have had the local beaches to themselves this past winter.
