Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes place between Black Ops 1 & 2 and we’re here to get you caught up on the main plot and essential characters. 

Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is a sequel to Black Ops 1 rather than a reboot like the Modern Warfare series. With Cold War officially announced, this video will take you through the key plot points and characters leading up to the new game as well as explore some areas where Cold War might revisit unresolved story elements in Black Ops 1. 

Cold War will have some fan-favorite characters including Frank Woods, Alex Mason, and Jason Hudson. We'll also go over some key villains and who remain alive at the end of Black Ops 1. We know Cold War will feature new characters including a CIA Officer named Russell Adler who is hunting down a soviet spy codenamed Perseus. At the start of Cold War, Perseus has become active in stealing and sabotaging America's nuclear weapons program. The game takes place mostly in the 1980s and will also feature president Ronald Reagan. 

Call Of Duty: Black Ops came out in 2010, and ten years later Cold War is releasing on November 13 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The game will come to next-gen consoles, PS5 and Xbox Series X, when they launch in 2020. Although we cover the single player story here, there will also be a multiplayer reveal on September 9 which may detail how Cold war will tie into Warzone. We still haven't heard about Zombies mode, but it is confirmed to be part of the game.

A Ubisoft support page reveals that PS5 may not be backwards compatible with all previous PlayStation consoles, Ubisoft apologizes for Tom Clancy's Elite Squad's intro, and we may have learned the new name for Gods and Monsters.

A Ubisoft support page outlining the company's plans for PS4-to-PS5 game support may have inadvertently revealed that the PlayStation 5 won't be backwards compatible with PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, or PlayStation games.

Mobile game Tom Clancy's Elite Squad has changed its opening cinematic, after criticism that the logo of an anarchist group in the game looks similar to the Black Lives Matter logo.

Ubisoft's Gods and Monsters is set to have a new name, and it may have been revealed ahead of the next Ubisoft Forward event.
