With Cold War officially announced, this video will take you through the key plot points and characters leading up to the new game as well as explore some areas where Cold War might revisit unresolved story elements in Black Ops 1. \n\nCold War will have some fan-favorite characters including Frank Woods, Alex Mason, and Jason Hudson. We'll also go over some key villains and who remain alive at the end of Black Ops 1. We know Cold War will feature new characters including a CIA Officer named Russell Adler who is hunting down a soviet spy codenamed Perseus. At the start of Cold War, Perseus has become active in stealing and sabotaging America's nuclear weapons program. The game takes place mostly in the 1980s and will also feature president Ronald Reagan. \n\nCall Of Duty: Black Ops came out in 2010, and ten years later Cold War is releasing on November 13 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The game will come to next-gen consoles, PS5 and Xbox Series X, when they launch in 2020. Although we cover the single player story here, there will also be a multiplayer reveal on September 9 which may detail how Cold war will tie into Warzone. We still haven't heard about Zombies mode, but it is confirmed to be part of the game.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SakmfK_W88", "date_published": "2020-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Avengers - Official Kate Bishop Reveal Trailer", "description": "Kate Bishop joins our expanding roster in Marvel\u2019s Avengers: Kate Bishop \u2013 Taking AIM, a post-launch Operation in the Avengers Initiative.\n\nAs a master archer, Kate has the smarts, the talent, and the witty attitude that makes any enemy she faces quiver in fear. #Reassemble", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUrBibzpb0U", "date_published": "2020-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Marvel's Avengers Launch Week War Table", "description": "Tune in to a special launch week edition of the Marvel's Avengers War Table on September 1st, 10am PT.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ihVp43eWHI", "date_published": "2020-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5 Might Not Be Backwards Compatible With PS3, PS2, PS1 Games | Save State", "description": "A Ubisoft support page reveals that PS5 may not be backwards compatible with all previous PlayStation consoles, Ubisoft apologizes for Tom Clancy's Elite Squad's intro, and we may have learned the new name for Gods and Monsters.\n\nA Ubisoft support page outlining the company's plans for PS4-to-PS5 game support may have inadvertently revealed that the PlayStation 5 won't be backwards compatible with PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, or PlayStation games.\n\nMobile game Tom Clancy's Elite Squad has changed its opening cinematic, after criticism that the logo of an anarchist group in the game looks similar to the Black Lives Matter logo.\n\nUbisoft's Gods and Monsters is set to have a new name, and it may have been revealed ahead of the next Ubisoft Forward event. \n\nToday is the last day to grab your Play For All merchandise from store.gamespot.com, with all the proceeds going to Black Lives Matter and Direct Relief. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:20 - Looks Like PS5 Isn't Backwards Compatible With PS3, PS2, Or PS1\n01:21 - Ubisoft Apologizes For Latest Elite Squad Trailer\n01:59 - Is This Gods & Monsters' New Name?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9zy9trItxM", "date_published": "2020-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PlayStation 5 - Breathtaking Immersion Trailer", "description": "The PS5 will bring stunning visuals, faster loading, haptic feedback, adaptive triggers and 3D audio, creating an all-new gaming experience on PlayStation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3-Ox6PMyE8", "date_published": "2020-09-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Roundup of Best Games From Gamescom 2020", "description": "Our GameSpot panel discusses the biggest news and games that've come out of Gamescom 2020.
