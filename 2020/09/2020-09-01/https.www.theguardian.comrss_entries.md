## A Black Lady Sketch Show review – TV and comedy as you've never seen them

<p>From lewd Motown singers to an ‘invisible’ black spy, Robin Thede’s HBO series revels in memorable skits that liven up the world of comedy, and show that sketch shows are in rude health</p><p>The sketch show is dead, long live the sketch show! So declared a 2014 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/dec/11/why-is-almost-nobody-making-tv-sketch-comedy-any-more">Guardian article</a>, which focused on the demise of bite-size comedy shows, noting that they had been “largely replaced by the topical news panel show – a rigidly formatted, aggressively male, preserve that provided instant gratification for a relatively small outlay”. Less Victoria Wood, then, and more Would I Lie To You?. <br /><br />Fast-forward a mere six years, however, and sketch comedy has begun to tiptoe back into the TV landscape, influenced by the pace of short-form online comedy, where the typical TikTok makes The Fast Show look glacial by comparison. In the UK, comedy duos <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/19/ellie-and-natasia-a-fiercely-funny-sketch-show-youll-watch-over-and-over">Ellie and Natasia</a>, and Lazy Susan have made successful pilots for the BBC, while Famalam has run for three series (although its latest has, rightfully, drawn <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/22/bbc3-show-famalam-criticised-for-sketch-of-jamaican-people">complaints</a> for stereotyped “gags” about Jamaicans). In the US there’s been a more steady stream of successes going right back to Key and Peele in 2012. The likes of Tim Robinson’s cornucopia of weirdness, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/10/i-think-you-should-leave-netflix-tim-robinson">I Think You Should Leave</a>, Arturo Castro’s Alternatino and HBO’s A Black Lady Sketch Show, now airing on Sky Comedy, have followed, showing that there’s more to skits than just SNL. <br /><br />Masterminded by Robin Thede, the first black woman to work as a head writer on a late night comedy show (The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore), ABLSS is headed up almost entirely by black female comics. Thede herself possesses a wicked talent for portraying ne’er-do-well men with zero morals; as the lead singer of 60s Motown quartet Claude and the Boppers, she turns a suggestive song about an ice-cream shop into a lewd treatise to a woman who will “make my supper, and do me and my brother” (subtitles inform us that the group never performed again, but that the singer’s grandson, Chris Brown, continued his legacy). She also excels in the recurring role of Dr Haddassah Olayinka, a fanatical black nationalist who states that “you have to ignore the empirical evidence that contradicts your beliefs”, because of the similarity between the words “empirical” and “empire”, and decries her sister’s “blood diamond” wedding ring. <br /><br />The series counts the likes of Insecure creator Issa Rae and Orange Is the New Black’s Laverne Cox among its exec producers, and boasts a strong core cast. Ashley Nicole Black is a delight to watch as Trinity, a spy who is able to walk right into any situation because, as a dark-skinned black woman, she is rarely seen (her adversary, another black woman, evades capture by pretending to be a cleaner). Gabrielle Dennis ably leads a particularly right-on gang initiation with perks for new mums (“just to be clear, we’re not calling it maternity leave any more because we don’t want to be complicit in enforcing a cis-normative agenda”), while Quinta Brunson is frustratingly brilliant as the hapless, insufferable Lachel, partner of the hapless, insufferable Chris (Thede), both of them incapable of following instructions, even when reading their wedding vows. <br /><br />Cultural specificity runs throughout the show, whether that’s a skit about a rude Caribbean restaurant that turns out to be in hell, or a reference to getting a restraining order from the civil rights activist Cornel West. Natasha Rothwell (Insecure) pops up in a scene where a young girl’s attempts to avoid being hit with a belt are turned into a Gladiators-style gameshow. Guest stars are more of the legends category – think Patti LaBelle – rather than flavours of the month.</p><p>The show certainly doesn’t seek to appease white audiences (and why should it?) with long-winded exposition. There aren’t even any white extras here, flipping the usual rules of television, whereby you can watch a whole series without a single person of colour appearing. <br /><br />As with all sketch shows, some things don’t hit the target. The church where everyone’s prayers are self-centred and vapid runs its course in 30 seconds. Fake adverts don’t quite land. The friends trapped together at the end of the world – featuring caricatured portrayals of the members of the cast who play them – sometimes fall flat, and a debate about disgraced celebrities such as R Kelly and Harvey Weinstein quickly trails off before it can reach its full potential.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/01/a-black-lady-sketch-show-hbo-review-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stock split is merely cosmetic for company whose valuation seems to be controlled by pure psychology</p><p>You have to admire Elon Musk’s stage management. On Monday, the Tesla founder delivered a crowd-pleasing five-for-one stock split, transforming a $2,300 share price into a smaller figure to make ownership “more accessible”. The economic effect of the change was precisely zero – investors just got four additional shares for each one they owned – but Tesla’s shares surged 12% anyway.</p><p>On Tuesday, Musk produced a twist. Since investors are clearly keen to throw money at Tesla at almost any price, the company will issue new shares to raise $5bn for “general corporate purposes”. The explanation was gloriously vague but, in Tesla’s shoes, you can afford to be loose. With a stock valuation of $460bn, the new shares represent minimal dilution for existing investors. It would almost be silly not to take advantage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/sep/01/even-die-hard-fans-must-be-wondering-if-tesla-stock-is-moving-too-fast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister must choose between the promises he made to ‘red wall’ voters, Tory orthodoxy and heading into the political unknown</p><p>Over the past four decades, Britain has been beset by slowing productivity, soaring inequality, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/feb/12/climate-and-economic-risks-threaten-2008-style-systemic-collapse" title="">an environmental emergency and repeated financial crises</a>. Coronavirus has thrown into sharp relief existing disparities, and also created new ones. Those in power seem unwilling to deal with a broken system. They shy away from developing the ideas needed for reform. What’s offered is performance rather than policy. In this regard, Boris Johnson’s government excelled: it mouthed the words but didn’t mean any of them.</p><p>That is why the leaks suggesting that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/aug/31/tories-warn-rishi-sunak-amid-covid-tax-hike-rumours" title="">contemplating</a> a radical and redistributive budget – with taxes raised on the wealthy, big businesses, pensions and motorists – have to be taken with a pound of salt.

<p>Rising Phoenix, a new film about the Paralympics, features disabled rappers on its soundtrack.

<p>The visionary architect behind some of the world’s favourite landmarks – and some of its most expensive housing – is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/01/richard-rogers-one-of-uks-top-architects-to-retire">hanging up his pencil</a>. Our critic assesses his impact</p><p>Richard Rogers has never been the retiring type. He made his name with buildings that exploded their inner workings on to their outsides, dressing galleries and offices with rainbow symphonies of ducts and pipes. He became known for an equally colourful neon wardrobe, along with his love of public debate and bon viveur lifestyle. Now it seems the time has come for the 87-year-old architect to hang up his pencil: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/01/richard-rogers-one-of-uks-top-architects-to-retire">he is </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/01/richard-rogers-one-of-uks-top-architects-to-retire">formally stepping down from the practice</a> he founded more than 40 years ago.</p><p>Not that the pencil was ever Rogers’ favoured tool. He has always been, by his own admission, a terrible draughtsman, and he is dyslexic. He prefers to talk, ideally over a glass of wine and good Italian food. A tutor’s report from 1958 concluded: “His designs will continue to suffer while his drawing is so bad, his method of work so chaotic and his critical judgment so inarticulate.” Yet in his four decades in practice, and as an advisor to government, Lord Rogers of Riverside has probably influenced the face of urban Britain more than any other architect of the late 20th century.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/01/bamboo-airports-psychedelic-oil-refineries-richard-rogers-thrilling-legacy-expensive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thinktanks such as Policy Exchange are working to shift power away from state institutions – into the prime minister’s office</p><p>To accumulate power, a government with authoritarian tendencies must first destroy power. It must reduce rival centres of power – the judiciary, the civil service, academia, broadcasters, local government, civil society – to satellites of its own authority, controlled from the centre, deprived of independent action. But it must do this while claiming to act in the people’s name.</p><p>So it needs an apparatus of justification: arguments that can be fed through a sympathetic press and manufactured into outrage against its rivals. This is where the intellectual work of such a government is focused.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/01/no-10-lobby-groups-democracy-policy-exchange">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Make the most of the summer glut with these imaginative, versatile recipes. There is even a courgette-based martini<br /></p><p>When home-growers speak of a glut of vegetables, it is usually with a tinge of pride, rather than a sense of burden. It means eating green beans twice in a week or giving away a bag of tomatoes. When it comes to courgettes, however, the word glut can take on a dimension of horror.</p><p>I speak from experience. At the end of July, I had harvested fewer than half a dozen courgettes from my tiny plot, each no bigger than a gloved thumb, and was ready to count the crop a failure. But, by mid-August, I was picking four or five courgettes a day just to keep on top of things – anything I missed soon grew to such monstrous proportions that it couldn’t even be given away. Everyone likes baby courgettes. No one wants a marrow the size of a baby. For me, courgettes present more than a culinary quandary. They are a storage problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/01/squash-up-17-delicious-ways-with-courgettes-from-creamy-carbonara-to-spicy-dal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The soulful singer had a worldwide hit with 1992’s Would I Lie to You, but he was dropped and his musical partner died. Now, he has poured his pain into a cathartic comeback album</p><p>Eddie Chacon still remembers hitting rock bottom. “It was 15 years ago,” he says. “And it sounds like something from like a bad movie.” Since childhood, he would get up at 8am and work on music. “That morning, my wife walked into my studio and I was just sitting there. She asked, ‘What’s wrong?’ I just said, ‘Nobody’s listening.’ I turned everything off, walked out, and I never went back for 10 years.”</p><p>It’s a warm summer’s morning in Los Feliz, Los Angeles and Chacon is sitting in the bright, white study of his 1930s Spanish-style casita and talking about his new album, <a href="https://eddiechaconofficial.bandcamp.com/album/pleasure-joy-and-happiness">Pleasure, Joy and Happiness</a>. If you know Chacon’s name it’s most likely as one half of early 90s US duo Charles &amp; Eddie, who were No 1 for two weeks in 1992 with the sweet neo-soul pleader <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G_UXvcr22rM">Would I Lie to You</a>. Eddie was the androgynously handsome Latino one with the hoop earrings and the mane of thick, dark black hair halfway down his back.

The paper, called <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/61/1568/56">The Toll of the Automobile</a>, was the first study of “road ecology” – a growing area of research that looks at the many ways tarmac dissects habitats.</p><p>In Britain, dead pheasants, foxes and badgers are common roadside sightings, but much of the environmental damage is hidden and hard to measure – roads fragment habitats and damage them through noise, chemical and light pollution.

## The butcher's shop that lasted 300 years (give or take)

<p>Frank Fisher, now 90, was a traditional high street butcher his whole working life – as were three generations of his family before him. How does a man dedicated to serving his community decide when it’s time to hang up his white coat? By Tom Lamont</p><p>Frank Fisher’s butcher’s shop had been in business, he liked to tell people, for more than 300 years. A while back, a signpainter was commissioned to advertise this fact on an outside wall, in case any strangers should pass through the market town of Dronfield in Derbyshire and feel compelled to stop and inspect a time capsule. When I first visited, in January 2018, I found a low, square-windowed room tiled in faded beige and blue. Most of the interior was taken up by a walk-in meat larder, with just enough room left over for a counter, a crimson-stained cutting block and Frank himself. Saws and cleavers dangled, ominously, at throat height; you had to be careful not to impale yourself on the hooks that curled down from a black-lacquered carcass beam. Frank, who was 88 that year, moved with grace around the cramped space, having first come to work here as a teenager. When I asked how much had changed over the past 75 years, he took a good long look around and said: “The weighing scale used to be over there, love.”</p><p>In some respects, Frank’s was like any number of small shops in Britain. It had once been essential to the local community, depended-on. And now it was marginal, perishing in plain sight as the people of Dronfield chose to buy their goods in one of a trio of supermarkets, or to have deliveries brought to them by van. Open at 9am sharp, Frank had waited until 11.30am for his first visitor of the day – and here I came, not with an empty shopping basket, but a reporter’s notebook. I’d read about his shop in the Yorkshire Evening Post, and about how Frank was refusing to shut, even as his strength declined and he struggled to keep the lights on. His was the last butcher’s shop in the middle of town. The last traditional shop on the main road. He was the last butcher in an ancient family of them, and he insisted that he wasn’t ready to hang up his white coat just yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/01/frank-fisher-butchers-shop-closure-death-of-high-street">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Across Europe, millions of young people live in undocumented limbo, in fear of deportation from the countries they grew up in because of hostile migration policies. Now, inspired by their US counterparts, they are fighting for recognition and residency<br /></p><p>The US Dreamers – young people who arrived in the country as children – have spent the past 20 years focused on their fight for the legal right to live, study and work there. In 2012 they secured an intervention from the then president, Barack Obama, who paved the way for their legal status with the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme. In Europe, populist politicians and the rightwing press still fuel the perception that the undocumented population is a faceless mass of opportunists. It is not well understood that the majority of people without papers are young people, many of whom arrived in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news">Europe</a> as small children, and some were even born there. Now, inspired by their US counterparts, they are fighting for recognition and residency.</p><p>The journalist <strong>Charlotte Alfred</strong> tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys</strong> about how Europe forces its Dreamers to live in the shadows. Charlotte interviewed<strong> Ijeoma Moore </strong>who at 15 was put in a detention centre and narrowly avoided deportation three times. A decade on, Moore is still not a UK citizen. She will not officially become British until she turns 33 – 31 years after she arrived in the country and picked up a<strong> </strong>London accent. The journalist <strong>Giacomo Zandonini </strong>discusses the case of <strong>Luca Neves</strong>, who was born in Rome and has always lived there, but for 12 years has been undocumented, trapped by hardline migration laws.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/01/who-are-europe-dreamers-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
