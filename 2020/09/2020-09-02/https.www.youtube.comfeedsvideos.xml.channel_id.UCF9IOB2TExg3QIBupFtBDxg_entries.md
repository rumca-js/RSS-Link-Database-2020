Most returning schoolchildren likely to contract Covid-19

practically all the children about to return to school in the region are likely to pick up the virus over the coming months

Necessary steps had been taken to make schools very safe places

Over the course of the school year, it’s likely that practically all the kids will get it one way or another

That’ll probably be because they pick it up over the weekend at a family gathering, or in the park in the afternoon, or from a classmate

We just don’t know because the virus can be anywhere

University of Oxford and AstraZeneca

Development of COVID-19 vaccine AZD1222 expands into US Phase III clinical trial across all adult age groups (AZ, 31st August)

https://www.astrazeneca.com/content/astraz/media-centre/press-releases/2020/development-of-covid-19-vaccine-azd1222-expands-into-us-phase-iii-clinical-trial-across-all-adult-age-groups.html

https://www.inverse.com/mind-body/3-coronavirus-vaccines-explained

AZD1222

Based on a chimpanzee adenovirus

US, $1.2 billion

EU, ordered 400 m doses

1st deliveries October

Can make 2 billion doses

Millions already produced in India

So far

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31604-4/fulltext

N = 543

14 days after receiving the vaccine

91% to 100% produced neutralizing antibodies

Anti-spike IgG

These antibodies prevent viruses from infecting healthy cells

Therefore, likely to protect against COVID-19

Local and systemic reactions

No serious adverse events

Phase 3, 28 June, Brazil

Now

Final testing stage in US

Enrolment for phase 3 clinical trials opened

30,000 adults, aged 18 years or over

Diverse racial, ethnic, and geographic groups

Healthy or have stable underlying medical conditions

Randomly assigned

Saline control, or two doses of AZD1222,

Four weeks apart

Twice as many people will receive the vaccine than not

Testing for efficacy and safety

The immune responses of 3,000 evaluated in detail

Other late-stage AZD1222 trials have already begun in South Africa, Brazil, India, United Kingdom

Russia and Japan soon,

50,000 participants worldwide

THE MODERNA VACCINE CANDIDATE, MRNA-1273 

https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/phase-3-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins

So far

One dose caused some to produce binding antibodies

Two doses caused all to produce neutralizing antibodies

August 11, US, an additional $1.5 billion


Messenger RNA (mRNA)

adenine, cytosine, uracil, guanine

Translation in the cytoplasm

Ribosomes

Copy of part of the virus's genetic sequence

Protected by a lipid nanoparticle

Directs cells to make a protein that works as a drug or vaccine

Now

Phase 3 clinical trials began July 27

30,000 healthy adults 

2 doses

Test for safety

If the vaccine can prevent symptomatic COVID-19

? how long will antibodies last

THE PFIZER/BIONTECH VACCINE CANDIDATE, BNT162B2 

US / German

US, $1.9 billion pre-order

So far

mRNA vaccine

Generates antibodies virus-neutralizing antibodies

Generates T cells

Now

Phase 3 clinical trials started July 27

30,000 health adults in the US

Expected to expand to 120 sites globally. 

Two-dose regime

Encodes an optimized SARS-CoV-2 full-length spike glycoprotein

Which is the target of virus-neutralizing antibodies

To seek regulatory approval October

Up to 100 million doses by the end of October 2020

China and Russia

Skipped phase 3 trials
