<p>Guy Mitchell, who had his right eye removed at the age of five, rode a winner 30 years after first applying for a jockey’s licence</p><p>“I was feeling a bit better by Tuesday,” admits Guy Mitchell, reflecting on the Sunday night celebrations that followed his earlier success at Goodwood. The overindulgence was well earned, a party 30 years in the making, to mark the moment he became the first jockey with only one eye to ride a winner in Britain.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/sep/02/talking-horses-ex-policeman-and-friends-hoping-for-sprint-cup-glory">Talking Horses: French giving up on hopes of 20,000 crowd for Arc</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/sep/03/talking-horses-celebrations-for-first-jockey-with-one-eye-to-win-in-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leaving Game of Thrones behind her, the actor shines as a doomsday-prepper on a mission in this dark, sideways comedy with shades of Killing Eve</p><p>Two Weeks to Live (Sky One) stamps the words NORTH OF ENGLAND across the screen, in big, bold, sans serif capital letters. It drops us straight into the action in a roadside cafe that has a touch of the Edward Hoppers, then launches into a loud cover of Stayin’ Alive by the band Tropical Fuck Storm. Blink and you could be watching The End of the F**king World. Then Maisie Williams arrives, a seemingly naive young woman with a 1,000-yard stare and the surprising ability to pummel the life out of a burly bloke. Now you could be watching Killing Eve. Two Weeks to Live borrows liberally from the aesthetic of both, which means it’s about as 2020 as an argument about face masks in the baking aisle. Yet, despite such insta-familiarity, it manages to find a charm all of its own.</p><p>Williams updates her kill list from Game of Thrones to play Kim, who has been brought up in doomsday-prepper isolation in Scotland by her mother, Tina (Fleabag’s Sian Clifford, sporting an appropriately sensible outdoorsy haircut here). It’s a self-contained life; while most parents summon their children to eat with a simple “Dinnertime!”, Tina prefers: “It’s your turn to disembowel dinner, when you’ve got a sec.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/02/two-weeks-to-live-review-maisie-williams-is-out-for-revenge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Downing Street’s pandemic response is a toxic combination of control-freakery and incompetence</p><p>Not much about the government’s response to the coronavirus pandemic looks effective with hindsight, but once the decision to go into a full national lockdown was taken, the instruction was at least delivered efficiently. “Stay at home” was a message <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/britons-stay-at-home-under-lockdown-despite-easter-sunshine" title="">clearly understood</a>.</p><p>Some Conservatives even complained that it had been too effective, making it harder to coax people back into economic activity when that became the Downing Street imperative. Since then, the message has become garbled, and not just because regional lockdowns have been used. That concept is simple enough. The problem is rules that look contradictory, or that come and go capriciously.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/02/the-guardian-view-on-local-lockdowns-devolve-power-trust-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An outbreak of amnesia unfolds in an ahistoric, analogue Athens in Christos Nikou’s stylish tale – a fitting opener for Venice film festival’s Orizzonti sidebar </p><p>On the opening day of the Venice film festival, the arrivals are struggling to get their bearings. Things don’t work the way they did in the past. There’s a booking system to contend with and a mask policy to observe. We don’t know the names of many directors on the programme. We can’t recognise our friends and colleagues behind their myriad face coverings. It’s the 77th edition but it almost feels like the first. The new normal is weird; it’s going to take some getting used to.</p><p>If the Venice selectors were looking for a fitting film to open this year’s Orizzonti sidebar, they could hardly have done better than Christos Nikou’s splendidly poignant and creepy Apples. As luck or fate would have it, this is a pandemic drama of sorts, spotlighting an outbreak of amnesia that afflicts the people of Greece. With a neat stylistic flourish, Nikou sets his tale in an ahistoric, analogue Athens, modern on the surface yet seemingly in thrall to cassette decks and instant cameras. At a time when memories are wiped and histories erased, physical media perhaps provide a crucial link with the past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/02/apples-review-splendidly-poignant-and-creepy-pandemic-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rather than being seen as the man with the winning touch, many Tories are waking up to the fact that PM may be a liability</p><p>Boris Johnson’s complete lack of shame has long been one of his defining narcissistic traits. His willingness to betray family, friends and colleagues for short-term personal gain is common knowledge. In much the same way, his lack of competence – his inability to grasp basic details – has also been priced in to the equation, as no one on the Tory benches much cared. It was just Boris being Boris.</p><p>But something has changed over the course of the summer. Johnson is no longer seen as a man with the winning touch. Quite the reverse, in fact. Many Conservatives are slowly waking up to the fact that he may be a liability. Many prime ministers have discovered that being in the top job requires a different skill and mindset to that of getting the top job.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/02/boris-left-flailing-as-pms-limitations-become-clear-for-all-to-see">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New music by Ulver, Enslaved, and Emperor frontman Ihsahn is staying true to the scene’s original cosmopolitan spirit, while rejecting its murderous violence</p><p>On 8 April, 1991, Per Ohlin – the singer with Norwegian metal outfit Mayhem – killed himself in his band’s shared house in Kråkstad. His body was discovered by Øystein “Euronymous” Aarseth, Mayhem’s guitarist and leader, who responded by photographing the corpse on a disposable camera, before calling the police.</p><p>This was the first in a series of grisly acts by members of Norway’s black metal scene in the early 90s. The music, pioneered by Mayhem, initially drew attention for its fusion of metal brutality with ominous repeated riffs and echoing tremolo picking. It was a style engineered to be anti-mainstream; to test the boundaries of the extreme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/02/how-black-metal-grew-up-norway-ulver-enslaved-emperor-ihsahn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With our social and work lives hit by restrictions it is hard not to feel that every day is the same. From self-hypnosis to exercise bingo, here are some inspiring suggestions to break the monotony</p><p>Back in March, most of us were too busy hunting for toilet paper to worry about boredom. But as the months have passed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/29/working-from-home-might-feel-great-now-but-do-you-want-make-a-career-of-it">“lockdown fever” has set in</a>, with each day becoming depressingly similar to the one before. While few people miss being nose-to-armpit with strangers on a busy commuter train, many find that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/aug/15/working-from-home-was-the-dream-but-is-it-turning-into-a-nightmare">long-term home working leaves them feeling isolated</a> from managers and colleagues. And this is assuming you’re still lucky enough to have a job. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/aug/08/working-from-home-british-land-zoom-office-property">Zoom fatigue is rife</a>, and there’s only so many times you can shout: “I think you’re on mute, Alison!” before you’re ready to throw your laptop out of the window.</p><p>Meanwhile, our social lives have been hit by social distancing and restrictions on group meetings. Holidays have been cancelled or cut short as a result of quarantines. The only bright spot is that if you have school-age kids, at least they’re on the way back to class rather than under your feet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/02/time-to-break-free-25-ways-to-escape-your-groundhog-life-from-artists-dates-to-online-improv">Continue reading...</a>

## Reuse, renew, recycle! Is making new from old the future of fashion?

<p>Using ‘deadstock’, the leftovers from clothes manufacturing, to create something new isn’t just environmentally sound, it’s surprisingly inspiring </p><p>Shifts in fashion can often be signposted through semantics. Take the word “deadstock”. Formally an industry term often meaning fabric unused by the manufacturer, it has recently become part of our general parlance. Brands that use deadstock in their designs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/feb/21/marni-blends-old-and-new-fabrics-looking-for-beauty-in-leftovers">are increasingly on the radars of consumers</a>, who appreciate the idea of saving waste fabric from landfill. The fact that we are even discussing this in a fashion article suggests <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/dec/19/conscious-ethical-and-cruelty-free-a-guide-to-the-language-of-sustainable-fashion">sustainability is becoming a priority</a> in a post-pandemic world.</p><p>Of course, like with most buzzwords, there is more to deadstock than it first appears. In some corners of fashion, the term is more likely to refer to unused and unworn items rediscovered by a vintage dealer with a good eye and set of contacts with old warehouses. Deadstock Nike Jordans, for example, would be a holy grail item for any self-respecting hypebeast. The idea has also been questioned in terms of its environmental advantages. Some <a href="https://shopvirtueandvice.com/blogs/news/why-fashion-made-with-deadstock-fabric-is-really-just-greenwashing">argue</a> that, while using deadstock is obviously better than producing something from scratch, brands might actually be using what is called “available stock” – the extra fabric manufacturers produce along with orders with the confidence that this too will be sold.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/sep/02/reuse-renew-recycle-is-making-new-from-old-the-future-of-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shells on or off? Spicy or sour?

Sizzling earthenware dishes of garlicky gambas are a mainstay of the tapa repertoire, served swimming in aromatic oil to be sucked from the shells with a satisfyingly slurp, then mopped up with crusts of bread – perfect summer finger food with a few cold beers, or a chilled glass of bone-dry sherry. Happily, it’s also one of the simplest tapas to make, so if you can’t make it to Spain this year, you can at least taste the place at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/02/how-to-make-the-perfect-gambas-al-ajillo-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

When I first tried a lemon granita in Italy, it made me realise that I had made my own version in the 80s with my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/17/christmas-present-wanted-never-got-hungry-hippos-mr-freeze-care-bear">Mr Frosty ice-maker</a>.</p><p>I don’t always look for an easy way out of time-consuming kitchen tasks, but if there is a good cheat’s way, I am willing to try it (and I no longer have my Mr Frosty). This recipe uses the fibre of the melon when blended to mimic the crystallised texture you get from scraping. You can choose for how long you want to process it – the longer you do it, the more it resembles a slushy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/02/david-atherton-recipe-melon-and-cucumber-granita-cooler-dessert">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The TV presenter talks about her experiences of sexual assault and domestic violence decades before #MeToo, the British media, the menopause – and why she refuses to disappear<br /></p><p>She spent only the first 12 years of her life in Sweden, but the country of her birth looms large for Ulrika Jonsson. She returns to it again and again, to explain why it didn’t occur to her that, past the age of 40, her career as a TV presenter might decline: “Coming from Sweden, I’ve always grown up with images of older women around me.” In the media and on billboards, she saw women with “white hair, grey hair, wrinkles, natural faces without makeup”. But the starkest difference in the UK is the sexism, she says.</p><p>In Sweden, Jonsson, 53, is celebrated as a proud export, portrayed with a Swedish saying that translates into something along the lines of “a woman running her own race”. In this country, take your pick: good-time girl, unfaithful wife, improbable lover of the world’s most boring football manager and – most scandalously – mother of four children by four men. She has been, however unfairly given her successful career, largely defined by her personal life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/sep/02/ulrika-jonsson-on-depression-fun-and-fame-it-was-intense-i-didnt-cope-with-it-very-well">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Trash Free Trails project calls on walkers, runners and cyclists to take part in countryside clean-ups</p><p>Dom Ferris is a man who is building a career out of rubbish. He used to be responsible for organising beach cleans for <a href="https://www.sas.org.uk/">Surfers Against Sewage</a>. While working there, the Cornwall-based surfer and mountain biker saw many of the issues that he was dealing with on beaches replicated on cycle trails. But there was one key difference: while a proportion of beach rubbish is washed up by the tide, the litter found in the countryside is overwhelmingly (with the odd notable exception, such as fly-tipping) left by its users. It was this realisation that spurred Ferris and a couple of like-minded friends to set up <a href="https://www.trashfreetrails.org/">Trash Free Trails</a> (TFT) in 2017.</p><p>The news that the litter problem<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/26/littering-epidemic-england-countryside-code"> has</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/26/littering-epidemic-england-countryside-code"> got worse</a> since lockdown eased is depressing.

<p>Guardian US environment reporter Emily Holden looks at the Trump administration’s impact on the environment, and the consequences for the climate crisis if he wins another term</p><p>The United States is <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data">one of the most polluting nations in the world</a> – its factories, power plants, homes, cars and farms pump billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. By the end of this century, the earth’s temperature will rise by several degrees, many scientists say, if highly polluting countries like the US don’t control their output now. </p><p>The Guardian’s US environment reporter, <strong>Emily Holden</strong>, tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>about Trump’s environmental policies over the past four years, which have included reversing many of the pledges made by Barack Obama – most notably dropping out of the Paris climate agreement. She also looks at the proposals from the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, which include putting Americans back to work installing millions of solar panels and tens of thousands of wind turbines, making the steel for those projects, manufacturing electric vehicles for the world and shipping them from US ports. What the American people decide in November, Emily believes, is critical for the future of the planet. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/sep/02/what-has-four-years-of-donald-trump-meant-for-the-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>
