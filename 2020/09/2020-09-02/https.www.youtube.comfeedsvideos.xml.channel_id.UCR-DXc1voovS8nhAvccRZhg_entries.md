This video tells you all you need to know to get your D750 to work as a professional-quality webcam or for live streaming. Set aside that mediocre webcam and use the D750 you already have!

Here's a list of the things I used in the video to get the D750 set up:

Elgato CamLink 4K: https://amzn.to/3gQ7tNv
(Alternative) ClonerAlliance Flint LX:  https://www.cloner-alliance.com/cloneralliance-flint-lx/
Mini HDMI to HDMI cable: https://amzn.to/2Z0buZT
D750 External Power Supply: https://amzn.to/3jEQZtn
EV RE320 microphone: https://amzn.to/2YWGUQv
Behringer U-Phoria USB Audio: https://amzn.to/31S8SyZ

You can use other microphones if you want; many situations call for a lavaliere or shotgun microphone, and that may be better for your needs than a large studio mic like I have!
