In this video, Persia talks about an Xbox representative stating on Twitter that the exact release date and price for Xbox Series X will be revealed when the company is "ready". According to the spokesperson, it seems once we get the release date, the launch games will also be more clear. 

Persia also goes over the new details about Stasis subclass customization in Destiny 2: Beyond Light. The Beyond Light content will introduce three new sub-classes when it launches in November. All three subclasses can be customized using new Aspects and Fragments. Different combinations will give you different ways to play and strategize. Stasis is the first new elemental power added to Destiny since the original trio of Arc, Solar, and Void.

Lastly, Persia talks about another update coming to Fall Guys in the form of a giant, randomly appearing hammer called Big Yeetus. Fall Guys posted a gif that showcased Big Yeetus in action but no further information was given in regards to when it would be popping up in the game.
