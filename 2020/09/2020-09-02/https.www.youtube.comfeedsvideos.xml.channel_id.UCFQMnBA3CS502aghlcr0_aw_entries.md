Just One Dime's new Amazon Automation program makes 0 sense. 
They're taking 15% gross revenue on top of $10K fees per product.  Meaning that if the person is making 20% margin on a product, Seth still will take 15%, taking an effective 75% of your profits. Of course Seth insists that they will only target deals with 40% profits or more, but what happens when competitors come in the game? What happens when the 40% profits aren't as advertised. YOU LOSE, THEY DON'T.

Seth Kniep says that you have super low risk because worst case scenario one product fails, but neglects to mention that the real worst case scenario is all the products fail. Just one Dime is a bad investment in my opinion, as is all Amazon Automation courses because when they go upside down, there is only one person with skin in the game... you. You're the only one that is in trouble when these "great stores" don't work out like you thought. Food for thought.
