<ul><li>First major championship for 27-year-old Californian</li><li>Overnight leader Wolff finishes second, six shots back </li></ul><p>The whingeing, whining and gnashing of teeth over this US Open’s outcome promise to be more entertaining than the closing stages of its 120th edition. Bryson DeChambeau is a major winner. He holds as many US Open titles as Tom Watson and Gary Player, which is one more than Seve Ballesteros and Nick Faldo. The professor is not so nutty after all. He may, in fact, have changed the shape of golf inside four competitive rounds.</p><p>History will show that in a typically brutal US Open fourth round, DeChambeau lapped the field at Winged Foot. His 67 and six-under total ensured a half-dozen stroke victory over Matthew Wolff. The 27-year-old DeChambeau was the only player in the 61-man field to break par on day four.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/20/bryson-dechambeau-does-it-all-his-own-way-and-lands-the-us-open-title">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gregory Crewdson’s meticulously staged landscapes explore post-industrial decline in small-town America</p><p><a href="https://gagosian.com/artists/gregory-crewdson/">Gregory Crewdson’s</a> photographs understood social distancing before it became reality. His landscapes, which have a broken-down, apocalyptic cast, usually include a few figures, set adrift in different ways, apparently unable to connect with one another, or with the place in which they find themselves. Redemption Center is the first of a series of 16 taken between 2018 and 2019 on the edge of a town called Pittsfield, about 20 miles from Crewdson’s home in rural Massachusetts. He calls the series – huge pictures, seven feet across – An Eclipse of Moths after the effect of a swarm of insects around an outside lamp, that causes the light to dim.</p><p>Crewdson, 57, who is director of graduate studies in photography at Yale University, spends a long time scouting locations, then embellishing them, painting billboards, towing in car wrecks. He will contact businesses and authorities and ask them not to mow the verges or collect the rubbish for a while. Fog machines provide a dispiriting miasma; the puddles come from water trucks. Lighting on 40-foot cranes casts an otherworldly, even-handed light over the scene – nothing is out of focus; the list of credits that accompanies the pictures is like the roll call at the end of a movie, a legion of best boys and gaffers and key grips.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/20/the-big-picture-hard-times-in-pittsfield-massachusetts">Continue reading...</a>
