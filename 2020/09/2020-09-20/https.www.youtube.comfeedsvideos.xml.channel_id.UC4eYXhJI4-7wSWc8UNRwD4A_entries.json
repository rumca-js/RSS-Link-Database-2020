With BTS cooped up in Seoul, the group held true to the series's spirit by convening a live band for its Tiny Desk debut, and even arranged to perform in a workspace with a music-friendly backdrop: the record store VINYL & PLASTIC by Hyundai Card in BTS's hometown.\n\nOpening with this summer's inescapable \"Dynamite\" \u2014 the group's first single to hit No. 1 in the U.S., as well as its first song to be fully recorded in English \u2014 BTS leaned hard into the new track's celebratory, \"Uptown Funk\"-adjacent vibes. From there, the group dipped into its back catalog, seizing on the opportunity to showcase its quieter side while (mostly) staying uncharacteristically seated. The breezily propulsive \"Save ME,\" from 2016, ultimately gave way to a full-on power ballad in 2017's reflective \"Spring Day.\"\n\nThe latter track seemed especially true to BTS's hopeful nature: Introduced with a few optimistic words from rapper and singer RM (\"It's been the roughest summer ever, but we know that spring will come\"), the song reflects on a need to wait out hard times, even as the weight of present-day pain feels oppressive.\n\nBTS had intended to spend 2020 delighting the BTS Army in arenas around the world, only to spend these last few months performing in isolation. Released on the last day of a grim season, \"Spring Day\" provides a nice reminder of what awaits us on the other side. We just have to get through fall and winter first.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Dynamite\"\n\"Save ME\"\n\"Spring Day\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJ-Hope: vocals; SUGA: vocals; Jungkook: vocals; V: vocals; Jin: vocals; RM: vocals; Jimin: vocals;  KHAN: drums; DOCSKIM: keyboard; Kim Kiwook: bass; Shyun: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo and Audio by: Big Hit Entertainment; Producer: Stephen Thompson; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Subtitles by Renee Klahr; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\n\n\nABOUT THE SERIES\nThe Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Future Islands' Tiny Desk concert from 2011: https://www.npr.org/2011/05/16/136214794/future-islands-tiny-desk-concert\n\nFrannie Kelley | May 16, 2011\n\nFuture Islands' members showed up with the biggest amplifier we've ever squeezed behind Bob Boilen's desk. Then, because they're such nice guys, they tried to keep it down. Tamping down the levels didn't dampen their intensity, though, and by the third song, the band and the crowd were struggling to keep it office-appropriate.\n\nThe band's goal, of course, was to make us break (it) down. \"I want you to cry,\" said Sam Herring, who sings and writes all the lyrics. \"I want you to feel the way I feel.\" He said that, in songs like \"On the Water,\" he's using the fewest words possible to communicate most directly. Forget miscommunication, crossed signals, all that mess. \"I want to crush,\" he says.\n\nIn case that sounds kind of cruel, Herring reminded us that crying is a good thing. Therapists tell some people to do it more often. What Future Islands is really going for, with the mordant wit in the lyrics, the melodramatic chord progressions and Herring's yowling, scratchy voice, is catharsis. And catharsis can happen in your head and in your heart.\n\n\"Some people hear the music and they want to dance. They don't hear the words. And some people hear the words, but they don't understand the other side of it,\" Herring said. \"Those people come together and they share that space. They get the same thing out of it in the end, hopefully.\"\n\nFuture Islands came to our office and played some sad songs. The band did the aforementioned weeper \"On the Water,\" as well as \"The Ink Well,\" a song about saying goodbye to someone. Then they commanded us to move: Just before launching into \"Walking Through That Door,\" a song about missing your hometown, Herring said, \"Y'all can dance if you want to.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"On The Water\"\n\"The Ink Well\"\n\"Walking Through That Door\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IgdpEjO_X8", "date_published": "2020-09-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
