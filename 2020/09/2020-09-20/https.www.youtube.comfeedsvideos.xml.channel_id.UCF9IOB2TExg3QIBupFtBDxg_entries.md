Droplets, aerosols, surface contacts

Hands face space

Limit the number of our contacts

Reduce contacts in closed spaces, crowds, poor ventilation

Reduce contact with infected people, isolation

Spain and France

Younger people now older as well

Cases - hospitalization – deaths

Viral genetics have changed, but still causes disease and deaths

UK

Increases in all age groups

Not just more testing

ONS data

Proportion of tests positives increasing

+ 6,000 = 70, 000 currently have infection

App data

+ 10, 391 = 96, 531

Doubling every 7 days

Mid October

Cases, + 50, 000 

1 month later 200 + deaths per day

Now

Speed, action, enough

Current immunity

8% show antibodies

17% in London

3 million people

Most not protected

Geographical spread

Varies but essentially all over

Clusters have been getting bigger

Increasing everywhere

In patients

Doubling time, 7 or 8 days

Potential for hospitalisations and deaths to double many times

Seasons are against us for all respiratory viruses

6 month problem to deal with

Collective problem

No evidence the virus is milder than April

Mortality will be similar to what we have seen, slightly lower

High numbers would mean;

Direct COVID deaths

NHS overwhelmed

Other pathologies not being treated, early diagnosis

Heath effects of restrictions

If I increase my risk, I increase the risks to others

What to do

Reducing individual risk, hands face space

Isolation

Break unnecessary links between households, work and social

Science

Vaccines

Many vaccines generate an immune response

First half of next year

Before August 24

Encouraged testing for all those who were exposed.

August 24 to September 18

People who do not have symptoms may not need to get tested

Now

Encouraged testing for all those who were exposed.

Clarifications made on September 18, 2020

Due to the significance of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, this guidance further reinforces the need to test asymptomatic persons, including close contacts of a person with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Cases

6,706,374

198,099

Hospitalizations

Italy

Walter Ricciardi, (Ministry of Health’s scientific expert)

Distancing, masks, and controlling clusters are key

Use of Italy’s contact tracing app ‘Immuni’

Encouraging flu vaccines

Kept its quarantine at 14 days, refusing to shorten it to 7 or 10

Andrea Crisanti, (Molecular parasitologist, University of Padua)

Using its testing capacity wisely

Every time we get a positive case, even asymptomatic
we test everybody who is part of the family, social and work networks of that person

This is how all our clusters are now being handled   

rapidly pinpointing new positives, intercepting new outbreaks by isolating all the closest contacts

Italy did encourage foreign tourists

Clamped down on the party scene, prohibiting dancing in nightclubs August 17

Widespread civic adhesion to mask-wearing

Reality TV, hospital, morgues

but

Schools just starting

More going back to work

Equilibrium

WHO

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/media-resources/press-briefings

Global factors, warming world, intensified human activity shrinking wild places

Likelihood of spill over of a novel pathogen from animals to human

We know for certain there will be more novel viruses

Another so called disease X

Keeping windows and door open, do it all
