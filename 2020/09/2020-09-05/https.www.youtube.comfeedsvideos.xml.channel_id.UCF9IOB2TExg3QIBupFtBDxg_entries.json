COVID-19.\n\nDesign\n\nParallel pilot, randomized, double-masked clinical trial\n\nSetting\n\nReina Sofia University Hospital, C\u00f3rdoba, Spain\n\nParticipants\n\n76 consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection\n\nClinical picture of acute respiratory infection\n\nConfirmed by a radiographic pattern of viral pneumonia\n\nPositive SARS-CoV-2 PCR\n\nProcedures\n\nAll

(0.266\u2009mg) on day 3 and 7\n\nThen weekly until discharge\n\nEnd points, ICU admission and deaths.\n\nResults\n\n50 patients treated with calcifediol\n\nOne required admission to the ICU (2%),\n\nOf 26 untreated patients, 13 required admission (50%)\n\np\u2009 less than 0.001\n\nOf the patients treated with calcifediol, none died, and all were discharged, without complications\n\nOf
