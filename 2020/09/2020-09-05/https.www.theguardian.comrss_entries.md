<p>It’s a truly daft idea, but Quentin Dupieux’s film about a pair of robbers who try to train a giant insect doesn’t quite go the distance</p><p>In the wild old days of the film festival circuit, directors, writers and hangers-on liked to end each day with drunken discussions about the movies they’d seen. They’d say what they’d liked and what they hadn’t, and the things they’d have done better if it was their story to tell. Occasionally, around the time the third bottle was brought out, they’d brainstorm daft ideas: the sort of idiotic, joke conceit that sounds great at 1am and less good the next morning when the hangover has kicked in. That culture is conspicuously absent from this year’s masked, distanced Venice. But incredibly, it appears that one of those wild notions has now fled the bar, taken shape and grown legs. And wings.</p><p>Clocking in at a little over an hour, Mandibules is a rollicking, rambunctious tequila-dream of a movie, written and directed by Quentin Dupieux, whose superior <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/24/deerskin-techno-dj-mr-oizos-twisted-movie-about-a-jacket-to-die-for">Deerskin premiered at Cannes last year</a>. It’s about Manu and Jean-Gab (Gregoire Ludig and David Marsais), two dopey deadbeats who steal a rustbucket Mercedes to run a mysterious - and surely illegal - errand up the coastline. On the way, they’re disturbed by a noise in the boot of the car. “Maybe it’s a hair-dryer,” Jean-Gab says hopefully.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/05/mandibules-review-bizarre-giant-fly-comedy-runs-out-of-sugar">Continue reading...</a>

But most news outlets reported them uncritically, and this firehose of nonsense proved impossible to mop up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/sep/06/as-our-former-lives-dissolve-into-uncertainty-facts-are-something-solid-to-cling-to">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The acclaimed author on his new fantasy for young adults, and why he’s not interested in writing realist fiction - or reading it</p><p>Michel Faber, 60, is the author of three story collections and five novels, including <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/apr/01/fiction.reviews2">Under the Skin</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/26/book-of-strange-new-things-michel-faber-review">The Book of Strange New Things</a></em>, a tale of interplanetary travel written during the terminal illness of his late wife, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/08/books-interview-michel-faber-undying-a-love-story-under-the-skin">Eva Youren</a> (the subject of his first book of poetry, <em>Undying</em>). Born in the Netherlands, raised in Australia, he moved to Scotland in 1993 and now lives in Kent. His new book, <em>D (A Tale of Two Worlds)</em>, is a young adult fantasy about a 13-year-old girl on a quest to find the letter D after it mysteriously isappears from the alphabet.</p><p><strong>The author’s note to </strong><em><strong>D</strong></em><strong> says you began it 35 years ago.<br /></strong>In the 1980s, I attempted to write a children’s book called Woman With Long-Tailed Lloriphole. Many years later, I read the only two salvageable bits that had any kind of life to my girlfriend, the author Louisa Young, and her daughter, Isabel, and I felt, there’s something to be done here. When I was approached to write something to commemorate the 150th anniversary of Dickens’s death, I’d just moved to the south of England and it was gearing up for Brexit; I fancied writing a children’s book addressing issues of where we’re supposedly from and how much that matters, so I went back to the only book I’d ever attempted to write for kids.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/05/michel-faber-i-dont-read-fiction-any-more">Continue reading...</a>

While the gym-honed body is considered generally more attractive, it scores the lowest with women regarding monogamy and child-rearing.</p><p>For the study, 800 women were shown bodies ranging from lean to slightly overweight. The dad bod came out on top, while the gym bod came last. Dad bods scored high with positive behaviours: “Babies melt this person’s heart”; “This person tries to teach their child new things”. Gym bods were assigned negative traits, such as “This person thinks kids are annoying” and “This person grabs or handles their child roughly”. The research also alludes ominously to gym bods’ “pluralistic mating strategies”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/05/sorry-gym-bunnies-but-men-with-dad-bods-make-better-fathers-every-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The novelist recalls how some ‘wonderful stuff about commas’ helped her book surpass all expectations to become a No 1 bestseller </p><p> Looking back to 2003, everyone involved in the publishing of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/09/referenceandlanguages.features">Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves</a> </em>has reason to be proud, but at the time we were as surprised as anyone. Who knew there were millions waiting for a funny book on punctuation? Certainly I didn’t. My last novel had sold poorly (and I’d received a large advance), which made me poison as far as another publishing contract was concerned. So I decided that the next book must have intrinsically modest aims. The punctuation idea seemed ideal. Surely no sane publisher could ever say to me: “Lynne, I have to tell you that your book on punctuation <em>has</em> <em>failed</em>.”</p><p>I was 47, living in Brighton, working freelance. It wasn’t an easy time. For all of the 1990s I’d been under contract at the Times, first as the TV reviewer and latterly as a high-profile sportswriter. But in 2000 my sister died and I resigned my job because whenever I ventured out of doors I burst into tears. By Christmas 2002 I felt strong enough to attend a social event in London – and there I bumped into Andrew Franklin of Profile Books, who had by chance heard <em>Cutting a Dash</em>, a radio series I’d presented. “Do you think there’s a book to be written about punctuation?” he said. I replied, honestly, no, there were several fine books on punctuation already, and I wasn’t an expert. But he persisted, and a year later we went to the same party with a No 1 bestseller on our hands.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/05/who-knew-people-wanted-a-funny-book-on-punctuation-lynne-truss-on-writing-eats-shoots-leaves">Continue reading...</a>

## There Is No Game: Wrong Dimension review – a dizzying torrent of ideas

<p>This extraordinary game tests you to the limit – even as it insists that it absolutely does not exist<br /></p><p><em><a href="http://www.drawmeapixel.com/">There Is No Game</a>’s </em>overarching joke is that it’s a video game desperate to convince you that a) it’s not a video game and b) that it should be immediately closed down and uninstalled from your computer. There is no fourth wall: once you defy the main menu’s clear instruction “Do Not Click To Start”, you’re addressed by a sentient AI – a kind of benevolent HAL-9000 who, in a deep, French accent, berates your efforts to find a way past the opening screen and into the game that, the AI insists, absolutely does not exist behind the titles.</p><p>A cross between an escape room and early-90s adventure games such as <em>The Secret of Monkey Island</em>, <em>There Is No Game</em> requires logical but lateral thinking as you work to solve its knotted challenges while the AI natters and scolds your best efforts. Puzzles range from the straightforward (eg rifle around in the AI’s desktop folders to find the code that will unlock a password-protected file) to the arcane (use a letter grabbed from a comic book-style onomatopoeic exclamation to fix a section of broken railway track). In each case, the game is laced with wit and humour, its jokes compounded by the jolt of delight experienced when you find ad solution to a seemingly impossible problem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/sep/05/there-is-no-game-wrong-dimension-review-a-dizzying-torrent-of-ideas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At least 6,000 people say they caught coronavirus in Ischgl, dubbed ‘Ibiza on ice’, and their class action is gaining pace. Those who were there recall a terrifying week<br /></p><p>In the first week of March, Charlie Jackson had an argument with his wife. The recruitment agent, 53, from Pangbourne in Berkshire, was due to catch a flight to Innsbruck for a three-day “boys’ holiday”, skiing in the Tirolean Alps. Jackson’s wife, Carol, felt Ischgl, the resort booked by the group, was a bit too close to the parts of northern Italy that had recently been shut down to contain the spread of a mystery flu-like illness. But Jackson threw caution to the wind: he had already spent more than £1,000 on the trip.</p><p>Ischgl, one of the most popular ski resorts in Europe, is what Jackson calls “a boyish kind of place”. He and his friends had been visiting the town in the Paznaun valley, Austria, for the past nine years. The snow is reliably powdery from November to May. The compact nature of the place means you don’t need a car to get around. The facilities are well-run: Ischgl has 45 state-of-the-art ski lifts, three of which take you directly from the edge of town to the mountain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/05/everyone-was-drenched-in-the-virus-was-this-austrian-ski-resort-a-covid-19-ground-zero">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A classic late-summer dessert with bounty plucked from the hedgerows rather than out of a plastic punnet</p><p>Do you ever get that thing when you notice something once and then can’t help but see it everywhere? At the moment, everywhere I look, I see brambles laden with very ripe blackberries, and I’m not at all sure if my mind is deluding me or if there really is a bumper crop this year, but every hedgerow, nook and cranny seems to be intertwined with thorny vines and clusters of aromatic juicy, bulbous fruit that’s free to the fearless forager. Remember, though, that when harvesting wild foods, stick to areas that haven’t been sprayed with farm chemicals, so aim for woodlands and pathways away from the roadside.</p><p>And don’t pick only the fruit; the leaves are also edible, and can be infused into cream or fermented to make tea. High in vitamin C and antioxidants, blackberries are traditionally used to help cure sore throats, inflammation and other such ailments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/05/tom-hunts-recipe-foraged-blackberry-mess">Continue reading...</a>
