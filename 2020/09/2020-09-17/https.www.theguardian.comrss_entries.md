<p>Chelsea and Liverpool could both be vulnerable, Nathan Aké has a rare chance and are Newcastle the Entertainers again? </p><p>Last season Liverpool won 15 league games by the odd goal, and began their title defence in similar style, beating Leeds 4-3 in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/12/liverpool-leeds-premier-league-match-report">an indecently entertaining match</a>. But this habit is not an easy one to sustain, and it is worth nothing that they have lost five of their past 14 games, conceding 19 times in the process. It is true that now is a good time to play Chelsea – Kepa Arrizabalaga is still first choice, Ben Chilwell and Hakim Ziyech are unfit, and Timo Werner and Kai Havertz have not fully settled. But Werner still looked sharp <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/14/brighton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">against Brighton</a>, while Havertz can change the course of a game at any moment. If Chelsea somehow refrain from tossing goals in their own net, they will ask some serious questions of a back four that has looked more vulnerable of late. <strong>DH</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/sep/18/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister’s over-promising and under-delivering has to end. If he tries to spin his way out of the looming coronavirus disaster it will cost the country dear<br /></p><p>The country is facing a second wave of coronavirus because the government is losing track of the outbreak’s spread. Testing capacity is being <a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_D_Robertson/status/1305100187652837376?s=20" title="">outpaced</a> by an exponentially growing epidemic. Without testing the people who need testing, the authorities can’t see where cases are rising. With visibility of the disease’s extent obscured, its transmission is harder to slow. A second wave of Covid-19 <a href="https://acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/prepare-now-for-a-winter-covid-19-peak-warns-academy-of-medical-sciences" title="">could</a> be more serious than the first. The NHS, still reeling from the disruption of the last few months, is dealing with a backlog of patients. Winter is coming and with it the possibility of a joint flu epidemic and Covid pandemic. Britain has been put in a dangerous place by Boris Johnson’s administrative failure.</p><p>The government messed up its Covid response in the first wave of coronavirus, making <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/15/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnsons-crisis-blunder-after-blunder" title="">blunder after blunder</a>. Britain had no mass testing capacity and was forced to impose a damaging lockdown that plunged the economy into its deepest recession in 300 years. England recorded the highest excess death rate in Europe. Ministers have had months to put things right. A new testing system was devised. The rationale of coming out of the national lockdown was that a functioning test-and-trace system would help the government to spot and suppress local outbreaks. This was the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-politics-53220901" title="">“whack-a-mole”</a> strategy.

<p>The arrival of a host of stars is great for women’s football but contracts which last only a few months can also be disruptive</p><p>Two games into the Women’s Super League season and we’re starting to see some patterns emerging, with high-quality teams across the division but a few that look a cut above. The standard of overseas players coming into the league this summer demonstrates the way it’s seen now around the world, and will increase the quality still further, though I do have reservations about some of the signings.</p><p>I know of at least five clubs who have brought in players on short-term deals. For example Alex Morgan, the USA player and World Cup winner who has joined Tottenham, is a fantastic addition to English football but has joined initially for only four months.

## A slavery tour of London: the guided walk laying bare atrocities of the past

<p>From a kneeling slave at the Royal Exchange to the coffee house that was at the heart of the trade, a new tour is revealing a side of London that is often glossed over </p><p>Tucked down a narrow alleyway in the City of London, hidden in the medieval muddle of courts and backstreets, stands an ornate terracotta-fronted pub. Beneath a moulded frieze and a ye olde Dickensian lantern, a plaque declares that this was the site of <a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/nc/coffeehouses.html">London’s first</a><a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/previctorian/nc/coffeehouses.html"> coffee house</a>, opened in 1652. The Jamaica Coffee House was founded by Pasqua Rosée, the Armenian servant of a coffee merchant, and frequented by the likes of Samuel Pepys. What the plaque fails to mention is that this little establishment was also at the very centre of the transatlantic slave trade.<br /><br />“A huge amount of the City of London’s wealth came from slavery, but the connection is mostly invisible today,” says tour guide Ildiko Bita. To redress this situation, Bita and her group, <a href="https://sixinthecity.co.uk/">Six in the City</a>, have put together a revealing walk, titled Slavery and the City. Part of this weekend’s <a href="https://openhouselondon.open-city.org.uk/">Open House</a> festival, the walk unpicks the intimate connections between the City’s Lord Mayors, priests, financiers and the highly profitable atrocities of the slave trade. “Most walking tours tend to gloss over anything a bit difficult and end with funny anecdotes,” says Bita. “But this one is different. We’re going to look the uncomfortable aspects of the past squarely in the eye.”<br /><br />The quaint backstreet pub, site of the former Jamaica Coffee House, is one of the many eye-opening stops on the route. Where usually a guide might regale you with stories of the birth of London’s coffee culture, or charming details about the facade, Bita paints a graphic picture of a place where sugar plantation owners would meet with slave ship captains to broker deals over the fate of hundreds of enslaved Africans, thousands of miles away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/17/slavery-tour-london-guided-walk-atrocities-open-house">Continue reading...</a>

Yet against the odds, she experienced a creative and feminist rebirth</p><p>In 2018, as her marriage fell apart, <a href="https://bellaunion.com/artists/laura-veirs/">Laura Veirs </a>cried and biked all over Portland. “I called myself the crying cyclist,” she says. It was a new, impetuous hobby taken up after years of putting her desires on hold. When some friends asked her to join them on a 100-mile ride, she immediately kitted up and began training: 50 miles, 60 miles, weeping down her Spandex. “That got me through the divorce, honestly,” she says. Another friend wondered whether the optical act of navigation mimicked <a href="https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/emdr-what-is-it#1">eye-movement therapy</a>, which is thought to weaken the effect of trauma. “I was surprised by how much it helped get the grieving out.”</p><p>The theory – balancing intellect and intuition – hit Veirs in her sweet spot.

Having founded the Riki Watanabe Design Office in 1949, during the 1950s he worked with inexpensive materials so his products would be available to everyone, with pieces such as his 1952 rope chair and 1956 Torii stool bringing affordable seating into households whose residents had previously sat on tatami-mat floors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-artistry-of-japanese-watchmaking/2020/sep/17/the-timeless-appeal-of-riki-watanabe-the-godfather-of-modern-japanese-design">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Through lockdown, balconies went from an often forgotten outdoor cupboard to a joyful escape pod for millions. Now developers are catching up</p><p>Things were looking up for Sally Norman. Last October, she and her boyfriend, Jordan Parker, had saved enough to start renting their own place. They left their parents’ houses and moved into a little first-floor flat in New Maker Yards, a development of 850 flats in Salford.</p><p>Norman, who is 26, quit her job as a print manager in January to study interior design at Salford University, a dream she’d had for years. She got a part-time job as a sales assistant. “We absolutely loved the flat, and didn’t really notice the space,” she recalls. “We were out all the time and just came home to eat and sleep.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/17/room-to-breathe-how-we-entered-the-golden-age-of-the-balcony">Continue reading...</a>

I thought of her as a very serious person.”</p><p>Her father was the “funny one”, she thought, although her mother never appreciated his humour. “Now, as an adult, I understand that part of it is that my father’s jokes were often sexist, often at her expense.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/17/why-doing-nothing-is-a-radical-act-for-indias-women-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

## The battle over dyslexia

<p>It was once a widely accepted way of explaining why some children struggled to read and write. But in recent years, some experts have begun to question the existence of dyslexia itself</p><p>Julian “Joe” Elliott was training to be an educational psychologist when his supervisor invited him to lunch one day. The year was 1984, and Elliott was 28. As they were eating, Elliott’s supervisor mentioned that he had spent the morning testing a child for dyslexia. He had determined the child was dyslexic, and put her on a programme called Data-Pac, a new approach to teaching literacy which paired teachers with children for individual sessions that taught them how to sound out letter combinations. Elliott asked what he would have recommended if the child hadn’t been dyslexic. His supervisor appeared sheepish. He would have put her on Data-Pac anyway, he said.</p><p>Elliott thought that was weird, but what did he know? He qualified as an educational psychologist in 1986 and began practising. Over the next decade, he was often asked to assess children for dyslexia. At this time, most educational psychologists believed that dyslexia was a learning difficulty with a neurological basis, which affected bright children whose difficulties reading and writing could not be explained by the usual factors, such as low IQ, not having attended school or having a chaotic home life. The method for diagnosing dyslexia, known as the discrepancy model, was relatively straightforward: test a child’s IQ and their reading age, and if there was a discrepancy between the two – average-to-high IQ, low literacy – that child was dyslexic. Elliott felt unsure about these assessments. The children he tested for dyslexia all struggled to read and write – that much was clear – but their literacy difficulties manifested in different ways. Elliott was still junior, and he chalked up this sense of uncertainty to imposter syndrome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/sep/17/battle-over-dyslexia-warwickshire-staffordshire">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The PM has been attempting to quell disquiet on several fronts, says the Guardian’s Jessica Elgot, with backbench Conservative MPs rebelling over the government’s latest Brexit plans, Covid-19 restrictions and a series of damaging U-turns</p><p>When the cabinet minister Brandon Lewis was asked in the House of Commons whether a new bill designed to regulate trade within the UK after Brexit would break international law, he confirmed it would in a ‘limited and specific way’. The comments ignited a firestorm within his party as backbenchers and grandees tore into the government for threatening to damage the UK’s reputation for respecting the rule of law. </p><p>As the Guardian’s deputy political editor, <strong>Jessica Elgot</strong>, tells <strong>Anushka Asthana, </strong>it is not the only source of disquiet within the party. Some MPs are furious at new restrictions aimed at slowing the spread of Covid-19 that restrict gatherings to six people.
