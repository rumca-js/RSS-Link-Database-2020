It's been a huge week for PlayStation, but with the scramble around preorders and Xbox Series S coming in cheaper--and with a better subscription service--was Sony's PS5 showcase enough? 

It'll come as no surprise to you that the subject of discussion on this week's Generation Next is the recent PlayStation Showcase, during which Sony finally confirmed the PlayStation 5 release date, as well as prices for both versions of its console. On top of that, it showed off a number of new games to get viewers excited ahead of launch.

The reveals come following the Microsoft event, which also delivered a release date and prices for its two new Xbox consoles. If you watched the previous episode of Generation Next, you'll know that we think that the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S are priced extremely modestly and are poised to capitalize on the low cost of entry. But how do Sony's consoles stack up?

More importantly, how did Sony do in winning the hearts and minds of those who are interested in making the jump to the next-generation? Well, the showcase was full of ups and downs and, in the aftermath, there has been a great deal of discussion about key information that wasn't delivered in an ideal way, if at all. Whether it's clarity on launch titles or the messy preorder situation, the question of if Sony has done enough isn't as easy to answer as you might think, but we're going to try and do it.

Join Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan as they talk through the PS5 showcase, analyze the approach Sony took, discuss key moments from the event, and drill down into what has happened since.
