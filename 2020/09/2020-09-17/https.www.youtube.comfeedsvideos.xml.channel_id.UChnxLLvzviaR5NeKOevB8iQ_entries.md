patch notes:
hermod is sequencing the piston honda wavetable, plaits, and pico voice. all have a fair amount of chance set up in the hermod, so the sequences are shifting. bass is 0-coast. chord organ from music thing modular is doing the chords, which are semi-random. vpme qd drum module is being sequenced and modulated by pamela's new workout. vocals through perform VE, hydrasynth doing poly backgroundf stuff. zoia on effects.

A sample chop and flip is using pieces of another piece of music to make your own. A classic technique used in a ton of genres. In this video we'll go over some of the ways to make a chop and flip a sample, using the Roland MC 707.
