It's finally here! The Raspberry Pi engineers finally made USB boot on the Pi 4 official, taking it out of beta. This video shows you how to boot a Pi 4 off a USB drive for better performance and stability... or just for fun!

Check out my blog post on booting the Pi 4 via USB:

Can you get TRIM and UASP support on an USB SSD on the #RaspberryPi?

Those are two of the questions I answer in this video (hint: sometimes). In this video I explore the performance and support for TRIM and UASP for the following drives:

  - Inatech enclosure (https://amzn.to/2Zqan5S) with Kingston 120GB SSD (https://amzn.to/32iltvB)
  - TDBT M.2 enclosure (https://amzn.to/3ihOkFW) with XPG SX6000 128GB NVMe (https://amzn.to/2RdFhd1)
  - Corsair Flash Voyager GTX 128GB (https://amzn.to/2RbqcJ2)
  - Arcanite 128GB USB 3.1 flash drive (https://amzn.to/32jDuJT)
  - SanDisk Ultra Flair 16GB USB 3.0 flash drive (https://amzn.to/2DLRNgK)
  - SanDisk Ultra Fit 128GB USB 3.0 flash drive (https://amzn.to/2Fljg9P)
  - Samsung Evo+ 32GB microSD (https://amzn.to/32fmRz1)
