Pregnancy
NHS
https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/people-at-higher-risk/pregnancy-and-coronavirus/

Pregnant women have been included in the list of people at moderate risk (clinically vulnerable) as a precaution

CDC
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/pregnancy-breastfeeding.html

Pregnant people might be at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant people

May be at increased risk for other adverse outcomes, such as preterm birth.

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/healthy-pregnancy-covid

Healthy pregnant women do not fall more seriously ill from COVID-19

Healthy pregnant women do not differ in how severely they are likely to fall ill from COVID-19

Compared with non-pregnant women. 

Community based study

Two groups of pregnant woman

Group 1

4 million UK and 50,000 Swedish users

Group 2

1.9 million women aged 18-44 who responded to the US-based Facebook COVID symptom study

https://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2020/april/facebook-survey-covid.html

https://www.facebook.com/coronavirus_info/?page_source=search

Carnegie Mellon Delphi Research Center 

Group 1, UK and Sweden

Self-reported health data from 14,000 pregnant women

Of whom 629 were likely to have COVID-19 based on their symptoms

21 were hospitalised

Compared this with data from 387,000 non-pregnant female app users

25,000 were suspected to have COVID

600 ended up in hospital.

Group 2, US based

1.3 million survey responses from women

Including nearly 42,000 pregnant

2.9% of the pregnant respondents were suspected to have COVID-19

compared with 4% of the non-pregnant women 

Symptoms for pregnant women, Groups 1 and 2

Similar to non-pregnant people

Persistent cough, headache, loss of taste or smell (anosmia), chest pain, sore throat and fatigue
 
but

Increased incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms, nausea and vomiting

In the group of pregnant women who became most severely ill with COVID-19

Which could be confused with similar symptoms that are due to the pregnancy itself

Pregnant women
 
Tested more frequently for coronavirus

No more likely to suffer severe symptoms of COVID-19

Or be ill for longer than those who weren’t pregnant

In the absence of any other underlying health problems

Pregnant women with existing health conditions

Lung, heart or kidney disease and diabetes

More likely to end up in hospital with COVID-19

Similar to what has been seen for comparable groups in the general population

Zika
https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/zika-virus

Virus disease, Aedes mosquitoes

Mild, fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise or headache. 

2–7 days

Most asymptomatic

Microcephaly, other congenital malformations

Preterm birth and miscarriage

Neurologic complications, Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis

https://www.cdc.gov/zika/geo/index.html

There is no current local transmission of Zika virus in the continental United States, including Florida and Texas, which reported local transmission of Zika virus by mosquitoes in 2016-17

Nearly everybody, 80% of people

In all the age groups

In the first week

Quite severe headaches and tiredness, fatigue

If they don’t have this combination of symptoms, quite severely, it’s highly unlikely that their symptoms are actually related [to coronavirus].

We’ve also shown some negative signs in our app

So if you do have a runny nose, or congestion, or sneezing, that’s really a sign you absolutely do not have Covid.

Exposure among non-attendees can multiply exponentially

Especially if attendees live or work in communities where social distancing and mask-wearing are not enforced

These superspreaders can be bad without bound

Dr. Robert Redfield 

Speaking at a Senate hearing

Vaccine, late second, third quarter 2021

Face masks are more guaranteed to protect from coronavirus than a vaccine.
if all Americans embraced masks for six to 12 weeks, they would bring the pandemic under control.

I am going to comment as the CDC director that face masks, these face masks are the most important powerful public health tool we have

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-us-canada-54183731

These actually, we have clear scientific evidence they work, and they are our best defence
 
I might even go far as to say this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid, than when I take a Covid vaccine

because the Immunogenicity may be 70 per cent, and if I don't get an immune response the vaccine's not going to protect me
