While I have not much knowledge in 3D modeling and texturing, there are some big improvements, like a new physics based texture for simulating colors of the sky, a rewritten motion blur, a new filter to simulate how cloth flows physically, and some new deformation modes.

Itch.io now detects your Wine installation and lets you install Windows game if it exists. It doesn't allow users to specifically pick a proton or wine version, it just looks for the system wide install and uses that, so it won't be as efficient or flexible as what Valve has done with Steam, but it's a great first step.
