Nearly everybody, 80% of people

In all the age groups

In the first week

Quite severe headaches and tiredness, fatigue

If they don’t have this combination of symptoms, quite severely, it’s highly unlikely that their symptoms are actually related [to coronavirus].

We’ve also shown some negative signs in our app

So if you do have a runny nose, or congestion, or sneezing, that’s really a sign you absolutely do not have Covid.

Exposure among non-attendees can multiply exponentially

Especially if attendees live or work in communities where social distancing and mask-wearing are not enforced

These superspreaders can be bad without bound

Dr. Robert Redfield 

Speaking at a Senate hearing

Vaccine, late second, third quarter 2021

Face masks are more guaranteed to protect from coronavirus than a vaccine.
if all Americans embraced masks for six to 12 weeks, they would bring the pandemic under control.

I am going to comment as the CDC director that face masks, these face masks are the most important powerful public health tool we have

These actually, we have clear scientific evidence they work, and they are our best defence
 
I might even go far as to say this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against Covid, than when I take a Covid vaccine

because the Immunogenicity may be 70 per cent, and if I don't get an immune response the vaccine's not going to protect me

Facial Masking for Covid-19 — Potential for “Variolation” as We Await a Vaccine (NEJM, 14th September)

https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2026913

https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMp2026913?articleTools=true

Universal mask wearing might make mild or asymptomatic disease more likely

A form of “variolation” 

Inoculation

Generate immunity and thereby slow the spread of the virus

Viral shedding from the noses and mouths of patients, presymptomatic or asymptomatic

Shedding rates equivalent to those among symptomatic patients

SARS -1

A strong relationship between public masking and pandemic control 

SARS - CoV - 2

Recent virologic, epidemiologic, and ecologic data

Hypothesis that facial masking may also reduce the severity of disease among people who 
do become infected 

Long-standing theory of viral pathogenesis

Severity of disease is proportionate to the viral inoculum received 

Typical rate of asymptomatic infection, estimated to be 40% by the CDC in mid-July,

Settings with universal facial masking, 80%

Also less severe and less deaths
