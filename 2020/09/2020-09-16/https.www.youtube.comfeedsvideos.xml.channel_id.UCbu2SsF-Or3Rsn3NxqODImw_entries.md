Super Mario Sunshine utilizes the GameCube’s analog triggers to use FLUDD by pressing down lightly or fully for a different effect, but Nintendo Switch controllers do not have analog triggers. How did Nintendo adapt that to work on Switch? Can you use an original GameCube controller to play Super Mario Sunshine on the Switch?

Super Mario Galaxy was built around the Wii Remote and Nunchuck to take advantage of motion controls. How does that work on Switch? Did the developers just move everything to the Joy-Cons or have they mapped button controls? Is there Pro Controller support? All those questions and more are answered in this video.

Super Mario 3D All-Stars, which includes Super Mario 64 (originally on the Nintendo 64), Super Mario Sunshine (originally on the Nintendo GameCube), and Super Mario Galaxy (originally on the Nintendo Wii), is coming to Nintendo Switch with HD visuals and other improvements on September 18, 2020.
