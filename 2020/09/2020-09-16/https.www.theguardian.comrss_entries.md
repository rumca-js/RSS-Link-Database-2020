<p>The Yorkshireman’s relentless ODI form saw him compile a 10th century in the format in which he is one of England’s finest</p><p>The England men’s last match of the summer started with a slash, a catch, a cuss and a quick apology. Jason Roy threw his bat at Mitchell Starc’s opening ball and sliced a drive straight to backward point. In the silence of the empty ground, the curse he shouted out as he stomped into the dressing room came through loud and clear on the effects microphone. “Sorry for the choice language,” added Mike Atherton. It got worse. Joe Root was lbw to the very next delivery, so England were nought for two. Eoin Morgan was in now, while Jonny Bairstow waited at the other end, yet to face.</p><p>The usual thing to do in this situation would be to wind things in, the received wisdom says that when a team are two down without so much as a run on the board they ought to re-evaluate, retrench, and start slowly rebuilding the innings. Bairstow had other ideas. In the next over, he pounced on a rare full delivery from Josh Hazlewood and hit it crisply through extra cover for four. An over later, he hit Hazlewood for four more, square through point this time. Then, when Morgan took a three, Bairstow found himself squaring up to Starc for the first time; he was swinging it in, fast and full.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/sep/16/englands-home-run-ends-but-jonny-bairstows-brutal-brilliance-goes-on">Continue reading...</a>

## How Lamine Diack's 16-year reign in charge of IAAF led to a jail term

<p>Diack’s corruption, covering up Russian doping cases for bribes, was discovered after police raided a Paris hotel </p><p>The unmasking of Lamine Diack as one of the great sinners in the history of sport began with a police raid on All Saints’ Day in 2015. At this point Diack, the head of global athletics for 16 years and a distinguished figure at the International Olympic Committee, had yet to be implicated in a growing scandal involving the Russian marathon runner Liliya Shobukhova, who had secretly paid €450,000 to senior figures at the International Association of Athletics Federations to hide a doping ban.</p><p>But everything changed on that unseasonably warm November day. When police arrested Diack in his room at the Sheraton hotel at Paris’s Charles de Gaulle airport, they also uncovered his computer, which housed a treasure trove of secrets. And nearly five years later it has finally led to Diack – along with five other former senior figures at athletics’ governing body – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/16/lamine-diack-former-world-athletics-president-found-guilty-of-corruption-and-sentenced-to-two-years-in-prison" title="">being convicted of corruption</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/sep/16/how-lamine-diacks-16-year-reign-in-charge-of-iaaf-led-to-a-jail-term">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An involving Luca Guadagnino-produced look at the world of truffle hunting doubles as a sweet study of the relationship between old men and their dogs</p><p>A strange, funny, mysterious and rather beautiful film about an activity that’s recherché<em> </em>to say the least: truffle hunting, and it is a taste on which my palate still needs educating. (A very distinguished French film producer once took me and my colleague Xan Brooks out to lunch at a restaurant renowned for its truffles and when we failed to show the correct ecstasy, his expression of disappointment was almost priestly.) This film is also a heart-wrenchingly sweet study of the pure love that exists between old men and their dogs. The directors are Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw, who made the 2018 award-winner The Last Race about a stock-car racing track threatened with redevelopment, and with that and The Truffle Hunters, these film-makers are developing a sympathy for arts (and artists) who may be dying out.

## Johnson is tested on Covid and Brexit, his specialist subjects of ignorance | John Crace

<p>At PMQs and then before the liaison committee, the prime minister’s cluelessness is exposed for all to see </p><p>It’s no great secret that Boris Johnson has problems with women. And not just his wives, girlfriends and IT advisers. So going in to prime minister’s questions to face Angela Rayner – a working-class former care worker and the type of woman he has probably never previously encountered – who was standing in for the self-isolating Keir Starmer, Johnson’s sole objective was to try to avoid being his normal aggressive, condescending, patronising self. And though he did occasionally peer across the dispatch box, as if to check whether Rayner was from another planet, he did just about hold it together. There were no jokes or insults. This was about as close to polite as Boris can manage.</p><p>Rayner appeared understandably nervous at first – this was her first outing at PMQs – but quickly got into her stride with a story about a man called Keir who couldn’t get to work that morning, before reminding Boris that she had once worked in the care sector and did he have a clue what the average wage for someone working in that profession was? He didn’t, but wasn’t bothered. He was just focused on trying not to sound too rude.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/16/boris-johnson-is-tested-on-covid-and-brexit-his-specialist-subjects-of-ignorance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister believes that provoking chaos will get him a better deal in EU negotiations. He is wrong</p><p>To outside observers of Boris Johnson’s government, it can be difficult to tell the difference between partisan provocation and rank incompetence. Both generate an aura of chaos. It does not help that members of Mr Johnson’s own cabinet also struggle to understand what is going on.</p><p>On a question as vital as the UK’s willingness to observe international law, there is confusion at the highest levels. Earlier this week, the Conservative frontbench <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/14/brexit-internal-market-bill-passes-by-77-votes-amid-tory-party-tension" title="">voted</a> for the internal market bill that repudiates aspects of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, thus reneging on a ratified treaty. Ministers who worry that they are breaking international law comfort themselves that the breach is insubstantial. It is only “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/08/government-admits-new-brexit-bill-will-break-international-law" title="">limited and specific</a>”, or so Brandon Lewis, the Northern Ireland secretary, told the Commons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/16/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-brexit-and-the-law-wilful-incompetence">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Maureen Paley, London</strong><br />Wearing has abandoned the video art that won her the Turner prize and taken up watercolours and oils to create a soul-baring investigation of the human condition</p><p>A face wearing a mask over mouth and nose greets you as you enter Gillian Wearing’s exhibition Lockdown. It is like all the masked faces you pass at stations or in the supermarket, but the eyes are empty holes, and underneath the face covering is a second mask, lifelike and made of smooth latex. The outer mask is easy to remove: you take it off and feel like yourself again. It is a lot harder to remove the mask that is your face. But in the quiet and loneliness of lockdown earlier this year, Wearing set out to peel off all the layers and see herself inside herself, a woman without a mask.</p><p>This surreal sculpture is the only new work in this show that looks like a “Wearing”. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/04/gillian-wearing-whitechapel-gallery-feature">Turner </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/mar/04/gillian-wearing-whitechapel-gallery-feature">prize winner</a> is famous for videos and photographs. The first mask she strips off here is her official artistic identity as someone who works with a camera. She comes before us naked, as she might have looked in her first year at art school: not a famous conceptual artist, just a sincere nobody who likes to draw and paint.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/16/gillian-wearing-lockdown-self-portraits-maureen-paley-gallery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The vogue for pop stars sticking close to their own biopics has obvious perils, but Madonna’s mastery of image-making could make this a true star turn<br /></p><p>A great deal of excitement greeted the news, on Tuesday, that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/15/madonna-to-direct-and-co-write-her-own-biopic">Madonna would direct her own biopic</a>, from a screenplay written by the singer with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/diablo-cody">Diablo Cody</a> (Juno, Young Adult). Millions of admirers of the singer’s career as an icon of music and pop culture were joined by dozens of fans of her film career in celebrating the announcement. But what does Madonna helming her own biopic presage for the quality of the movie to come?</p><p>Initial signs, it must be said, are middling. In producing her own biopic, Madge is joining a recent spate of musical biopics including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/rocketman-review-elton-john-biopic-thats-better-at-the-tiaras-than-the-tantrums">Rocketman</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/oct/23/bohemian-rhapsody-review-freddie-mercury-biopic-bites-the-dust">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>, both of which were produced by their subjects, politely received by critics, in contention for awards, and fared well at the box office. At the start of both films, there were concerns that the movies would lead to a soft-soaping of their subjects: Sacha Baron Cohen quit the Queen movie early on, saying in essence that the film was too much about the success of the band Queen and not enough about Freddie Mercury; he was replaced by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/25/oscar-winner-rami-malek-bohemian-rhapsody-freddie-mercury-the-first-best-actor-of-arab-heritage">Rami Malek, who duly won an Oscar</a>. This stuff pleases the fans, and the acts of mimicry involved invariably lead to plaudits for the actors involved (not least because we all know the celebrities they are imitating, and can therefore easily judge whether the impression is successful), but does it make for great cinema? This writer would argue not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/16/express-yourself-why-madonna-directing-her-own-biopic-isnt-as-ominous-as-it-sounds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jude Law and Naomie Harris head the show that also includes an as-live broadcast from immersive theatre specialists Punchdrunk</p><p>Summer 2020 has been a strange one. But the eerily weird summer that Jude Law is having in The Third Day – a new Sky original drama from Utopia writer Dennis Kelly and immersive theatre company Punchdrunk’s artistic director, Felix Barrett – could give it a run for its money. Set on the real-life island of Osea, Essex, Law plays city-dweller Sam, who finds himself stranded when the tide cuts Osea off from the mainland. As the islanders gear up for their bizarre festival, Sam begins to realise that the people of Osea are stranger and more dangerous than he first thought.</p><p>The Third Day is a unique proposition. It’s comprised of three separate but interconnected stories that all take place on Osea. The first, titled Summer, is led by Law, the second, Winter, by Naomie Harris – and Autumn is a bold theatrical broadcast event on Sky Arts (Saturday 3 October), orchestrated by immersive theatre company Punchdrunk that takes place between them. Barrett says: “It’s been a long-held ambition of mine to create a story that would begin on TV, transfer into a live experience, then fold back into TV. We wanted to break the fourth wall of television.” The original plan for Autumn was an immersive theatre experience on Osea Island that viewers could attend in person, but due to Covid-19 it has been turned into a filmed, as-live broadcast.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/welcome-to-osea-island/2020/sep/16/the-third-day-everything-you-need-to-know-about-skys-new-miniseries">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From comedy to drama, Dennis Kelly’s CV is as colourful as it gets. With his latest outing available now on Sky, TV critic Abigail Chandler reflects on a successful career spent breaking the mould</p><p>Let’s talk about range. Few writers can jump from hilarious female-led comedy to dark conspiracy theory drama, and then move on to a glorious Roald Dahl musical. Dennis Kelly can. Now, the writer behind Utopia and Pulling is back with The Third Day, an unclassifiable drama/mystery/horror starring Jude Law. “I never really understand genre, it’s confusing”, Kelly says, which may go some way towards explaining his eclectic CV. He is interested more in telling a good story than in what form or genre that story takes.</p><p>The Third Day is an atmospheric, disorienting tale split into three distinct but interlinked parts. Summer, led by Law; Winter, led by Naomie Harris; and Autumn, a one-off as-live theatrical broadcast on Sky Arts (Saturday 3 October), masterminded by theatre icons Punchdrunk. As the show’s co-creator, Punchdrunk founder Felix Barrett had the ideal creative partner in Kelly. “He was the perfect match. Because he’s a theatre playwright as well, we have that common language,” says Barrett.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/welcome-to-osea-island/2020/sep/16/i-never-really-understand-genre-the-writer-of-the-third-day-on-why-he-refuses-to-define-his-new-series">Continue reading...</a>

For the 5,000 years it’s been occupied, this bucolic 160-hectare (400-acre) island has been blanketed in secrecy, hosting everything from Viking burial grounds and classified military bases to scandalous rehab centres and, now, luxury holidaymakers and party animals.</p><p>The island’s chequered past makes it fertile grounds for storytelling; it’s beguiling nature is exactly what Dennis Kelly and Felix Barrett were looking for when they set out to create their groundbreaking new Sky psychological thriller, The Third Day. Starring Jude Law, Naomie Harris, Katherine Waterston and Emily Watson, the show tells the individual but interconnected tales of Sam (Law) and Helen (Harris), both of whom journey to the island at different times and become engulfed in its secrets as they attempt to unlock the truth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/welcome-to-osea-island/2020/sep/16/like-a-mystical-world-welcome-to-osea-the-enigmatic-home-of-skys-the-third-day">Continue reading...</a>

As a quiet, earnest Catholic school kid – the kind that excitedly whispers “I’m clean!” to themselves after their first confession – it’s not all that surprising that I eventually got bullied. The boys called me names, pushed me into lockers, and dug their pens and markers into my clothes, as if to tell the rest of the pack: “He will let you do this!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/16/black-sabbath-paranoid-at-50-potent-anthems-of-working-class-strife">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This update of the classic biscuit marries its lovely, crumbly texture and fruity chew with lingering aniseed sweetness and satisfying crunch</p><p>The garibaldi biscuit was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2000/feb/10/features11.g21">first made in Bermondsey, south London, by Peek Freans</a>, a tea company. It was similar to traditional biscuits at the time – dry, square and ideal for sustenance on long journeys. Maybe this is why I find it perfect for both a long bike ride and to complement a good cup of tea. It is a simple biscuit with a lovely crumbly texture and fruity chew. Traditionally, the garibaldi biscuit features currants, but adding barberries gives a tangy edge, while fennel seeds bring a lingering aniseed sweetness and toasted hazelnuts offer a satisfying crunch.</p><p><em><strong>Makes 14</strong></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/sep/16/david-athertons-recipe-for-barberry-fennel-and-hazelnut-garibaldis">Continue reading...</a>

A bright pillar of rocket combustion slices through the crisp blue of an unusually cold morning, then splits, forking outward. Like the thousands watching on the ground miles away at the Kennedy Space Center, the shaky cameraman at first can’t understand what he’s seeing – “Is that trouble, or not?” he asks.

<p>The world has been strikingly kind to the ex-Avenger after he accidentally shared a photo of his penis with the rest of the universe </p><p>So now we know why Captain America travelled back in time at the end of Avengers: Endgame. It wasn’t so that he could go and experience small-scale contentment with the love of his life. No, it was because it was much, much harder to accidentally Instagram a picture of your penis in the 1940s.</p><p>Unfortunately, Captain America actor Chris Evans had to continue living in the present, where this is apparently all too easy a mistake to make. The abbreviated version of the story is this: Evans was on Instagram, sharing a screen recording of a game of Heads Up that he had played with members of his family. The video ended and automatically cut to a shot of his phone’s camera roll. The roll contained one photo of a penis and another of Evans’ face superimposed with the text: “Guard that pussy.” The post was instantly deleted, but not quickly enough to prevent screenshots from circulating.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/16/guard-that-property-our-reaction-to-chris-evans-nudes-reveals-the-remarkable-power-of-captain-america">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having polarised pop with the abrasive PC Music, he’s now going solo. ‘I trust my own dislike of things’, he says</p><p>Describing AG Cook’s haircut is a challenge. Part mullet, part moptop, it also features elements of shag, perm and bowl. The more I try to place it the context of hair history (Paul McCartney? Joan Jett? Late-80s Deirdre Barlow?) the more disorientated I become. It is not the only thing about him that is liable to confound. Cook, 30, from London, is the man behind PC Music, the record label whose sickly, abrasive and ultra-synthetic output doubled as the most divisive sound of the decade.</p><p>Yet, in typically contrarian style, the lead single for Cook’s new solo album, Apple, sounds completely different. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koI7IRSjfxc">Oh Yeah</a> is a catchy guitar ballad pumped full of brain-tickling nostalgia for late-90s pop-rock. Much like his hairstyle, it evades all my attempts to find any close relatives (Natalie Imbruglia? Deep Blue Something? Hanson?). According to Cook, his main influence was actually Shania Twain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/16/ag-cook-the-nutty-producer-behind-the-decades-most-divisive-music">Continue reading...</a>

I have a job I love, in the specialty I love, and it probably all looks too good to be true. That’s because it is. My career in psychiatry actually started on the other side, as a psychiatric inpatient going through multiple admissions, medications and courses of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). When I was first admitted to a psychiatric hospital, I stepped from one world into quite another – even though I was in the same long, grey building where I had been a medical student.</p><p>I was 26, training to be a GP, and I didn’t think I would ever work as a doctor again. I wanted to become a psychiatrist, but felt certain that was now closed to me. I experienced burning envy of psychiatrists I met as a patient. They wore their roles easily, carelessly, as I believed I never would.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/16/mental-illness-doctor-psychiatrist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>London Broncos are not nearly as popular as Fulham were in 1980 but their longevity should be applauded</p><p>By <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-willacy">Gavin Willacy</a> for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook">No Helmets Required</a></p><p>London Broncos are celebrating their 40th birthday this week, making them old enough for a mid-life crisis. If truth be told, the club has never been far from crises, but they are still here and that deserves celebrating. London’s only full-time professional rugby league club has experienced most of the future-on-a-knife-edge moments now threatening the existence of their 21st century counterparts, Toronto Wolfpack. Created by wealthy people in an exciting city with little rugby league history and only a few dozen amateur participants, the Wolfpack should have learned plenty from the Broncos’ story.</p><p>In 1980, Warrington director Harold Genders, a former Rochdale and Widnes scrum-half, was dismayed by the lack of coverage of the Challenge Cup final in the London media. He managed to convince Fulham FC chairman Ernie Clay that he could have a team competing in rugby league’s top division for just £500,000. With the Cottagers struggling on and off the football pitch, Clay bit. Genders resigned from the Warrington board to become managing director of Fulham Rugby League Club.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2020/sep/16/celebrating-40-years-professional-rugby-league-london-broncos-fulham-toronto-wolfpack">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Continuing our series of writers recommending hidden films to stream is a call to watch a stylish 1969 B-movie about figure eight racing</p><p>“There’s a suicide born every minute,” quips cynical sports promoter Grant Willard (Brian Donlevy), as he watches figure eight racing drivers dropping – or rather, flipping – like flies. Indeed, the race, with its entropic intersection, seems like utter lunacy at first glance – a one-way ticket to crumpled steel and fatal injury. Yet there’s something uniquely seductive, even irresistible, about the spectacle: the mesmerising rhythm of crashes and crossovers; the music of purring engines and screeching tyres; the way the dust from the track, intermingled with wispy exhaust fumes, catches the glow of the floodlights; and of course, the aggressively masculine bravado of the winner.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/11/catfight-streaming-anne-heche-sandra-oh-netflix">My streaming gem: why you should watch Catfight</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/16/my-streaming-gem-why-you-should-watch-pit-stop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hawking’s collaborator retells his story with humour and fondness, and helps us know the famous scientist as he really was</p><p>We all feel we know the story of Stephen Hawking: his undergraduate years at Oxford; the shocking diagnosis of motor neurone disease when he was 21 and the slow decline of his physical body for half a century; his two marriages; his research into the nature of black holes that established him as one of the most brilliant scientists of his generation; and of course the publication of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/07/100-best-nonfiction-books-6-brief-history-of-time-stephen-hawking">A Brief History of Time</a></em>, which turned him into an icon, the genius in the wheelchair. A number of biographies already exist, and there is a memoir entitled, inevitably, <em>My Brief History</em>, as well as the biopic, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/01/the-theory-of-everything-review-stephen-hawking-biopic-gravity">The Theory of Everything</a></em>, in which Hawking is played by Eddie Redmayne<em>.</em> But this latest, highly enjoyable, book is different.</p><p>What is refreshing is the absence of the usual adulation of an exceptional mind and celebration of triumph over adversity. In their place is a tender account, full of genuine affection, which doesn’t shy away from Hawking’s intense focus, self-centredness, unpredictability and the difficulties faced by his wives and carers. The author, Leonard Mlodinow, is in an almost unique position. A fellow physicist and science writer, he worked closely with Hawking over many years during which they co-wrote two bestselling books: <em>A Briefer History of Time</em> and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/18/questions-life-cosmology-stephen-hawking?showallcomments=true">The Grand Design</a></em>, the collaboration on and writing of which forms the backdrop for this memoir.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/16/stephen-hawking-by-leonard-mlodinow-review-a-memoir-of-friendship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kim Kardashian West, Jameela Jamil and Chrissy Teigen are having a three-way altercation about control pants and pregnancy</p><p>What happened? I thought the pandemic had prompted a collective realisation that uncomfortable clothes are not to be tolerated. I thought we were all going to burn our skinny jeans and emerge from lockdown in loungewear. Alas, it seems that, instead of embracing baggy bliss, some pregnant people are squeezing themselves into the modern equivalent of corsets.</p><p>If there is a feminist-adjacent argument online, the odds are high that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian">Kim Kardashian West</a>, Jameela Jamil or Chrissy Teigen will be at the centre of it. This particular incident stars all three. To cut a long and tedious story short, Kardashian West jumped into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2019/nov/27/many-spanx-how-did-shapewear-become-a-political-battleground">growing market</a> for “shapewear” – control pants that squish your squidgy bits – last year. This caused a ruckus when it happened because she named her brand “Kimono”, but, after lots of outrage and free PR, she renamed it Skims. Now the enterprising Kardashian West has come out with a line of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFCtwI-FcD6/?utm_source=ig_embed">Maternity Solutionwear</a>. Jamil, an actor who has built a brand on getting offended by Kardashian shenanigans, immediately started bemoaning the conversation around pregnancy shapewear, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFFgAIPjrk7/">noting</a> that she wished we could focus “on the inside of a pregnant body, not the outside”. At which point Teigen, who is expecting a third child, jumped in to say that, actually, pregnancy shapewear isn’t about looking small, but about <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/benhenry/kim-kardashian-skims-maternity-solutionwear">support and pain relief</a>. Kardashian West then explained: “Skims maternity line is not to slim, but to support.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/16/coronavirus-has-left-most-of-us-embracing-baggy-bliss-so-why-are-celebrities-arguing-over-shapewear">Continue reading...</a>

Her mother died last autumn, and a few months later she contracted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19</a> along with a secondary infection that turned out to be pneumonia. It might have killed her had it not been for a swift diagnosis. “That doctor saved my life,” she says.</p><p>Coronavirus left her holed up at home for several weeks, on her own and only opening the front door to gulp in the fresh air. Yet in the maelstrom of grief, illness and social isolation, she managed to write a book, published this month. Remember Me? is a memoir about her mother, Asha Gulati, an indomitable, Southport-born woman who was diagnosed with dementia in 2017. Gulati became her live-in carer at their Manchester family home, juggling life as an actor, dancer and TV presenter with the daily unpredictability of that care.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/16/shobna-gulati-covid-19-queen-thatcher-virgin-mary-on-radio-dinnerladies-corrie">Continue reading...</a>
