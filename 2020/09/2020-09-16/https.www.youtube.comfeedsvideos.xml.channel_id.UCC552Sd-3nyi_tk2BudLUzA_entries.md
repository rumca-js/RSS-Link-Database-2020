WHEN will you get a COVID-19 vaccine?

With the news of Pfizer having a COVID-19 vaccine with 90% effectiveness, does this mean we will be getting a vaccine soon? It is important to be optimistic, and there are other companies like BioNtech which are making incredible progress as well. I mean, Trump claimed during the presidential debates that a vaccine would be completed "within a few weeks". This is not possible based on vaccine trials, the need for more glass vials and the epidemiological aspects of administering a vaccine. Scientists and experts do not expect a vaccine for months to a year, and that has not changed. In fact, the complex biochemistry of the COVID-19 vaccine means some of the phase 4 trials require booster shots, may not create an immunity that lasts and are no where near being administered country or worldwide within the next potential YEAR!? Now that Trump and Melania have tested positive for COVID-19, I'm sure he is wishing he spoke more accurately about the science of COVID-19.
