Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | September 14, 2020\nDeclan McKenna and his band rock their Tiny Desk (home) concert. Their \"home,\" in this case, is The Foundry, a neighboring studio in North London. Declan is decked out with glitter, channeling a more flamboyant side of rock than I've seen from him before. He's still immersed in complex storytelling with characters on the fringes, alienated for reasons of class and politics.\n\nThree of the songs are from Zeros, his brand new album recorded in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce. It's been a wild three-year ride since the release of his teenage smash debut What Do You Think About the Car? He's now 21 and leads a fiery, honed band that developed serious chops after a few years of touring; Isabel Torres (guitar), Nathan Cox (keyboards), William Bishop (bass), and Gabrielle Marie King (drums) all propel the songs of Declan McKenna.\n\nFor his Tiny Desk (home) concert finale, Declan performs his best-known song, \"Brazil,\" a tune steeped in politics and sports, and the enthusiasm has him atop a tiny desk in the end.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Daniel, You're Still a Child\"\n\"The Key to Life on Earth\"\n\"Beautiful Faces\"\n\"Brazil\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDeclan McKenna: vocals, guitar, keyboard; Isabel Torres: guitar; Nathan Cox: keyboards; William Bishop: bass; Gabrielle Marie King: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo by: Ollie Shasha; Audio by: Rollo Smallcombe ; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FblAep81Cc", "date_published": "2020-09-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Basia Bulat: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert From The Archives", "description": "We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Basia Bulat\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2011/01/24/133113463/basia-bulat-tiny-desk-concert\n\nStephen Thompson | January 24, 2011\nA sweetly engaging folk-pop singer from Ontario, Basia Bulat first won me over with a brisk, charming single called \"In the Night,\" which finds her deploying an autoharp in lieu of the standard-issue guitar. When playing the song live, it looks as if Bulat is singing while burping a stringed infant. But when she turned up at the NPR Music offices last September, she'd brought everything except her autoharp: She came with her full band (Holly Coish on ukulele, Allison Stewart on viola, her brother Bobby Bulat on percussion and Ben Whiteley on bass), as well as her own guitar and a hammered, zither-like instrument called a pianoette.\n\nOn request, with the aid of an acoustic guitar, Bulat made a game run through \"In the Night\" to close this Tiny Desk Concert. But that marvelous ringer is far from the only highlight here: After opening with \"The Shore\" \u2014 performed on the aforementioned pianoette \u2014 Bulat salutes her Polish heritage by performing an old song called \"W Zielonym Zoo,\" which roughly translates as \"In the Green Zoo.\" And, while the selection that follows (\"Heart of My Own\") is considerably easier to follow, Bulat does plenty in these 15 minutes to showcase her considerable range. Along the way, she never loses an ounce of the good-natured charm that led us to invite her to the Tiny Desk in the first place.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Shore\"\n\"W Zielonym Zoo (In The Green Zoo)\"\n\"Heart Of My Own\"\n\"In The Night\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh-FnjWFTJQ", "date_published": "2020-09-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
