Immune boosting

You should consider 2 vitamins

Takes vitamin C and D, lessen your susceptibility to infection

If you are deficient in vitamin D that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection, so I would not mind recommending, and I do it myself, vitamin D supplement

Gram or 2 of vitamin C, antioxidant

Herbs, not recommended, if you want to use them fine

Other concoctions I would not do

Flu shots

Everyone 6 months or older should get a flu shot

Immunity may wear off, gets this flu shot middle / end October

Most flu starts middle to end of November
