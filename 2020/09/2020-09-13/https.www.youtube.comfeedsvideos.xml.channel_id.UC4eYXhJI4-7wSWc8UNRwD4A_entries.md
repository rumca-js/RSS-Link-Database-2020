The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Declan McKenna and his band rock their Tiny Desk (home) concert. Their "home," in this case, is The Foundry, a neighboring studio in North London. Declan is decked out with glitter, channeling a more flamboyant side of rock than I've seen from him before. He's still immersed in complex storytelling with characters on the fringes, alienated for reasons of class and politics.

Three of the songs are from Zeros, his brand new album recorded in Nashville with producer Jay Joyce. It's been a wild three-year ride since the release of his teenage smash debut What Do You Think About the Car? He's now 21 and leads a fiery, honed band that developed serious chops after a few years of touring; Isabel Torres (guitar), Nathan Cox (keyboards), William Bishop (bass), and Gabrielle Marie King (drums) all propel the songs of Declan McKenna.

For his Tiny Desk (home) concert finale, Declan performs his best-known song, "Brazil," a tune steeped in politics and sports, and the enthusiasm has him atop a tiny desk in the end.

SET LIST
"Daniel, You're Still a Child"
"The Key to Life on Earth"
"Beautiful Faces"
"Brazil"

We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Stephen Thompson | January 24, 2011
A sweetly engaging folk-pop singer from Ontario, Basia Bulat first won me over with a brisk, charming single called "In the Night," which finds her deploying an autoharp in lieu of the standard-issue guitar. When playing the song live, it looks as if Bulat is singing while burping a stringed infant. But when she turned up at the NPR Music offices last September, she'd brought everything except her autoharp: She came with her full band (Holly Coish on ukulele, Allison Stewart on viola, her brother Bobby Bulat on percussion and Ben Whiteley on bass), as well as her own guitar and a hammered, zither-like instrument called a pianoette.

On request, with the aid of an acoustic guitar, Bulat made a game run through "In the Night" to close this Tiny Desk Concert. But that marvelous ringer is far from the only highlight here: After opening with "The Shore" — performed on the aforementioned pianoette — Bulat salutes her Polish heritage by performing an old song called "W Zielonym Zoo," which roughly translates as "In the Green Zoo." And, while the selection that follows ("Heart of My Own") is considerably easier to follow, Bulat does plenty in these 15 minutes to showcase her considerable range. Along the way, she never loses an ounce of the good-natured charm that led us to invite her to the Tiny Desk in the first place.

SET LIST
"The Shore"
"W Zielonym Zoo (In The Green Zoo)"
"Heart Of My Own"
"In The Night"
