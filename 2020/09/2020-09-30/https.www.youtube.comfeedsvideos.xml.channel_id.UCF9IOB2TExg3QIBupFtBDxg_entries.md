Correcting Britain's Vitamin D deficiency could save thousands of lives (David Davis MP, Matt Ridley)

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/26/correcting-britains-vitamin-d-deficiency-could-save-thousands/

There is one chemical that:

is known to be safe

known to be needed by many people anyway

known to have a clinically proven track record of helping people fight off 
respiratory diseases

is so cheap no big firm is pushing it

vitamin D

Vitamin D Levels Appear to Play Role in COVID-19 Mortality Rates

https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2020/05/vitamin-d-levels-appear-to-play-role-in-covid-19-mortality-rates.html

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058578v4

China, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States.

Patients with severe deficiency are twice as likely to experience major complications

Spanish clinical trial

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/

Calcifediol group, 2% required admission to the ICU

Control group 50% admitted to ICU

Put another way, the use of Vitamin D reduced a patient’s risk of needing intensive care 25-fold

The Government should now act on this latest evidence

We have good reason to think vitamin D supplementation will help reduce mortality from Covid-19

we know it can reduce the incidence and severity of the other acute respiratory illnesses

pressures from influenza during the winter months

This will no doubt save thousands of lives in any second wave

There is now no reason not to act

Covid-19: Do many people have pre-existing immunity? (21 September 2020, Eshani M King, BMJ)

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563/rr-6

Many have T cells that act against SARS-CoV-2 epitopes

Killing intracellular parasites

Critical in viral immunity

T cell response might be more important that B cell response

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pai.13263

B‐cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease

Vaccines focused on antibody levels

Mild or asymptomatic cases, many T-cells are produced

In these mild cases, few or no detectable antibodies

Men produced fewer T-cells than women

Older men produce less T cells than younger men

Vitamin D controls T cell antigen receptor signaling and activation of human T cells, (University of Copenhagen)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20208539/

Vitamin D essential to facilitate maturation of naïve T cells to dedicated, specific T cells

When a T cell is exposed to a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor, with which it searches for vitamin D

If there is an inadequate vitamin D level,

they won't even begin to mobilize

To convert ng/ml of 25(OH)D to nmol/l the conversion factor is 2.5.

20ng/ml enough to prevent rickets, osteoporosis and osteomalacia

40-60ng/ml or more is required to achieve optimum immune system and cancer fighting capability

30 ng/ml being sufficient but not optimal

Correction, Number of infections in India is proabably 9, 620,000, not 60, million as written. However the IFR calculation is still valid as this is based on the number of reported deaths, compared to the overall population. This means the US is likly to have a higher overall number of infections, compared to India.

Recent Increase in COVID-19 Cases Reported Among Adults Aged 18–22 Years — United States, May 31–September 5, 2020

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e4.htm?s—cid=mm6939e4—w


Young adults with COVID-19 can spread infection to their contacts and communities.

August 2–September 5

Weekly cases, 18–22 years

Increased 55% nationally

Northeast (144%)

Midwest (123%)

Increases in cases not attributable to increased testing.

Therefore

Young adults, also in colleges and universities

Should take precautions

Mask wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene, and follow local, state, and federal guidance

Institutions of higher education should take action to promote healthy environments


Multiple COVID-19 Clusters on a University Campus — North Carolina, August 2020

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6939e3.htm?s_cid=mm6939e3_w

A North Carolina university

Rapid increase in cases and clusters within 2 weeks of opening

August 3–25

670 laboratory-confirmed cases

96% were among patients aged less than 22 years

Eighteen clusters of five or more epidemiologically linked cases

All within 14 days of one another

Student gatherings and congregate living settings

Both on and off campus contributed

Therefore 

Enhanced measures are needed to reduce transmission at institutes of higher education

Reducing on-campus housing density

Ensuring adherence to masking and other mitigation strategies

Increasing testing

Discouraging student gatherings.
