## Andrew Marr: 'There is a drive on to destroy the BBC'

<p>The veteran political interviewer on how his stroke has changed him, interviewing Boris Johnson and what he thinks of the rumours Charles Moore could be the corporation’s new chairman</p><p><br />Andrew Marr is reading a new book by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams – research for his Monday-morning radio show <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9xr">Start the Week</a> – and about to eat a bacon roll when I arrive at the cafe near his home in Primrose Hill, north London. The photographer, an honourable man, has promised he will not do an Ed Miliband on Marr, who in any case eats his roll with great decorum. The cafe is <a href="https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/helena-bonham-carter-opens-primrose-hill-cafe-1-6806473">part-owned</a> by the writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewohagan">Andrew O’Hagan</a>, and its walls are decorated with framed covers of the London Review of Books. A few doors away is the house in which WB Yeats lived – a blue plaque commemorates the fact – and Sylvia Plath died. The book-loving Marr lives in the rarefied heart of literary London. Political journalism may be his profession, but art and literature are his life.</p><p>We are meeting to discuss his new book, Elizabethans, although the debate swirling around the future of the BBC in the face of a hostile government is never far from our minds. He describes Elizabethans as an “attitudinal history” of the past 70 years, told through the eyes of 60-plus individuals he has selected as exemplars of the age. Many of his subjects are unexpected: the actor Diana Dors, twinned with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/ruth-ellis-files-bbc-documentary-murder-case-cant-let-go">Ruth Ellis</a>, the last woman to be hanged in Britain, with whom Dors appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Godiva_Rides_Again">a film</a>; the union activist Jimmy Reid; the Monty Python comic Graham Chapman; the anti-permissive society campaigner Mary Whitehouse (who gets surprisingly sympathetic treatment), and the rightwing Tory politician Enoch Powell (ditto). It is rather like The Crown in book form: a stream of intriguing stories producing a mosaic that the reader, with expert steers from Marr, can glue together. There will eventually be a three-part TV series based on the book, but it seems to be stuck in the scheduling works at present.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/30/andrew-marr-there-is-a-drive-on-to-destroy-the-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I was about to shoot Alex Morgan, captain of the USA team, celebrating – when Kelley O’Hara flew in, fists clenched and ponytail up in the air’<br /></p><p>The key to a great sports shot is timing … and a lot of luck. There might be an amazing shot about to happen and then a player or an official steps in front of you. One time I was shooting a game where there were seven goals scored – but six of them happened at the other end of the pitch! One player alone scored four and I didn’t have anything of it because I was at the opposite end.</p><p>For this shot, it all came together. It was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/womens-world-cup-2019">2019 Women’s World Cup</a> and the USA were about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2019/jun/28/usa-france-womens-world-cup-quarter-final-live-score">to win</a> their quarter-final against the hosts, France, at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Once we hit the 90-minute mark I followed the USA team’s captain, Alex Morgan, around the pitch with my lens, hoping she’d do something. During stoppage time she had moved away from me and I was worried she’d be too far off. I had a backup plan to photograph the bench instead, because the substitutes and staff often come running on to the pitch at the final whistle, but luckily the play came back towards my end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/30/jubilation-womens-world-cup-rob-cianflones-best-photograph-alex-morgan-kelley-ohara">Continue reading...</a>

I learned the whole vocabulary.” His fellow pupils, however, did not yet have the words to describe Gupta. “They had never heard of India. My ‘baggage’ was useless.”</p><p>He also recalls his first boyfriend. “This American boy: blond hair, blue-eyed, Irish, from Wisconsin.” He didn’t know much about Indians, says Gupta, “but he was very knowledgeable about the streets.” Again, Gupta hadn’t the terminology for what they did together. “I’d been very sexually active since as far back as I can remember,” he explains. “In large Indian families, there is a very strict formality on the surface, but underneath everything goes. There were boys in the neighbourhood, but it didn’t have a name. Besides, my future was laid out: at the right age, your mum and dad found you a spouse.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/sep/30/saunas-sex-clubs-street-fights-sunil-gupta-global-gay-life-miss-uk">Continue reading...</a>

Now she is on the other side of Washington DC, as the struggling single parent turned education reform activist Virginia Walden.</p><p>In early scenes, Virginia drags her weary frame through school metal detectors to urgent parent-teacher conferences about her 15-year-old son. Then it’s on to meetings with the bank to plead for loans to pay for private school and her second job cleaning toilets at a congresswoman’s office. On the horizon, the Capitol dome gleams, contrasting with crumbling, graffitied buildings of Walden’s neighbourhood, a simplistic shorthand for DC’s notorious inequalities. The cliched choreography of a school-bully fight scene – they round on the class nerd and trample his glasses – is also typical of this film’s surface-skimming depiction of social problems.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/30/miss-virginia-review-uzo-aduba">Continue reading...</a>

That’s how long I spent on dating apps before I met my partner (yes, on a dating app), so I’ve had more than my fair share of “heys”. There is one particularly epic week that still lives in infamy among my friends, when I got 13 consecutive “heys” from 13 consecutive matches. And – as appealing as a “hey” is from someone you might want to spend the rest of your life with – you’ll be unsurprised to hear I didn’t respond to a single one.</p><p>Now, research from dating app Inner Circle has confirmed what we all suspected; “hey” as a conversational opener is officially dead. The dating app surveyed more than 1,000 single people, who universally slammed it as lazy. Also: “unimaginative”, “unmemorable” and “boring”. In fact, one-word openers – despite 91% of us having received them and more than 90% of users saying the first message is important – have only a <a href="https://www.globaldatinginsights.com/news/inner-circle-stops-users-from-sending-unimaginative-opening-lines/" rel="nofollow">12% response rate</a>. Inner Circle is so over the word that it has just introduced a new messaging feature that will autocorrect your “hey” to something more imaginative. So if you actually want to meet someone you match with and could spend a considerable amount of time with, here are 10 way, way better conversations starters …</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/up-your-dating-game/2020/sep/30/whats-your-favourite-pasta-shape-10-successful-dating-app-conversation-starters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cycling has never really been Andrzej Lukowski’s ‘thing’.

I grew up next to a busy main road, and my mum’s continual fretting rubbed off: I have a lifelong suspicion of the ol’ two wheels and I was grateful that, after the age of 11, not riding seemed entirely socially acceptable.</p><p>Recently, though, I have been having second thoughts. For starters, I’ve been teaching my five-year-old to ride a bike, and I’m concerned I lack credibility on the subject. More seriously, the positive arguments for riding a bike seem increasingly compelling. I <em>do</em> want to do something good for the environment. I <em>don’t</em> want to get Covid on the train in the morning. I feel like I <em>should</em> do some sort of regular exercise, but I absolutely <em>don’t</em> want to go to the gym.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/ride-a-marathon/2020/sep/30/im-running-out-of-reasons-not-to-cycle-why-im-ready-to-conquer-my-fears-and-get-in-the-saddle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jools Walker first fell in love with cycling courtesy of a hand-me-down BMX, but it wasn’t until she purchased her first set of two wheels as an adult that it was reignited</p><p>Some of my happiest childhood memories are on my BMX Burner, the bike I inherited as a seven-year-old from my big sister. It wasn’t new or flashy like other kids’ bikes at school, nor was it the bike that I secretly desired, but that didn’t matter. That red and yellow beauty sparked friendships – and an obsession with life on two wheels.</p><p>After school and on weekends, I’d meet up with my friends, a mix of kids from my class and new friends I’d made cycling around my housing estate. Our favourite time for bike adventures was the summer holidays: six glorious weeks of long, bright days, with no school to interrupt our time. Parks, other housing estates and even building sites (definitely a place where you need reliable tyres) became our adventure playgrounds to explore.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/ride-a-marathon/2020/sep/30/i-cant-stress-enough-how-empowering-it-is-how-riding-a-bmx-burner-changed-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Bridge theatre, London</strong><br />There are fine performances by Imelda Staunton and Lucian Msamati in this pair of Talking Heads</p><p>The latest two live instalments of <a href="https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on-talking-heads-live/">Alan Bennett</a><a href="https://bridgetheatre.co.uk/whats-on-talking-heads-live/">’s Talking Heads series</a>, featuring actors who recently remade them for television, are miniature character studies in crime and punishment. Early references to imprisonment signpost the fate that awaits the flawed, fallen figures in these monologues, and though they never express any outright guilt, Bennett leaves us feeling an uneasy compassion for them both.</p><p>Neither of these dramas, originally presented on TV in 1988 and 1998, has lost its quiet shocks though both come laden with cultural anachronisms and outdated news stories about community policing and prison life. Wilfred, in Playing Sandwiches, is a seemingly unassuming park attendant who befriends “kiddies” and hints of a paedophilic past. The story reaches a critical point when a stranger leaves her daughter in his care. Irene, in Lady of Letters, is less amicable, shooting off letters of complaint to her local council, MP and the Queen, while her anger takes increasingly savage turns.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/sep/30/playing-sandwiches-and-lady-of-letters-review-alan-bennett-talking-heads">Continue reading...</a>

My favourite sub is stuffed with cured fish, pickles and fresh, crispy lettuce. For this, you want a pillowy, soft roll that can stand up to the strong flavours. The grated, pickled beetroot here keeps the crumb moist and gives it a slightly sour taste and a pretty pink colour. The flaxseed meal and the wholemeal flour feed your gut microbiome without making the bread dense.

<p>From Homer’s classical epic to Kae Tempest’s mythic struggles in modern London, these books show that poetry can be more immediate than prose<br /></p><p>Verse novels have been with us for millennia, yet when you publish one, many are surprised by your breach of the prose-novel tradition and also somewhat fearful of trying something new.</p><p>It is curious how we love poems as children, and as adults drag them out for weddings and funerals – and yet in our day-to-day lives feel poetry doesn’t belong to us. When I speak at events the overwhelming refrain from my audiences is that poetry is difficult and makes readers feel ignorant. But the verse novel, well that’s something slightly different. As a poet I write with melody in mind, but as a novelist, story is king, so if showing off with language will muddy my reader’s ability to engage with the characters, I scratch it out and try again, and most verse novelists I read do the same.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/30/top-10-verse-novels-sarah-crossan-homer-kae-tempest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Now enjoying a new lease of life on Netflix, the mother-daughter dramedy still holds a special place in fans’ hearts</p><p>At 22, I experienced a moderate bout of depression. Living in a packed house I shared with strangers and having just ended a draining relationship, I was in a weird, transitional period, and I was finding it a bit much. I worked mornings, which at least meant my days began with structure and a sense of purpose. My afternoons, by contrast, were lonely and aimless, defined by hours-long naps and eating large bags of crisps. There was, however, one other, nicer, constant, something I always looked forward to, no matter how grey I felt.

<p>Donald Trump refuses to denounce white supremacist violence as candidates throw insults and tempers flare</p><p>The first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden deteriorated into an ugly display of contempt on Tuesday night, as the president relentlessly interrupted and attacked his Democratic rival during clashes over the coronavirus pandemic, race, the economy and the future of the supreme court.</p><p>Over the course of an extraordinarily combative and chaotic 90-minute performance, a fitting coda to what has been one of the nastiest presidential campaigns in recent memory, Trump interjected so frequently that Biden at one point lost his patience and snapped: “Will you shut up, man?

<p>The most poetic musician who ever lived? It’s hard to disagree with Liszt’s appraisal of Schubert, who, in his short life, used his astonishing gift for melodic and harmonic invention to create many enduring masterpieces</p><p>He composed more than 600 songs – taking the art of writing German Lieder to a new plane – as well as seven completed symphonies, chamber music and piano sonatas. Yet there’s a sense that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/franz-schubert">Franz Schubert</a> (1797-1828) was still just beginning to exploit his immense gifts and to develop further the musical language he had inherited from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/01/know-the-score-beethoven-where-to-start-with-his-music-250th-anniversary">Beethoven</a>, which he combined with an astonishing gift for melodic and harmonic invention. Schubert was never a great performer, and he was always a freelance composer, relying on what he could earn from commissions and fees. Only a fraction of his music was published in his lifetime, and it was only after his death that the greatness of his achievement was recognised internationally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/sep/30/schubert-where-to-start-with-his-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At some point in my adult life, art had become a thing for people who were already good at art. But during the lockdown, I rediscovered collaging</p><p>In March came the quarantine. Homebound under the governor’s orders, my only escape was an Apple orchard of electronics – MacBook. iPhone. iPad. – my world flattened to screens. I was now a college professor whose domain had shrunken from a classroom to a Zoom URL, students admiring the lush wall of plants in my living room. As a single-unwed-childless-petless woman with no roommates, I found my social life relocated fully to social media.</p><p>By April, my digital ennui ran deep, but I could find no suitable tech-free distraction to float through the hours confined at home. I made daily attempts at improving my read-to-unread book ratio, but my anxious mind insisted on drifting from the page. Often, my attention broke mid-paragraph and I’d be back online checking for breaking news of a Covid cure that wasn’t coming anytime soon, or peering at posts made by friends I used to spend quality time with IRL.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/sep/30/collage-coronavirus-pandemic-hobby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The procedure has gotten a makeover thanks to fertility startups, but some doctors are pushing back on efforts to appeal to younger women</p><p>When Valerie Landis underwent her first round of egg freezing in 2015, she was younger than many of the other patients. Landis, a healthcare sales professional, was 33 at the time. Between the pressures of work, which often required traveling internationally for business, and a breakup a few years prior, she was drawn to the idea of buying herself more time to decide if she wanted to become a parent.</p><p>Back then, “the lowest age I heard was 37”, Landis said. “Now there are people as young as 25 are freezing their eggs. The whole landscape has shifted.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/30/egg-freezing-self-care-pregnancy-fertility">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Bundesliga side’s recruitment policy is held up as a model – but they have won only one trophy since 2012 </p><p>The chase begins frighteningly early. Often years in advance and usually when the object is still a child. Jude Bellingham and Gio Reyna were scouted at 14. Erling Braut Haaland first appeared on the radar in 2016, more than three years before he signed. Age-group games are surreptitiously attended. Targets are identified with surgical precision. Next: the charm offensive.</p><p>Introductions are made. Interest is subtly registered with parents and agent. Replica kits and club merchandise start arriving in the post. The prospective player is invited to Germany to watch a game in front of the heaving, haunting roar of the Yellow Wall (pandemic permitting). No gaudy blandishments; no super-yachts; no suitcases full of cash. As the sporting director, Michael Zorc, likes to put it, Borussia Dortmund don’t need to make grand promises to their teenage hopefuls. They just point to the team sheet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/sep/30/borussia-dortmund-where-dreams-are-made-or-a-glorified-feeder-club">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pledges are made to distract and placate us - but at this year’s UN biodiversity summit, public anger cannot be extinguished<br /></p><p>It’s the hope I can’t stand. Every few years, governments gather to make solemn promises about the action they will take to defend the living world, then break them before the ink is dry. Today, at the virtual <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/28/world-leaders-pledge-to-halt-earth-destruction-un-summit">UN summit on biodiversity</a>, they will move themselves to tears with the thought of the grand things they will do, then turn off their computers and sign another mining lease.</p><p>Ten years ago, at the last summit, world leaders made a similar set of “inspirational” promises. <a href="https://www.cbd.int/gbo/gbo5/publication/gbo-5-en.pdf">Analysis</a> published a fortnight ago showed that, of the 20 pledges agreed at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/29/biodiversity-talks-ministers-nagoya-strategy">Nagoya</a> in Japan in 2010, not one has been met. The collapse of wildlife populations and our life-support systems has continued unabated: the world has now lost <a href="https://www.wwf.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-09/LPR20_Full_report.pdf">68% of its wild vertebrates since 1970</a>. It sounds brutal to say that these meetings are a total waste of time. But this is a generous assessment. By creating a false impression of progress, by assuaging fear and fobbing us off, these summits are a means not of accelerating action but thwarting it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/30/johnson-pledges-environment-un-biodiversity-summit">Continue reading...</a>

## Michael Rosen on his Covid-19 coma: ‘It felt like a pre-death, a nothingness’

<p>Earlier this year, the beloved children’s writer spent six weeks on a ventilator with coronavirus. He talks about the magic of the NHS, the mismanagement of the crisis and how his near-death experience has changed him<br /></p><p>“I’m drinking lemon tea,” Michael Rosen says. “Would you like some? It’s what my mother used to call Russian tea, by the way.” And before I am through the kitchen door of his north London home, he has given me a potted history of Russian tea. It is classic Rosen. Rarely does a sentence pass without the much-loved children’s poet and author teaching you something. There are anecdotes within anecdotes, tangents galore and an astonishing frame of reference – from the Palestinian professor Edward Said on “othering” to the former footballer Gordon Strachan on resilience, the poet Benjamin Zephaniah on us all being migrants and the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud, on memory banks – and back again. “Sorry to inflict the Arsenal mug on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/18/man-city-spurs-football-art">a Man City fan</a>,” he says with a wicked smile. Rosen, it seems, knows everything about everybody.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/06/michael-rosen-takes-first-steps-as-he-recovers-from-covid-19-coronavirus">the 74-year-old </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/06/michael-rosen-takes-first-steps-as-he-recovers-from-covid-19-coronavirus">contracted Covid-19</a>. He spent seven weeks in intensive care, six of them on a ventilator. His hair is white and thinner (although still pretty lush), he wears a hearing aid because his left ear is buggered, the bags under his eyes are more scrotal than ever, his left eye is fogged over, his voice is underpowered and he struggles with his breathing. Then there is the dizziness, numb toes, increased arthritis and blood clots on his lungs. Having said that, he is doing amazingly well. He is not hobbling around his kitchen, but cantering. He is writing books and newspaper columns, performing on his YouTube channel (run by his son Joe; 86m views), tweeting like billy-o. And yet there is something different about him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/sep/30/michael-rosen-on-his-covid-19-coma-it-felt-like-a-pre-death-a-nothingness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The academic year has started at universities across the UK but far from the promised freshers’ experience, new students are finding themselves forced to isolate and attend classes online </p><p>When the coronavirus outbreak first struck Britain in March, universities scrambled to respond. They moved lectures online, sent students home and cancelled exams. But now at the start of a new academic year and despite a summer to plan, there are chaotic scenes springing up on campuses around the country. </p><p>The Guardian’s Scotland correspondent <strong>Libby Brooks </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> that Scottish universities were first to return and have already seen multiple clusters of cases with thousands of students, many away from home for the first time, now forced to isolate. <strong>Jordan Hunter </strong>is in his 3rd year at the University of Glasgow and editor of its student paper. He tells Anushka that anger levels are rising at both university administrators and the government. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/audio/2020/sep/30/an-inevitable-crisis-how-covid-19-hit-universities">Continue reading...</a>
