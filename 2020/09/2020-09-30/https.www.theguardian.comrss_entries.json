[{"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Andrew Marr: 'There is a drive on to destroy the BBC'", "description": "<p>The veteran political interviewer on how his stroke has changed him, interviewing Boris Johnson and what he thinks of the rumours Charles Moore could be the corporation\u2019s new chairman</p><p><br />Andrew Marr is reading a new book by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams \u2013 research for his Monday-morning radio show <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9xr\">Start the Week</a> \u2013 and about to eat a bacon roll when I arrive at the cafe near his home in Primrose Hill, north London. The photographer, an honourable man, has promised he will not do an Ed Miliband on Marr, who in any case eats his roll with great decorum. The cafe is <a href=\"https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/helena-bonham-carter-opens-primrose-hill-cafe-1-6806473\">part-owned</a> by the writer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/andrewohagan\">Andrew O\u2019Hagan</a>, and its walls are decorated with framed covers of the London Review of Books. A few doors away is the house in which WB Yeats lived \u2013 a blue plaque commemorates the fact \u2013 and Sylvia Plath died. The book-loving Marr lives in the rarefied heart of literary London. Political journalism may be his profession, but art and literature are his life.</p><p>We are meeting to discuss his new book, Elizabethans, although the debate swirling around the future of the BBC in the face of a hostile government is never far from our minds. He describes Elizabethans as an \u201cattitudinal history\u201d of the past 70 years, told through the eyes of 60-plus individuals he has selected as exemplars of the age. Many of his subjects are unexpected: the actor Diana Dors, twinned with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/12/ruth-ellis-files-bbc-documentary-murder-case-cant-let-go\">Ruth Ellis</a>, the last woman to be hanged in Britain, with whom Dors appeared in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Godiva_Rides_Again\">a film</a>; the union activist Jimmy Reid; the Monty Python comic Graham Chapman; the anti-permissive society campaigner Mary Whitehouse (who gets surprisingly sympathetic treatment), and the rightwing Tory politician Enoch Powell (ditto). It is rather like The Crown in book form: a stream of intriguing stories producing a mosaic that the reader, with expert steers from Marr, can glue together. There will eventually be a three-part TV series based on the book, but it seems to be stuck in the scheduling works at present.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/30/andrew-marr-there-is-a-drive-on-to-destroy-the-bbc\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/30/andrew-marr-there-is-a-drive-on-to-destroy-the-bbc", "date_published": "2020-09-30 21:30:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Xi Jinping to address world leaders at UN biodiversity summit \u2013 live", "description": "<p>Leaders prepare to discuss the destruction of the natural world as the international community negotiates a set of targets for the next decade</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/29/all-eyes-on-china-what-to-look-out-for-at-the-un-biodiversity-summit-aoe\">All eyes on China: what to look out for at the UN biodiversity summit</a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-30T15:23:06.907Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>Statements by world leaders and governments have just started with the Guyanese president <strong>Mohamed Irfaan Ali</strong>. </p><p>The president of the 75th UN general assembly, <strong>Volkan Bozk\u0131r</strong>, tells the summit that world leaders have not stuck to the time limits on pre-recorded statements about biodiversity and as such, there won\u2019t be time to play them all. </p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-09-30T15:19:02.518Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>Protecting at least 30% of land and sea is the headline target of the draft Kunming agreement for the next decade\u2019s biodiversity targets.
