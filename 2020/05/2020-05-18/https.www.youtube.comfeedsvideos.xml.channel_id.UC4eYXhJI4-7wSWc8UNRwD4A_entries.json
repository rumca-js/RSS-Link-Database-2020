It\u2019s the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nMay 11, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- Violinists have special relationships with their instruments, almost like marriages. And so it was that when the Grammy-winning fiddler Augustin Hadelich came to play his Tiny Desk concert, he brought with him the equivalent of a new significant other.\n\nUnpacking his beautiful Guarneri del Ges\u00f9, built around 1744, Hadelich admitted that he had played this extraordinary violin for only about a month. But when he began to make music on the instrument, it was clear that these two are perfectly matched. The violin, once owned by the famed virtuoso Henryk Szeryng, has been called one of the finest concert violins in the world.\n\nAnd Hadelich has been called one of the finest concert violinists in the world. Born in Italy to German parents, he studied at Juilliard in New York. His sweep of the top awards at the International Violin Competition of Indianapolis in 2006 launched his career.\n\nWith his discerning pianist Kuang-Hao, Hadelich put the 276-year-old del Ges\u00f9 through its paces in the propulsive \"40% Swing\" from John Adams' Road Movies. He made the instrument croon sweetly in Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's \"Humoresque,\" a chestnut of old world charm, especially in violinist Fritz Kreisler's beloved arrangement. And a burst of energy returned to round out the set with the bustling \"Burlesca,\" by Czech composer Josef Suk, a favorite pupil of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k who later became his son-in-law.\n\nHadelich and his fiddle might still be in that honeymoon period, but for his sake \u2013 and ours \u2013 let's hope they remain the best of friends.\n\nSET LIST\nAdams: Road Movies, III. \"40% Swing\"\nDvo\u0159\u00e1k: Humoresque in G-flat (arr.
