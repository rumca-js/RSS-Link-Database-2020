She\u2019s heard that the virus is most lethal for the elderly, so she\u2019s hopeful about her chances for survival. \u201cBut I\u2019m very scared,\u201d she says.\n\nOnce she\u2019s had the scan, that fear mounts. Cristel begs the nurse pushing her wheelchair to be honest with her about whether the damage to her lungs is serious: \u201cTell me. I\u2019ve got three girls,\u201d she says. \u201cTell me the truth.\u201d\n\nThe nurse can\u2019t answer her. But we watch as Dr. Mangiatordi views the results of Cristel\u2019s scan, her face grim. A fairly widespread area of the young woman\u2019s lung is not functioning.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the test will come back positive,\u201d the doctor says. \u201cShe's 30 years old. Healthy. It\u2019s no longer true that it\u2019s affecting just the elderly.\u201d\n\r\nWatch \"Inside Italy's COVID War\" starting Tues., May 19: https://to.pbs.org/2TgPhDS\n\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\r\n\r\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \r\n\r\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
