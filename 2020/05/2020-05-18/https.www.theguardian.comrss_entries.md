## Ready and preparing to be ready, Matt Hancock pleads for a last chance | John Crace

<p>The health secretary was on the verge of breaking down, his Tiggerish enthusiasm gone</p><p>You can’t fault Matt Hancock’s Stakhanovite work ethic. Barely a day has gone by without him being sent out on to the government frontline. But the effort is clearly beginning to take its toll. In the past few weeks his normal Tiggerish enthusiasm and goodwill to all has given way to something rather more vulnerable. A man who feels himself not just under attack from a country that wonders why the health secretary hasn’t done rather more to protect the nation’s health, but also from the prime minister and cabinet colleagues who have been lining him up as the scapegoat in the inevitable public inquiry.</p><p>The initial sign that Matt was not coping so well was in his snappiness. His tetchiness with MPs and members of the media whenever his version of events was challenged. Now though it’s looking as if Hancock is moving through the denial and anger stages of grief toward the bargaining and depression stages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/18/anosmic-matt-finally-runs-out-of-steam-and-fibs">Continue reading...</a>

Brexit’s strident rhetoric posited falsehoods about migrant workers being behind depressed wages, housing shortages and stressed public services. But that was before coronavirus. Many Britons have woken up now to the fact that vital sectors in the NHS, social care and food production have been kept going by low-paid EU and non-European workers of the kind whose numbers the home secretary, Priti Patel, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52701843" title="">plans</a> to restrict.</p><p>Ms Patel’s immigration bill claims it is introducing a points-based system, but it is more an income-based one. She proposes to end freedom of movement from the EU and apply the same salary threshold and skills requirement to prospective migrants wherever they come from. The rules are due to take effect in January and it is estimated that <a href="https://www.ippr.org/news-and-media/press-releases/immigration-plans-analysis-two-thirds-of-current-eu-migrants-in-health-and-care-sector-would-have-been-found-ineligible" title="">two-thirds</a> of EU migrants now classed as key workers would not qualify for a work visa next year.

I just felt that I had to get to know her. It sounds like a silly fairytale but it’s true.”</p><p>At the time, Tanja was working as a senior field officer for the charity. Andrew got the chance to speak to her properly when they were sent to deliver aid to a home for people with learning disabilities. “Andy was so kind to the people who lived there,” says Tanja. “He was handsome too. All this long, blonde, curly hair. It’s all gone now, of course,” she laughs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/18/how-we-met-i-had-this-surge-of-adrenaline-i-just-had-to-get-to-know-her">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A template or rough guide, rather than a recipe, for this wonderfully versatile, simple Piedmontese green sauce that goes with anything</p><p>If we have been careful through the week, and it is not the tight end of the month, we buy fish on Friday – a whole bream or a bass – then bake it on a bed of potatoes. It is one of my favourite meals to shop for: the long-winded chat with my fishmonger, followed by the sniffing out of bright eyes, red gills and winking scales; the haggle, slap and wrap. It’s also a favourite meal to prepare. While it bakes in the oven, the sound of the skin tightening and the potatoes crisping travels through the oven door. I pour myself another glass and make the the salsa verde – or green sauce.</p><p>I have been making salsa verde for years: garlic, capers, anchovies and herbs that are chopped, pounded or blended until they look like grass cuttings, then loosened with olive oil and sharpened with vinegar. While I was aware of the traditional Piedmontese recipe for <em>bagnet verd</em>, which includes breadcrumbs soaked in vinegar (and conscious that others add egg yolks to theirs), I was, until recently, set in my ways, and usually happy with the outcome, give or take the odd dud. Then one Friday, happy with wine, music and that moment, I added a crustless slice of bread crumbled and sprinkled with red wine vinegar to the green rubble. As you can imagine, the addition of breadcrumbs changes the colour, especially if you are doing it by hand, making it like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=herringbone+twill&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03KY6kUdWhUlg4SbSIHAi6xvm6ZKQ:1588865397796&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=s_AM4MeNYlobxM%253A%252CWDLDeJTZJ3cp5M%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kRwKsU9bEdJGIwGT8X6vTe0_kxROA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwj3m4btiKLpAhWGXxUIHZ84ChAQ9QEwDHoECAEQQg#imgrc=s_AM4MeNYlobxM:">herringbone twill</a>. It also plumps up the consistency, turning it from a grassy, shiny mass to something pudgy, softer. The flavour is also gentler – capers, anchovy and herbs are a forthright, even rude combination, salty and searing – the breadcrumbs soften everything.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/18/rachel-roddy-not-recipe-for-salsa-verde-green-sauce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve sharpened a wide range of skills as a parent – patience, adaptability, multitasking. Potential employers should see the value in it</p><p>By the time I gave birth to my second daughter, her older sister was just 19 months old. At the time, I did research for a small nonprofit and my income barely covered the childcare I’d need to keep doing it. So, like<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/opting-out/500018/"> a lot of mothers</a>, I left my job because it didn’t make financial sense to continue working.</p><p>I didn’t have a problem with the decision. Thanks to my background in public policy, I’m well aware of the economic value of parenting. By fostering a safe, nurturing, and stable environment for my children in their infancy, I am helping to mold the intelligent, creative, hard-working adults society needs. In economic terms, I’m helping to create human capital, which accounts for<a href="https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/29001/9781464810466.pdf"> two-thirds of global wealth</a> and is a key driver of growth in our increasingly high-tech, globalized economy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/feminist-economics-us-women-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His best-loved dishes that make the most of what we have right now: shoulder of lamb, haddock fishcakes, banana tarts with cardamom cream</p><p>Maybe I should stand still more often. A few moments to stop and take stock of what I have; a time to curb my appetite for the new. I have certainly had the opportunity to do that in the kitchen over the past few weeks: slowly working through what I already have in the house, the freezer (not a lot to be honest) and the garden. I wouldn’t say it has been a bad thing.</p><p>It has been something of a relief to clear the decks – I finally got the dried black beans out of the cupboard; finished off the annoying packet of mixed rice (never buy mixed varieties of rice in one packet, they all cook at different times); and I finally demolished that giant box of nougat but only because my favourite chocolate shop was closed. I’m setting my sights on finding a use for the jar of amaranth next.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/18/nigel-slaters-top-10-spring-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An attempt earlier this month to remove Nicolás Maduro from power ended in farcical failure as a seaborne invading force was captured easily following a series of mishaps. World affairs editor Julian Borger tells the bizarre story </p><p>It will go down as one of the least successful attempts to overthrow a government in modern history. The audacious plan by a former US army staff sergeant, Jordan Goudreau, to invade Venezuela by sea and capture Nicolás Maduro ended in a fiasco. The invading force, including two Americans, was quickly captured, with the deaths of eight men. The Associated Press had already published the plan for the invasion, the chief funders had withdrawn from the scheme and disowned it and the men were only lightly armed. Many were wearing shorts and T-shirts and suffering from seasickness. </p><p>The Guardian’s world affairs editor, <strong>Julian Borger, </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>how the plot began with a political fixer linked to the opposition leader Juan Guaidó, but ended in a spectacular failure that has emboldened Maduro. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/18/farce-and-tragedy-how-an-audacious-coup-attempt-in-venezuela-backfired">Continue reading...</a>
