The conclusion to The Witcher trilogy is one of our favorite games here at GameSpot; it's a part of the small collection of titles we've given a 10/10 review score.\n\nIn the video above, Jake Dekker explains The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's history, including how the game influenced the industry and cemented itself as a modern-day classic. If you haven't yet played Wild Hunt and want to do so after listening to Jake explain how important of a game it is, you should check out one of his other videos next: The Unreasonable But Correct Way To Play The Witcher 3. \n\nIn GameSpot's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review, Kevin VanOrd writes, \"And make no mistake: this is one of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement. But while the grand clashes are captivating, it is the moments between conflicts, when you drink with the local clans and bask in a trobairitz's song, that are truly inspiring.\"\n\n#TheWitcher3 #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If5U5Z4qj2M", "date_published": "2020-05-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath - Official Friendships Trailer", "description": "Mortal Kombat asks the important question, can we just be friends?
