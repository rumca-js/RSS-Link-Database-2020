dwm is based, just use it instead of i3 or awesome or whatever. I haven't used i3 in more than a year now and I've never looked back. A couple years ago, there were few patches for dwm, no good tutorials and a small community of people developing and adding cool stuff to dwm, now literally everyone is doing it and dwm is the best. As I say in the vid, if anything, dwm has more features than most wms because suckless keeps an online repository of patches, even marginal ones that are super-easy to add to your own build. dwm werks really well out of the box, but the stuff you can do with it is really amazing.
