<p>The Treasury cannot afford to spend £10bn a month indefinitely, but a cliff-edge end to Covid-19 wage subsidies is not the answer</p><p>What’s the safest way for Rishi Sunak to wind down his wage-support furlough scheme? Well, start by finding the correct language. The imagery in the current political talk about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/rishi-sunak-preparing-to-wind-down-furlough-scheme-from-july">“weaning” businesses off an “addiction”</a> is absurd.</p><p>When the chancellor introduced the coronavirus job retention scheme on 20 March, he said it was to “protect, as far as possible, people’s jobs and incomes”. There will be trouble if, less than two months later and with lockdown still in place, companies and their workers are portrayed as needy infants or addicts who should know better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/may/07/abrupt-end-furlough-scheme-uk-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The PM gets the first taste of a dogged cross-examination so clinical he can’t hide behind his characteristic bluster</p><p>For possibly the first time in his life, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy">Boris Johnson had appeared interested in changing a nappy</a>. “I’m sure it must be my turn now,” he had said hopefully. Carrie Symonds had merely looked confused. In desperation, Boris had next tried to ring Dominic Raab, but the phone went straight to voicemail. The foreign secretary wasn’t that stupid: there was no way he was going to risk a hat-trick of humiliations. Dominic Cummings had then gently taken the prime minister by the arm and led him to the Downing Street front door. It was time. The point of no return.</p><p>So it was a decidedly reluctant and somewhat sheepish Boris that appeared for his first prime minister’s questions up against Keir Starmer in the Commons. He had the air of a naughty schoolboy about to appear in front of the headteacher for repeatedly failing to hand in his homework and expecting a prolonged detention as punishment. If only Boris had managed to get off that lightly. By the end he had only made the situation worse by making countless promises he had no idea he would be able to keep and which would be certain to be added to later charge sheets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/bombastic-boris-meets-his-match-in-forensic-starmer-at-pmqs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A radical new form of universal basic income could revitalise damaged economies<br /><br /></p><li>Esther Duflo and Abhijit Banerjee won the 2019 Nobel prize in economics for their work on poverty alleviation</li><li><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li><p>While countries in east Asia and Europe are gradually taking steps towards reopening their economies, many in the global south are wondering whether the worst of the pandemic is yet to come. As economists who work on poverty alleviation in developing countries, we are often asked what the effects of coronavirus will be in south Asia and Africa. The truth is, we don’t know. Without extensive testing to map the number of cases, it’s impossible to tell how far the virus has already spread. We don’t yet have enough information about how Covid-19 behaves under different conditions such as sunlight, heat and humidity. Developing countries’ more <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/nov/18/sub-saharan-africa-youth-population-potential">youthful populations</a> may spare them the worst of the pandemic, but health systems in the global south are poorly equipped to deal with an outbreak, and poverty is linked to co-morbidities that put people at a higher risk of serious illness.</p><p>Without the information widespread testing provides, many poorer countries have taken an extremely cautious approach. India imposed a total <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/indias-13bn-population-locked-down-to-beat-coronavirus">lockdown on 24 March</a>, by which time the country had about 500 confirmed cases. Countries such as Rwanda, South Africa and Nigeria enforced lockdowns in late March, long before the virus was expected to peak. But these lockdown measures can’t last forever. Poorer countries could have used the quarantine to buy time, gather information about how the disease behaves and develop a testing and tracing strategy. Unfortunately, not much of this has happened. And, far from coming to their aid, rich countries have outrun poorer nations in the race for PPE, oxygen and ventilators.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/vulnerable-countries-poverty-deadly-coronavirus-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the End of October, a horrifying virus brings the world to standstill, a situation that the author has now seen for himself</p><p>The novel virus first emerged in east Asia. By spring, a pandemic suffuses the globe. In America, businesses shut down, airports empty, misinformation abounds.

This would be a decent summary of the past two months, if it wasn’t the plot to The End of October, a new novel by Lawrence Wright, which flies thrillingly, eerily close to reality – a global outbreak of a deadly pathogen with no known cure in the kinetic, flammable information torrent of the late 2010s.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/21/lawrence-wright-god-save-texas-journey-future-america-interview-looming-tower-911">Lawrence Wright: ‘It’s difficult to escape the Texas stereotype’</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/06/lawrence-wright-end-of-october-interview-pandemic-novel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Almond, polenta and oats are the home cook’s best kitchen friends when plain and self-raising flour are hard to find</p><p>For those of us summoned to our kitchens by lockdown, baking has become a welcome pastime with rewarding results. Now, I don’t consider myself much of a baker, but my scales have never been busier than in recent weeks. I have made no fewer than five double batches of Alison Roman’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/11/alison-roman-recipes-easy-feast-for-easter">tiny salty chocolatey cookies</a>, Anna Jones’ <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/mar/27/anna-jones-recipes-for-roast-rhubarb-and-chewy-rhubarb-cookies">rhubarb biscuits</a>, Milli Taylor’s now famed <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8bR80-Hd63/">brown butter banana bread</a>, Rosie Birkett’s <a href="https://everythinglooksrosie.com/rosie-makes-rhubarb-blondies/">rhubarb and white chocolate blondies</a>, Rachel Roddy’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/17/rachel-roddy-recipe-almond-apricot-tart">almond tart</a>, and her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2018/sep/17/rachel-roddy-recipe-almond-apricot-tart">ricotta and lemon cake</a>.</p><p>It’s been a journey of ups (see above) and downs, which range from the physical aspect – although no one’s seeing me below the shoulders, so whatevs – to the various shortages: first eggs, now flour, which has rendered all of the above impossible. What to do without a free-flowing supply of plain or self-raising? Well, plenty of things actually; in ingredients such as ground almonds, polenta, oats and coconut, the baker not only finds an effective stand-in for flour, but a distinct flavour profile and a whole new world of textures. Broaden your kitchen horizons with this baker’s dozen of flourless fancies from our archive.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/06/no-flour-no-problem-try-these-recipes-for-delicious-sweet-bakes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>90 Day Fiancé has done a terrible job in presenting a dangerous contestant – it should take a leaf out of Drag Race’s playbook and not give Geoffrey Paschel a platform</p><p>Contestants getting booted off of reality shows for misconduct is as core to the genre as the flinging of a drink in someone’s face during an argument. The disqualification of “Nasty” Nick Bateman from the first series of Big Brother for attempting to manipulate the house vote shook the nation – a move that 20 years later, would likely see him celebrated as an icon on the American iteration.</p><p>In 2012, Willam seemed in line to be crowned America’s next drag superstar, but left with the much more bad-ass title of the first ever Drag Race contestant to be disqualified. He was asked to leave after receiving a prohibited conjugal visit from his husband. But programmes often struggle with how to deal with cast behaviour that is too sinister to nearly package into a “villain edit”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/06/catfish-to-kidnap-what-to-do-when-a-reality-tv-villain-turns-criminal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I have found myself fantasising about a deeply unnecessary journey – a visit to every single underground stop. I have 85 to go ...<strong><br /></strong><br /></p><p>A month ago, I was worried about the places in this big wide world I might now never get to see, even if Covid-19 doesn’t take me. Then the focus narrowed to all the places, lovely and unlovely, in this country I might not visit. And now, logically enough in this great narrowing of all our worlds, my concerns are closer to home.</p><p>I have lived in London, on and off, since coming to college in October 1987. My first visit was around a decade before that, with my mum and dad, when I was about 10. Only two things stick in my mind from that day. One was the awesomely terrible old taxi rank below Euston station. I had rarely seen a black cab before, let alone hundreds in one place spewing out stuff that, even then, I suspected couldn’t be good for you. The other memories I have are of the tube: the distant rumble, rumbling louder and louder, and the gentle breeze slowly stiffening into a wind as this strange-looking train exploded out of the tunnel. It was the Piccadilly line. I know this, because I remember vividly that the train was bound for somewhere called Cockfosters. Four decades on, it pains me that I have yet to get to Cockfosters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/06/what-will-i-do-when-travel-restrictions-lift-complete-my-odyssey-to-all-270-london-tube-stations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor on walking the red carpet while having an allergic reaction, her controversial Calvin Klein campaign and dressing like Michael Jackson</p><p>I’m not known for wearing outfits that are as completely covered up as this. Often, you are uncomfortable on the red carpet, worried that something is going to pop out, unzip or break. There was something about this look that felt like protection and armour to me. I wore it to the 2018 CFDA fashion awards and I loved how extreme it felt: chic and strong, slightly androgynous but with a femininity to it. It came together nicely with no stress – until I was in the car, when I realised I was having some kind of allergic reaction to my makeup! One of my eyes swelled up right before I was stepping out on to the red carpet. I panicked and put on my reading glasses to camouflage the fact that one eye was almost completely shut!</p><p>As a teenager, my relationship with apparel was fraught because I never cultivated my own style. My mom and I bought everything from thrift shops – I would wear the same jeans all year and then cut them into shorts – but every time I would go on a set I would be decked out in designer clothes. There was a disconnect: clothes were just something belonging to other people that I would embody, and then shed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/06/brooke-shields-studio-54-i-wore-whatever-friends-were-wearing">Continue reading...</a>

An astonishing 71% of Europeans are now in favour of introducing a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/universal-basic-income">universal basic income</a>, according to an <a href="http://europeanmoments.com/opinions/eupinions">opinion poll</a> designed by my research team at Oxford university and published today. In Britain, the figure is 68%. Less encouraging, at least to anyone who believes in liberal democracy, is another startling finding in the survey: no less than 53% of young Europeans place more confidence in authoritarian states than in democracies to tackle the climate crisis. The poll was conducted by <a href="https://eupinions.eu/de/text/in-crisis-europeans-support-radical-positions">eupinions</a> in March, as most of Europe was locking down against the virus, but the questions had been formulated earlier. It would be fascinating now to ask Europeans which political system they think has proved better at combating a pandemic, as the United States and China, the world’s leading democracy and the world’s leading dictatorship, spray viral accusations at each other.</p><p>Those two contrasting but equally striking survey results show how high the stakes will be as we emerge from the immediate medical emergency, and face the subsequent economic pandemic and its political fallout. What kind of historical moment will this turn out to be, for Europe and the world? It could lead us to the best of times.

Tamzin Outhwaite, one of the cast, is lucky that her partner is a director (although he is not used to shooting on an old iPhone). Her 11-year-old daughter is also helping with the camerawork. Is it weird acting in front of her children? She gives a throaty laugh. “Of course it’s weird.”</p><p>Outhwaite, still best known from her time in EastEnders, will star in Dun Breedin’, a comedy-drama created by the actor Julie Graham about a group of women brought together in a menopause support group. Outhwaite plays Indie, a free spirit who is trying to get through the hormonal change “with yoga and breathing. Other characters are like: ‘You need to get some HRT.’” As well as Graham, the other actors include Angela Griffin, Tracy Ann Oberman and Denise Welch (they are real-life friends), all filming their scenes from home to create 12 episodes, each just 10 minutes, to be shown on YouTube.

Especially in smaller libraries, we’re sometimes the only ones people see in a week,” says Carol Stump, chief librarian at Kirklees council in West Yorkshire. “We wanted to be sure that with libraries in lockdown, people could still access our services. And we felt they might be glad of a chat.”</p><p>Stump runs a team of 110 library staff. Many of them have been redeployed during the pandemic, but those still working for the library service are keeping in touch with local people, particularly those over 70. Calls help people feel less isolated, and library staff can check whether they have enough food and medical supplies, or need other support. One 90-year-old man, for example, was missing his regular trip to the library to read the local paper, but is now able to read it online. “It’s gone down so well.

<p>With limited access to abortion and antenatal care, many young mothers are falling prey to the country’s human traffickers </p><p>Two months after 17-year-old Ebere fell pregnant last year, she considered having an abortion. But she was told by a doctor that such a process – eight weeks into her pregnancy – could lead to complications. </p><p>Going home to her parents after visiting the doctor wasn’t an option for Ebere, who feared her strict father would beat her and shame her in their neighbourhood. The father of the baby had denied all responsibility and threatened to kill her if she ever tried to contact him again.<br /><br />A nurse, who saw the troubled young girl sitting in the hospital, approached her to find out what was wrong. Ebere explained her situation and the nurse showed her a Facebook page of a man she said was a social worker who helped pregnant women in her position. She told her to call the phone number.<br /><br />“When I called and explained my situation, he asked me to meet him at a popular restaurant in town,” says Ebere, speaking to the Guardian in her home city of Enugu, in south-eastern Nigeria. “When we met, he offered to take me to his home and care for me until I gave birth, but only if I was willing to sell the baby to him.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/06/i-had-no-choice-the-desperate-nigerian-women-who-sell-their-babies">Continue reading...</a>

This week’s picture, shot by Gerry Cranham in 1963, is of the great Cassius Clay, aka Muhammad Ali</p><p>“They all fall in the round I call,” boasted Cassius Clay, later Muhammad Ali, of his uncanny ability to predict when he would defeat his opponents. The brash young American boxer told reporters it would take only five rounds to finish off Britain’s Henry Cooper in their first contest in 1963 – as displayed in this memorable image by Gerry Cranham, shot at a training hall in Shepherd’s Bush. However, the fight didn’t exactly go to plan. In the final seconds of the fourth round, it was Clay who hit the deck, dizzied by a left hook from his bloodied opponent. He was so badly shaken, in fact, that myth has it his trainer, Angelo Dundee, surreptitiously worsened a tear in his gloves, forcing an inspection between the rounds that bought his fighter valuable extra seconds in which to recover. When the fight resumed … well, you know the rest: Cooper was vanquished in the fifth, just as Clay had prophesied.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/06/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-cassius-clay-predicts-the-future">Continue reading...</a>

Officials and ministers say he carried that attitude into politics. His career has been fuelled by adrenaline wrung from the last minute of every decision, which means he has probably not yet given much thought to Brexit transitional arrangements. They expire at the end of the year. If an extension is wanted, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-complications-december-brexit">deadline for seeking one</a> is 30 June.

## Sleazy bosses, exploited barmaids: US cinema finally discovers the left behinds

<p>From The Assistant to Support the Girls, American cinema is swapping feelgood escapism for gritty unsettling realism. We talk to the women spearheading this new wave</p><p> ‘I wanted it to be relatable to any woman who’s ever worked in an office,” says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/the-assistant-kitty-green-metoo-weinstein-inspired-thriller">Kitty Green</a> of her new film The Assistant. “Everything in the film has been in the press already. But I wanted to take viewers on an emotional journey, so they could empathise with the character.”</p><p>The #MeToo saga has been examined to near exhaustion, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/23/the-assistant-review-metoo-drama-offers-unsettling-study-of-day-to-day-abuse">The Assistant</a> manages to add something new. Rather than perpetrators or victims, it focuses on a relative bystander: a young office worker at a New York film production company. We follow this character, played by Julia Garner, through her demeaning routine: commuting in before daybreak, photocopying, printing, taking her male co-workers’ lunch orders, clearing up leftover pizza from the meeting room (as the men come in for the next meeting, she is humiliatingly caught with a crust in her mouth).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/06/sleazy-bosses-exploited-barmaids-us-cinema-finally-discovers-left-behinds-assistant-support-the-girls-women">Continue reading...</a>
