Rufus Norris and Maria Balshaw swap notes", "description": "<p>The boss of the National Theatre and director of Tate Gallery discuss how culture has been hit by \u2013 and responded to \u2013 Covid-19, and what happens post-lockdown <br /></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage here</a></li></ul><p>At 2.30pm Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/07/maria-balshaw-fresh-slate-tate-modern-african-american-new-director-exhibitions-society\"> Maria Balshaw,</a> director of Tate art museums and galleries, convene on screen \u2013 the new abnormal \u2013 for a conversation about the Covid-19 crisis and how they plan to help their institutions survive it. Norris is first to admit our get-together is not ideal as his blurred silhouette appears: \u201cI\u2019m at home, in the bedroom, because it\u2019s the best internet spot. If things get really bad, I\u2019ll have to speak to you on the phone.\u201d Balshaw, at home in Kent, is similarly quick to identify the idiosyncrasies in her new working life: \u201cI\u2019ve got my museum director husband [Nick Merriman, chief executive of Horniman Museum] with me \u2013 we rotate in and out of this room.\u201d</p><p>Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a \u00a3110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a \u00a3160m <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/arts-council-england-promises-160m-to-buoy-public-during-lockdown\">emergency package across the cultural sector</a>, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/23/what-next-for-the-arts-rufus-norris-and-maria-balshaw-swap-notes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/23/what-next-for-the-arts-rufus-norris-and-maria-balshaw-swap-notes", "date_published": "2020-05-23 12:04:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "F1 teams agree to introduce budget cap from 2021 onwards", "description": "<ul><li>Limit of \u00a3119m next year set to keep sport sustainable</li><li>Spending to be further reduced on a sliding scale</li></ul><p>Formula One teams have agreed to impose a new budget cap from 2021.
