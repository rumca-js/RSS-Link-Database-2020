Ask him whether players can expect the Premiership’s eventual return to be close to what went before and he is likewise outspoken. “When we resume playing, there will be a new normal regarding costs and personnel is part of that: nothing is off the table.”</p><p>Vaughan is not alone among the chief executives of Premiership clubs in regarding the current sporting lockdown as an opportunity to reset businesses that have tended over the years to be guided by dreams rather than reality and relied on the largesse of owners and backers. Vaughan says: “We would love to think that things will go back to where they were, but clearly there will be an impact. You want to do the best you can for the excellent people we have here and that keeps you awake at night.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/wasps-chief-steven-vaughan-premiership-rugby-union-new-normal">Continue reading...</a>

## Barton Gellman: ‘The Assange precedent is dangerous’

<p>The US journalist talks about being hacked by intelligence services, his dealings with whistleblower Edward Snowden, and why he loves detective fiction</p><p>Barton Gellman is an investigative journalist celebrated for his reports on 9/11, former US vice-president Dick Cheney and the surveillance state. He was the only mainstream journalist that Edward Snowden approached in 2013 to publish his revelations about far-ranging cyber surveillance by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files">US National Security Agency</a>. His new book, <em>Dark Mirror,</em> is an account of his interactions with Snowden and the struggle to expose the US government’s assault on privacy.</p><p><strong>The spectrum of opinion on Edward Snowden runs from heroic whistleblower to shameless traitor. What’s your own understanding of the man?</strong><br />Those labels seem to me like cartoons. I see him as being quite sincere in his beliefs. I think he was motivated more or less exactly as he described. He has a very black and white sense of right and wrong. I described him in the book as sharing certain elements with other self-described whistleblowers: zealotry and certitude of their own beliefs. But I believe his ultimate choices were heartfelt. My own view is that he did more good than harm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/23/barton-gellman-the-assange-precedent-is-dangerous">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Intensifying economic pressures have led to plummeting birth rates in Britain and America</p><p><br />Financial insecurity is one of the best, most sensible reasons not to have a baby. It’s also one of the saddest and creepiest.</p><p>The US birthrate is <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/worries-over-money-take-us-birthrate-to-record-low-qnsx3n92l">at its lowest</a> for 35 years, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. The sharpest fall was teenagers, but rates dropped in almost every age and race group. There are indications that people are delaying having children until they’re older or don’t feel they should enlarge their families. There are similar drops elsewhere, including the UK in 2018, with the Office for National Statistics <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-49192445">reporting a fall of 3.2%</a> from 2017, down nearly 10% from 2012. In particular, millennial Britons appeared to be indefinitely deferring children because of practical considerations such as insecure work, low wages and unaffordable housing. Like I say, sensible, but sickening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/23/it-is-a-tragedy-that-women-are-being-turned-away-from-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>

On the banks of the River Derwent, construction has just restarted on the Museum of Making. It occupies the site of a 1721 silk mill which the city says was the world’s first factory. It will now open next year, on the mill’s 300th anniversary.

Sourdough differs from most bread in that it contains no baker’s yeast, relying instead on a fermented “starter” of water and flour to provide lift. This also provides its sour flavour and chewy texture.</p><p>It could be the reduced availability of baker’s yeast in shops, or perhaps the time-poor with a theoretical interest in sourdough finally found time to don their aprons. Whatever the reason, the sourdough revival has gone into overdrive.

<p>The boss of the National Theatre and director of Tate Gallery discuss how culture has been hit by – and responded to – Covid-19, and what happens post-lockdown <br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage here</a></li></ul><p>At 2.30pm Rufus Norris, director of the National Theatre and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/07/maria-balshaw-fresh-slate-tate-modern-african-american-new-director-exhibitions-society"> Maria Balshaw,</a> director of Tate art museums and galleries, convene on screen – the new abnormal – for a conversation about the Covid-19 crisis and how they plan to help their institutions survive it. Norris is first to admit our get-together is not ideal as his blurred silhouette appears: “I’m at home, in the bedroom, because it’s the best internet spot. If things get really bad, I’ll have to speak to you on the phone.” Balshaw, at home in Kent, is similarly quick to identify the idiosyncrasies in her new working life: “I’ve got my museum director husband [Nick Merriman, chief executive of Horniman Museum] with me – we rotate in and out of this room.”</p><p>Erratic bandwidth is the least of the problems Norris and Balshaw face. Before lockdown, there was a £110bn creative industries sector, the fastest-growing in the UK. Now, the challenge is to keep cultural institutions out of intensive care. For although Arts Council England has launched a £160m <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/arts-council-england-promises-160m-to-buoy-public-during-lockdown">emergency package across the cultural sector</a>, the longer our museums and theatres remain closed, the more perilous their future becomes. But beyond the immediate question of when the Tate and National might reopen, this is, more positively, a moment of potential change: there are questions of how cultural appetites are altering as art in lockdown becomes more democratic. And questions about whether the Covid-19 crisis will make a good subject for theatre. What sort of art might develop post-lockdown?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/23/what-next-for-the-arts-rufus-norris-and-maria-balshaw-swap-notes">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Limit of £119m next year set to keep sport sustainable</li><li>Spending to be further reduced on a sliding scale</li></ul><p>Formula One teams have agreed to impose a new budget cap from 2021. After lengthy negotiations, F1 will be decreasing spending on a sliding scale over several years. The cap will be set at $145m (£119m) in 2021, dropping to $140m in 2022, then $135m for 2023–25. A further review will then take place to establish the ceiling for 2026 and beyond.</p><p>The cap is seen as a vital component of ensuring the sport remains sustainable in future and in pursuit of levelling the playing field across the grid, which is currently skewed by major spending differentials. F1 and the FIA have been pursuing a spending cut for some time but the financial implications of the coronavirus pandemic pushed the sport to go further than expected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/23/f1-teams-agree-to-introduce-budget-cap-from-2021-onwards">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Italians put these bitter greens at the heart of classic peasant dishes. Growing your own is as simple as scatter and go</p><p>The taste of bitter greens, swirled into the holy trinity of garlic, olive oil and chilli pepper to make cicoria ripassata alla Romano, is one of those simple yet delicious dishes we all need right now. There’s another, lighter version that calls for lemon juice and salt instead of garlic and chilli. And I go weak at the knees for the Pugliese take, where the greens are comforted in a puree of broad beans and garlic. Better yet, these are some of the easiest of greens to grow: simply open the seed packet and scatter.</p><p>These are all classic cucina povera – peasant food – dishes, in this case using chicory leaves, which originally would have been foraged from meadows and field margins.

<p>Whether abandoned because of plague, erosion or MoD requisition, ghost villages will make for fascinating and salutary visits – once they reopen</p><p>Most of Britain’s ghost towns were abandoned after a previous pandemic – the Black Death – wiped out entire populations from hundreds of villages. The greatest losses were in Norfolk and Suffolk, often the landing points for plague-infested ships. </p><p>Coastal erosion also contributed to settlements in these counties disappearing into the sea. The most famous, <strong><a href="https://www.thesuffolkcoast.co.uk/suffolk-coast-towns-and-villages/dunwich">Dunwich</a></strong>, was a thriving port, equivalent in size to 14th-century London, before the sea swallowed it and its eight churches, earning Dunwich the name England’s Atlantis. While the majority of British “ghost villages” have all but disappeared, a few still offer rewards – and warnings – for the curious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/23/historic-ghost-villages-tyneham-dunwich-imber">Continue reading...</a>

## Hydra, the Greek island for dreamers | Polly Samson

<p>The author of a new novel inspired by the heady days of Leonard Cohen and his bohemian set longs to return to the island of vivid colours and stories</p><p>The last time I left Hydra – was it really only two months ago? – I was careful not to forget to throw some coins into the harbour from the ferry. It’s a superstition I picked up from Didy Cameron, one of the real-life characters in my novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/05/a-theatre-for-dreamers-by-polly-samson-review">A Theatre for Dreamers</a>, who believed it would ensure her return. Except one day she didn’t have a coin to hand and, as her granddaughter Alice told me, she never made it back to the island. The morning after I threw my coins and we left Hydra, the Greek government closed all the country’s schools. In the UK, however, my daughter was returning to school after study leave. . If I was still on the island, we’d be slowly emerging from lockdown into the sunshine of a spotless Greek island.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/23/hydra-the-greek-island-for-dreamers">Continue reading...</a>

## Rain on rooftops: the strange appeal of 'slow audio'

<p>First there was slow TV – now radio and podcasts are getting in on the act with ambient recordings of forest walks and bird calls</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/picture/2020/may/23/modern-toss">Modern Toss on audio podcasts</a></li></ul><p>For 18 minutes, nothing interrupts the purr of insects bar the sound of kookaburras calling, and a solitary passing car. This is Field Recordings, a creation of the London-based radio producer Eleanor McDowall, “a podcast where audio-makers stand silently in fields”. Boasting submissions from all over the world, the first episode debuted in March and captures the sounds of an Australian town at dusk. Highlights from the more than 70 episodes since include a recording from the inside of a hollow tree in Russia, which becomes an orchestra of creaks and whistles as it sways in the wind. It is, in McDowall’s words, “a real banger”.</p><p><a href="https://fieldrecordings.xyz/">Field Recordings</a> was born after a tough year in which McDowall experienced the end of a relationship and began to feel burnt out at work. Compiling this library of ambient soundscapes was part of her solution. “It felt like something that would give me a bit of space and respite,” she says. Many of us now adopt similar strategies to capture moments of contemplation, focus or distraction. Music-streaming platforms offer playlists tailored to heighten concentration. Guided-meditation apps offer complementary audio “soundscapes” such as “the cosy sound of rain on a cabin roof”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/23/rain-on-rooftops-and-crunching-gravel-the-strange-appeal-of-slow-audio-field-recordings">Continue reading...</a>
