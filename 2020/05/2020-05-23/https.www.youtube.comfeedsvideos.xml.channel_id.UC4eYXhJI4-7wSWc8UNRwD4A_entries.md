We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Listen to any Lionel Loueke record long enough, and you'll wonder, "How did he make that noise?" The West African-born jazz guitarist has developed an extensive palette of sounds, experimenting with low tunings, fast finger techniques, nylon strings, acoustic and electric axes, even jamming paper in his strings. And he also sings — or, more accurately, vocalizes. The clicks, wet smacks, the singing-along-to-his-solos, even the spasmodic speaking-in-tongues exhortations; he says they just come naturally to him.

Naturally, when Loueke's trio came to Washington, D.C., earlier this year, we asked him to demonstrate his toolkit in a Tiny Desk Concert. The Tiny Desk is a pretty tiny desk, but it still felt a bit unfair to the rest of his band. The group is led by Loueke almost in name only; the drummer and bassist both compose for the group, and their input has shaped Loueke's language, even apart from the trio, for more than 10 years of playing together.

Luckily, the trio arrived at our cramped stage, whereupon drummer Ferenc Nemeth shrugged and declared, "Yeah, I'll play." I asked him whether I could get him a snare drum or cymbal stands or anything, and he waved me off, pulling out bells, bundle sticks and a little rig set up around a hand drum and a jangly tambourine. Game on.

Nemeth and Loueke treated us to impromptu duet versions of "Vi Ma Yon" — a traditional song that appears on Loueke's latest, Mwaliko — and another tune from the group's songbook, "Merci." (Their recording of Wayne Shorter's "Nefertiti," which doesn't appear on this page, will be available on A Blog Supreme this week.) Jammy and exploratory, it felt like jazz with West African accents — or was it West African music with jazz sensibilities? See and hear for yourself.

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 23, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- Recording a Tiny Desk concert at home naturally subtracts a lot of familiar elements: Bob Boilen's desk, for example; the wooden shelves full of weird ephemera; the crowd of work-shirking news-gatherers and the applause they provide. But when Clem Snide (the three-decade-old project of singer-songwriter Eef Barzelay) and special guest Scott Avett (the Avett Brothers co-founder who produced and performs on Clem Snide's latest album, Forever Just Beyond) performed together in Avett's barn, they added a few new features you've never gotten to hear at the Tiny Desk — most notably a noisy flock of birds and the unmistakable cries of a nearby rooster.

We've had a few disruptive animals at the Tiny Desk over the years, from the occasional dog to Bob Boilen himself, but this had to be our first rooster. As for Barzelay and Avett, they not only maintained social distancing throughout their set, but also rigorously enforced it with the aid of a visible tape measure. Still, their voices blended warmly as they tackled three spiritually searching songs from the (great) new record, as well as an older track that fits Forever Just Beyond's themes perfectly: "Jews for Jesus Blues," from Clem Snide's 2005 album End of Love.

SET LIST
"The Stuff of Us"
"Jews for Jesus Blues"
"Some Ghost"
"Roger Ebert"
