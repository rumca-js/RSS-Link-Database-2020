THANK YOU to all my subscribers! I wanted to find a way to celebrate this little milestone, and so I did.

Inspired by a tweet from Dan Linder, I decided to try building a large Kubernetes cluster in AWS, and running TEN THOUSAND pods on itâ€”one for each subscriber.

The process was a little rocky, and I ended up spending a *lot* more time on it than I probably should've, but it was worth it!
