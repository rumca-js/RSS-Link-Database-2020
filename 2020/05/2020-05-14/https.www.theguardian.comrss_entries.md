Now they can return to the subject in 2020. As the US presidential election approaches, Trump’s anti-China stance on Covid is intensifying and this week produced a highly unusual piece of policy-making in Washington.</p><p>The extraordinary episode was the order, more or less, from the US administration that a $600bn US federal pension fund should drop a long-planned investment in Chinese shares. Strictly speaking, the intended investment by the Thrift Savings Plan was merely a re-allocation of a portion of its portfolio into a global share index that includes China. But it was enough to enrage the White House.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/may/14/investors-can-return-to-obsessing-over-relations-between-us-and-china">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The challenges of looking after the welfare of children in school and online are actually very similar, starting with a strong safeguarding culture. Headteachers explain how it’s done<br /></p><p>When it became apparent that the school lockdown was imminent, principal Vicki Redhead and her team at Bishop Creighton academy, a primary school in Peterborough, wrestled with a tricky issue. How can you make online-only learning as safe as possible? They came up with a simple solution. The devices they used at school were already set up and locked down. Why not just let children take those school devices home?</p><p>“Otherwise, those devices – which were bought for the benefit of the children – were just going to sit in a cupboard,” she says. “Luckily, we had already made the decision that every child should have their own device. You’d never ask a child to share an exercise book.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/online-learning-revolution/2020/may/14/how-headteachers-are-keeping-pupils-safe-while-remote-schooling">Continue reading...</a>

In March they were largely questions about children with separated parents. Could they visit both homes?

Another asks whether she has to go to work if she doesn’t have childcare – and dozens wonder whether they can legally refuse to work if their husband/wife/nan/child is shielding, or if they don’t have a car, or their employer can’t guarantee social distancing? That’s without mentioning the requests for advice on wearing masks, washing clothes, home-teaching six-year-olds and the best alcohol level in hand-sanitiser.

<p>Despite lockdown work commitments, the actor has found time to watch everything from Netflix’s acclaimed football documentary to Quiz and Love Is Blind</p><p>The TV industry has mostly shut down, but I’ve still been working during lockdown. I’m filming a series of shorts from the actor Julie Graham about five women who are in various stages of menopause, and before that I made Isolation Stories for ITV. Making it really tested all of my skills and made me appreciate my crew and what goes into everything behind the scenes when we’re just standing on our mark, pretending to cry. I’m really proud of the industry for finding a way to still be creative.<br /><br />I’ve still made time to relax, though. Watching a film together as a family, with my husband and our two daughters, who are 16 and 13, has become the highlight of our day. As for series, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/quiz-review-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-charles-ingram-diana-drama">I thought Quiz (ITV) was amazing</a>. I know the makeup designer who transformed Michael Sheen into Chris Tarrant – I sent her a huge congratulations text because he looked so amazing. Matthew Macfadyen was brilliant, too - he’s an incredible dramatic actor and so great in everything he does, from Spooks to Succession. I could watch him all day. James Graham is another genius. His writing is so, so clever, especially his political pieces. I’d love to see him write about the current crisis.<br /><br />Amanda Holden told me to watch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/27/sunderlands-til-i-die-second-series-fans-stress-spanners-dismay">Sunderland Til I Die (Netflix) </a>and I was like: “Why are you watching that?!” But it’s a drama like any other. You absolutely don’t need to understand football to get into it – it’s about what happens when a company is in trouble, and all the things that people try to do to stop it collapsing. I got really invested in it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/14/amanda-holden-recommended-sunderland-til-i-die-angela-griffins-lockdown-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC, Nintendo Switch (version reviewed); Megagon Industries</strong><br />Hurling yourself down a mountain on a bike has rarely been as much fun as in this pared-down sports game, which pairs serene scenery with thrilling challenge</p><p>Newly released on Nintendo Switch, Lonely Mountains: Downhill has been catching attention on other consoles and PCs since last October. But it is now, stuck indoors in an urban flat, that I have really needed this game about solitary mountain bike adventures in nature. It is an intriguing hybrid of serene exploration and reflex-challenging speed-chasing, and is engrossing from the first moment – each thrilling downhill run begins with a moment of pure stillness at the peak, one foot on the ground, the wind whistling in your ears.</p><p>With minute adjustments to the bike’s trajectory, you plummet down serene mountains, either following dirt paths or veering off-road to cut trails between rocks and trees. It’s like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/feb/28/trials-rising-review-motorbike-racing-game-motocross">Trials</a>, the motocross puzzler masquerading as a racing game, except instead of roaring engines and screaming guitars on the soundtrack, you hear rustling leaves, birdsong and the quiet clicking of gears. On the verdant Mount Graterhorn, butterflies flit around conifers; the more treacherous Sierra Rivera is devoid of anything but windblown dust, jutting rocks and the occasional cactus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/may/14/lonely-mountains-downhill-review-nintendo-switch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I have three frying pans but two are really only there for use on violent intruders. I might be losing the plot …</p><p>The non-meat chopping board I have used for more than a decade is awful. It is a mini butcher’s block, at least 10cm thick, half a metre long and so heavy I cannot pick it up with one hand. It will not fit in the sink to be washed efficiently. And, of course, it’s made of wood, which is never ideal. There’s probably now more culture on its surface than on a whole night of BBC Four. It is dreadful in so many ways. I also can’t imagine cooking without it.</p><p>Like everyone else, I’ve spent far too much time in the kitchen recently doing a culinary version of rinse and repeat. During this marathon cookathon, I’ve come to realise that there are objects in there which aren’t just useful. They are vital to my sense of self as a cook. I depend upon them. That stupid, cumbersome, ill-thought out, much-loved chopping board is only the start of it. For example, I have three sets of tongs in my utensil drawer. I say “drawer”; I really mean “yawning maw of wretched chaos that is a visualisation of my confused inner self”. There’s a long black plastic number with tips that are incapable of gripping. There’s a springy metal set that are so short you’ll also chargrill your hand on a flame if you try to use them over the cooker.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/14/jay-rayner-happy-eater-emotionally-attached-frying-pans-stir-crazy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Writers, chefs and musicians have instilled a wanderlust in our readers but so, too, have heroic grandads and intrepid aunts</p><p>Anthony Bourdain every time. He was not perfect, and some episodes of his TV shows are hard to watch given what we know now about his mental health struggles. But he showed the joys of travel: a drink and a chat with the table next door; eating street food at the stalls with the longest queues; and navigating the morals of travelling with humility and open eyes when you’re often richer than the local people. I started watching his shows in my 20s, and it was because of him that we roughed it across Morocco, landed in Mumbai with no plans, and went to the most expensive wineries we could on a shoestring in Italy (arriving sweaty on bikes – they weren’t impressed). He changed my life.<br /><strong>Lydia Taylor</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/14/bourdain-buena-vista-social-club-readers-travel-heroes">Continue reading...</a>

Few suspected that the rivalry and antagonism between China and the west would be framed by a global pandemic, and by the challenges – and opportunities – that it has offered to countries around the world, not least China itself.</p><p>China was where Covid-19 struck first; and it is where life is getting back to normal, albeit slowly. Manufacturing and production are rising, with factories open and starting to get back to similar levels to the second half of last year.

<p>This perfect fusion of hypnotic dance pulses with melodic majesty and is a global smash that even the anti-pop brigade can enjoy</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/27/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s">Read our 100 greatest list as it counts down</a></li></ul><p>Last month, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/kylieminogue">Kylie Minogue</a> shared on Instagram a viral video of a dog, eyes closed in blissful repose, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B_FkTENAyLH/">nodding along to its favourite song</a>. The tune in question was Minogue’s 2001 classic Can’t Get You Out of My Head, a minimalist, timeless smash that, as the dog’s reaction clearly shows, affects the head as adeptly as the feet. A global No 1 that even the anti-pop brigade can enjoy, it is both the sweaty highlight of any wedding reception dancefloor and the crux of an argument in Words and Music, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/aug/16/music">a gloriously verbose book</a> by critic Paul Morley in which he calls it an example of pop’s “occasional odd shine of mind-changing art”.</p><p>Written by then semi-retired pop star Cathy Dennis and the former Mud guitarist Rob Davis, it was initially offered to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/10/s-club-7-paul-cattermole-interview">S Club 7</a>.

It took Kylie 20 seconds of listening to the demo for her to realise the track was special. And what an opening 20 seconds it is: straight out of the gate there is that pulsating, unnervingly timeless bass line, instantly recalling electronic pioneers such as Kraftwerk and New Order (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fMVsNw9tKk">Kylie performed the song’s bootleg mashup</a> with Blue Monday at the Brits in 2002, arriving on a giant CD) before the chorus arrives earlier than expected on a hypnotic flurry of “la, la, las”. (Also of note: the oft-ignored meandering organ flurries that lurk behind the verses, subtly massaging the song’s forward momentum.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/14/the-greatest-uk-no-1s-ever-no-17-kylie-minogue-cant-get-you-out-of-my-head">Continue reading...</a>

The stage was wide open for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/04/george-osborne-eliminating-current-deficit-austerity-terrible-cost-hubris">George Osborne</a>, helped by the mainstream media, to just focus on the deficit alone. The result was a recovery from recession that should have happened in 2010 being delayed until 2013.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/14/the-scare-stories-about-government-debt-are-back-ignore-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With unlimited exercise now allowed in parts of the UK, three writers venture outside to explore their local neighbourhoods</p><p>Since the lockdown began almost two months ago, I’ve been off the bike other than for weekly shopping trips and short rides around the block with my young children. As with many cyclists, I turned to an indoor (static) trainer to keep my legs moving. But it’s a poor substitute. Yes, you sit on the saddle, hold the handlebars and turn the pedals, but that’s where the similarity ends. Instead of the lightness of being that comes from riding a bike, you have to endure futile pedalling, profuse sweating and a profound and spirit-sapping boredom. The latest home trainers offer online access and have a display of virtual roads to ride, mountains to climb and other people to race – but it never compares to the real thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/14/outdoors-again-at-last-first-walk-run-and-cycle-after-quarantine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amid this unfolding disaster, we have seen countless acts of kindness and solidarity. It’s this spirit of generosity that will help guide us out of this crisis and into a better future. By Rebecca Solnit</p><p>People behaving badly is a staple of the news, and the pandemic has given us plenty of lurid snapshots. In the US alone, we have seen protesters with guns in Michigan’s capital demanding an end to lockdown, anti-vaxxer women <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/anti-vaxxers-coronavirus-protests.html" title="">in a frenzy</a> at California’s capitol, opportunists stockpiling hand sanitiser to resell for profit.</p><p>One of the biggest cliches about disasters is that they reveal civilisation as a thin veneer, beneath which lies brutal human nature. From this perspective, the best we can hope for from most people under crisis is selfish indifference; at worst, they will swiftly turn to violence. Our worst instincts must be repressed. This becomes a justification for authoritarianism and heavy-handed policing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US election campaign is usually in full swing by this stage of the political cycle, but the coronavirus pandemic has put a halt to rallies and fundraising events. David Smith in Washington looks at how the race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden is playing out </p><p>No sooner had Senator Joe Biden staged a remarkable political comeback to seal the Democratic party’s presidential nomination than he was forced into lockdown as coronavirus struck America. In the White House, Donald Trump switched from holding rallies to hosting freewheeling daily coronavirus press conferences. As the economy was forced into shutdown and the death toll grew, his poll ratings began to drop. </p><p>The Guardian’s Washington bureau chief, <strong>David Smith, </strong>tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>that this is an election campaign like no other. Trump has been determined to offload any blame for the current crisis on to the media, the previous administration and China. Biden, stuck campaigning from his basement in Delaware, has been forced to defend himself from allegations of sexual assault brought by a former staffer. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/14/trump-versus-biden-the-2020-pandemic-election">Continue reading...</a>

Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvWXwVWJiq4&amp;t=2s">signature moves</a>, carried out with a coffin in tow, include dropping to all-fours and crawling in unison; or lying on their backs, the coffin balanced on top of them, legs moving in time to the music – as though they have been crushed by the casket.</p><p>The dancing pallbearers first became famous in 2017 when their so-called “coffin dance” featured in a BBC documentary. Then, someone added an EDM track and a meme was born: footage of the dancers was spliced with botched feats of strength and other accidents and posted all over the internet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/why-should-you-cry-ghanas-dancing-pallbearers-find-new-fame-during-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>
