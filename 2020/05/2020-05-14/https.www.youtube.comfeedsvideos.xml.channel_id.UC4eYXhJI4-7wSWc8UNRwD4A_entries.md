The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 15, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- As the angelic riffs start and the camera fades up, I was immediately captivated by the artwork that adorns the walls for this Tiny Desk from home. The artist is 3-year-old Isley-Rose; the singer is her mother, Alex Isley. The name they both share is courtesy of R&B royalty Ernie Isley, currently one half of the incomparable Isley Brothers and Alex's father. For nearly a decade now, Alex Isley has slowly but surely made a name for herself, hitting the radar of NPR's Heat Check playlist and recently landing a spot on the soundtrack for this season of HBO's Insecure.

From her Los Angeles home, Isley takes us on a tour of her discography, starting with "About Him" from 2013's Dreams in Analog and closing with her latest single, "Gone." But before we get to the finale, we're treated to the premiere of a brand new song, "Rain Clouds," which was produced by 9th Wonder (a storied hip-hop producer that we recently featured on NPR's new songwriting series The Formula). Her luscious tone and perfectly placed runs send me straight to Zen whenever I hear them. Allow Alex Isley to take you there, too.

SET LIST
"About Him"
"Into Orbit"
"Rain Clouds"
"Gone"

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

May 14, 2020 | Stephen Thompson -- We were scheduled to host a Tiny Desk performance by Arkansas-born country singer Ashley McBryde on March 31. Obviously, we had to postpone McBryde's visit, but lucky for us, she didn't push back the release of her stellar second album, Never Will, which came out April 3. For her Tiny Desk (home) concert, McBryde and her bandmates isolated and washed their hands before coming together to perform one of our Best Songs Of 2019, "One Night Standards," and three more gorgeous songs from Never Will. In particular, "Hang In There Girl" — which opens both the album and this set — is a perfect song for this moment, not that there's ever a wrong time to hear someone sing, "Trust me when I say, you're doing fine."

SET LIST
"Hang In There Girl"
"One Night Standards"
"Velvet Red"
"Sparrow"
