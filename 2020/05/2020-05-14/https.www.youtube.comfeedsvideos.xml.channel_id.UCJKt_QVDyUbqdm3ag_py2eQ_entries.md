"Hybris" (Amiga, 1988) ingame theme by Paul van der Valk. This upload is intended for headphones only.

Note: the space color in the image is edited to be true black all around in this upload. Originally there is this weird less-than-true-black haze covering most of it (can be seen in my title theme upload linked below).

Title theme upload from yesteryear here (emulated audio) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_3-39HZ2so

Made using real A1200 Rev. 1D.4 audio.
