<p>Scared to find out what’s lurking at the back of your freezer? Here are expert tips for how to get it organised – and what you should never put in there</p><p>Do not feel guilty if you neglect your freezer. It happens to the best of us. “I don’t think I cleaned ours at home in a year until lockdown,” confesses Nina Matsunaga, the chef-owner at the Black Bull Inn in Sedbergh, Cumbria. “We do our work freezer every couple of days.”</p><p>Like Matsunaga, many of us are looking anew at our freezers. Covid-19 has concentrated minds on saving money, minimising waste and shopping less frequently. People are storing more, collectively, and after a 30% spike in the month before lockdown, frozen food sales have continued to rise, according to the British Frozen Food Federation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/14/into-the-icy-depths-the-10-rules-for-freezing-food-from-berries-to-beef">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Changing rooms out of bounds, rakes removed from bunkers and no roll-ups, but a round of golf in Devon was never sweeter</p><p>The fairway was newly mown and welcoming; a yellow flag, 350 yards away, flickered in the chill breeze descending off Dartmoor as the sun made an appearance through wispy clouds. With driver in hand and provisional ball in pocket I stepped on to the first tee at Okehampton Golf Club and, for the first time in a couple of months, attempted to hit a golf ball further than the seven yards available in the back garden. What a relief to swing that club, not just because the ball was soon airborne in vaguely the right direction; here was a glimmer that life might one day return to normal.</p><p>The club pro, Ashley, had greeted us on the first tee. They do not usually have a starter at Okehampton, perhaps the friendliest, unstuffiest club in Devon. But this felt like a special occasion; the club was coming back to life and so too were its golfers. The course was in superb condition, the fairways neatly manicured, the bluebells in bloom, the greens fast and true and treacherous (still). Ricki, the course manager, had still been out there cutting the grass at 9pm on Tuesday to make sure everything was perfect; neither he nor the greenkeeper, Mike, had been furloughed; instead this pair had obviously been busy over the past two months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/13/back-in-the-swing-the-simple-joy-of-returning-to-okehamptons-golf-greens">Continue reading...</a>

Because you’d have thought the one thing Boris might have learned from his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/06/keir-starmer-confronts-boris-johnson-for-first-time-during-pmqs-video-highlights">first time up</a> against Keir Starmer at prime minister’s questions last week was that it would be a help to come properly prepared.</p><p>But Boris has never done preparation for anything. It’s not in his nature. Preparation is for girly swots. He is a tabula rasa who treats every day as a new beginning. One free from the consequences of any past actions. He is the macho blagger who has always been able to wing it, fuelled by a few gags and some hasty last-minute revision. Something that might have been good enough, when backed up by a full chamber of braying Tory MPs, to see off Jeremy Corbyn, but that is proving hopelessly inadequate against a top QC in a near-silent courtroom. Things are now so bad that every time Boris opens his mouth, he only encourages the jury to convict him and the judge to increase his sentence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-resorts-to-bluster-under-keir-starmer-cross-examination">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As countries look to ease school and play restrictions, what evidence is there that children react differently?</p><p><strong>How many children are being infected with Covid-19?<br /></strong>Children represent just a small fraction of confirmed Covid-19 cases, with fewer than 2% of reported infections in China, Italy and the United States being in people under 18 years old and with under-18s accounted for fewer than 2% of <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.23.20076042v1.full.pdf">hospital admissions with Covid-19 in the UK</a>.</p><p><strong>Does this mean children are less susceptible?<br /></strong>There is now a wealth of evidence that children generally experience milder symptoms when they are infected – although there have been rare cases of children becoming seriously ill or even dying. However, it is not yet clear whether they have a lower chance of catching Covid-19. Although fewer children have been picked up in national testing programmes, this could be due to fewer being tested. During the early phase of the epidemic in Europe, adult travellers played a dominant role in seeding infections, which also meant, purely for circumstantial reasons, that children would have played a less significant role in spreading infections.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/are-children-less-susceptible-to-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I have joined my club, West Brom, in calling up our older season ticket holders to see how they are getting on. It is a fascinating and moving experience</p><p>If you haven’t already, please do familiarise yourself with the story of a 65-year-old West Bromwich Albion fan called Peter George. All his family’s efforts to bring him around from a coma had failed until they played him a compilation of music associated with our football club. Incredibly, he responded. The club’s charitable foundation then got some of his favourite players to record messages for him, and something approximating a miracle came to pass. He is back at home now.</p><p>This is only a small part of what the club has been up to. A month ago, I got a text from a fellow supporter in Sutton Coldfield. “Just had a call from the Albion to see if Neville and I are OK!” It turned out that the Albion Foundation, West Brom’s charitable arm, were calling all of the club’s season ticket holders over the age of 70. Amanda’s husband is in his 70s, and she answered the phone. As she put it: “Not sure what they’d have offered to do if I’d said we weren’t OK, but it’s the thought that counts.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/may/13/adrian-chiles-west-brom-coronavirus-phone-calls">Continue reading...</a>

Run by the Royal Automobile Club the race was named the “Grand Prix d’Europe, incorporating the British Grand Prix”. With King George VI, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret in attendance some dubbed it “Royal Silverstone” in the hope it would become part of the sporting season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/13/noise-and-smoke-silverstone-f1-blast-off-70-years-go">Continue reading...</a>

No, they said, they <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/northern-ireland-joins-rejection-boris-johnson-stay-alert-slogan">would not be changing the message to the public</a> to “stay alert” in response to the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.

<p>The TV presenter talks about becoming a hypnotherapist, rejecting the labels of sexuality and why lockdown is just like boarding school<br /></p><p>Anna Richardson, dressed in white, shiny dark fringe, peering through the screen of the conference call, reminds me of a wartime poster of a Wren: wholesome but foxy, competent but human, the exact sort of person you want in a national crisis. My dog is in the frame, being an idiot. “If my staffie wasn’t out on a walk, she’d be doing exactly the same thing,” says Richardson. I find this difficult to believe, since my dog is trying to eat a knife, and who else would keep a dog like that? But I have this warm glow of feeling accepted; throughout Richardson’s TV career – she describes it as “factual entertainment” – you can see this coming off everyone she talks to.</p><p>We’re discussing her new show, The Fantastical Factory of Curious Craft, which arrives at a bizarrely apposite time. The concept is that Keith Lemon sets a challenge to some regular people, who happen to be excellent crafters. They might have four hours to create a carnival headdress, for example, which has to have at least four articulated elements. Then in the second part, a celebrity arrives with a peculiar need, perhaps a feature for their garden. And at the end, one person will be chosen to make the garden feature. “It’s similar to Bake Off,” Richardson agrees – of course I’ve brought up Bake Off, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/27/sue-perkins-q-and-a-interview-dance-theme-tune">since </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/oct/27/sue-perkins-q-and-a-interview-dance-theme-tune">her partner, Sue Perkins</a>, presented it for seven series – “in that you don’t have to be a baker or interested in food to get caught up in the storylines.
