You\u2019ve grown comfortable being the world leader for so long now that you view the US as untouchable, that unlike every other empire in the past, the US empire will never fall. But then comes along China. \n\nNo country in history has ever risen so far, so fast, on so many dimensions of power. that it\u2019s starting to make us feel rather insecure - they\u2019re outshining the master! Worst yet, you\u2019re well aware of what\u2019s called Thucydides Trap. Now, besides the people who profit off of war, no one really wants to go to war - it\u2019s such a hassle. War is our nature. So in times like this, in the name of preparedness, Murphy\u2019s law, just as a thought experiment, let\u2019s say we did need to go to war with China - what would that process look like?\n\nThe concept of good fighting evil is so ingrained in us, it\u2019s so primal to us, that if you can activate in people, they\u2019ll go to the ends of the Earth, they\u2019ll do whatever they can to defeat evil. This is the first step in our War Propaganda Machine. They have to believe that they\u2019re the mythological \u201cgood guys,\u201d and their fighting to put an end to those evil, barbarian bad guys.\n\nIf people believe that war is immoral, and that by going war, they\u2019re immoral, they won\u2019t be able to look at themselves in the mirror and will never support it, so you gotta change this perception by making war look like the most moral, altruistic thing we can do in this situation. But most importantly, you have to frame war as the path to peace - that we need to fight to spread democracy and freedom to these poor people enslaved by the Chinese government.\n\nWe need the media to promote our agenda and propaganda while not reporting what we don\u2019t want the public to know about. Sure you\u2019ll have politicians and smaller media outlets here and there that will question the official story, but no one takes them as seriously as a CNN or a New York Times anyways - they\u2019ll be the unpatriotic outsiders. By invoking a sense of good vs evil, by making people feel that they\u2019re on the moral high ground and that the pursuit of peace and democracy justifies war, and by gradually getting that drum beat of battle rising with your pals in the media until that one catalyst event .\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
