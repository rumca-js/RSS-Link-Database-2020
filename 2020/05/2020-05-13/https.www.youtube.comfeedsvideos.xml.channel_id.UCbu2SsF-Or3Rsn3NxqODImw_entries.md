Apex Legends season 5 kicks off with big changes to the Kings Canyon map. Check out this side-by-side comparison to see what's new.

Kings Canyon is the original map for Apex Legends and it's undergone quite a few transformations since the battle royale game released in February 2019. At the start of Season 2: Battle Charge, parts of Kings Canyon had to be rebuilt in the wake of leviathans and flyers invading the arena. That same season also saw Octane and Wraith's town takeovers added to the map. Now, with the start of Season 5: Fortune's Favor, the map has changed once more.

In the video above, we go over all the new changes to Kings Canyon that have now been made with the start of Season 5. New character Loba inadvertently destroyed a portion of Kings Canyon, removing Skull Town and Thunderdome--two of the most popular drop spots on the map. Several other smaller locales are just gone too.

Season 5 doesn't just take locations away--brand-new landmarks have also been added. A huge bowl-like structure, Capacitor, has been placed where Wetlands once stood, for example, and Offshore Rig now connects this new location to both Relay and Swamps.

Several of Kings Canyon's older locations have undergone minor transformations. For the most part, they still have the same layout but they've been altered cosmetically to reflect the passing of time. For instance, Season 1's Shattered Forest (which became Nesting Grounds in Season 2) is now the Reclaimed Forest--and the once bombed-out locale has flourished with green trees and numerous shrubs. 

If you want to see all the changes, you'll have to watch the video. Other than these map changes and Loba, Season 5 adds a host of new content to Apex Legends as detailed in the Fortune's Favor update patch notes. The new season also adds a brand-new battle pass and story-focused PvE Quests mode.

Crusader Kings 3 is just as complex and intricate as the other grand strategy titles coming from Paradox Interactive, but in their new entry to the series the studio has made great strides in making the game more accessible, without sacrificing any of its depth.

Recently Dave Jewitt got access to a preview build of the game, and as a Welsh King, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire, a Viking raider and much more, he got to experiment with the new additions of the game, and how Crusader Kings 3 holds up to other strategy titles in the series.

As well as adding things like knights and new council positions for your in-game spouse, Crusader Kings 3 has increased its focus on its RPG elements, allowing players to craft their character and dynasty with much more freedom than before. 

If you fancy yourself a ruler then you won’t have to wait too long as Crusader Kings 3 releases September 1st 2020.

Epic Games has announced Unreal Engine 5, releasing a nine-minute tech demo that showed a character and her dancing light exploring caves and ruins. The real-time demo illustrated the new engine's two core technologies: Nanite and Lumen, which focus on geometry and lighting, respectively. Tony explains how these are used in the video above.

What's more, Epic Games confirmed that the demo was running on a PS5. It's meant to show off Unreal Engine 5's tech, and although it's not part of a larger game, it is fully playable. Epic simply used a capture device on a PS5 devkit to get the gorgeous footage.

## Apex Legends Season 5 Adds Loba, Buffs Mirage, & More

Season 5 has arrived in Apex Legends, and there are some big changes beyond just new legend Loba. Here's all the important stuff from the patch notes.

Loba is new to the game, but she's far from the only legend with new tricks. Mirage is getting a really big buff, which should totally change the meta for his character. When you release a decoy, you can press the button again to have it mimic every move Mirage makes: before this, the decoy simply ran forward in a straight line. The same goes for Mirage's Ultimate: now all those decoys will mimic his moves too. His Passive gets some special treatment too. You still cloak when you get knocked down, but now you'll also cloak when respawning at a beacon or reviving a teammate--they get the cloaking too. What's more, Mirage's "bamboozle" line will play when a decoy is destroyed, instead of when it gets deployed, which ya know, makes a lot more sense.

Now let's talk Loba. You probably know all about her by now, but if not, here's the important stuff. Her Tactical ability is called Burglar's Best Friend, and it lets her throw her bracelet and teleport to wherever it lands, making it a great ambush tool. Her passive, Eye for Quality, lets her spot Epic and Legendary loot through walls. Then there's her Ultimate, Black Market Boutique. Loba plants her staff in the ground, which pings all loot in the area. Everyone on the team can then check the staff to see a menu similar to a death box, listing all the good stuff nearby. Each squad member can take two pieces of gear for themselves, instantly transferring them to your inventory.

Other legends have been reworked for Season 5 too. These include cooldown and range changes to abilities like Gibraltar's Dome Shield and Bloodhound's Eye of the Allfather. Some of the most significant changes are tied to Caustic's gas canisters: they can't be triggered from the other side of a closed door anymore, and the gas won't slow down Caustic's teammates. GameSpot has the complete list of legend changes.

It's not just the characters that have changed either: Kings Canyon looks quite different now. Skulltown and Thunderdome are gone, with a new location called Salvage along the coast. Wetlands is gone, replaced by the new Capacitor. You'll also find new Charge Towers in Kings Canyon. Activate one, and any legend standing on the platform when the energy burst goes out will instantly have their Ultimate charged and ready to go.

Of course, a new season also means a new battle pass. There's another 100 tiers of rewards to unlock during Season 5, along with an all-new Quest system. Quests are a whole other story, so to learn more about them or anything else in the Season 5 patch notes, head to GameSpot. We'll see you in the Apex Games.

Unreal Engine 5 empowers artists to achieve unprecedented levels of detail and interactivity, and brings these capabilities within practical reach of teams of all sizes through highly productive tools and content libraries.

Also present in the demo are next-gen features already available in Unreal Engine 4.25, such as Niagara VFX improvements, Chaos physics and destruction, animation system enhancements, and audio advancements. Unreal Engine 4.25 also includes support for next-gen consoles.

What happens when you take Mortal Kombat 11’s beautiful graphics and mess them up? Well they become surprisingly delicious as it turns out. That’s what we find out in this week’s episode of Potato Mode.

Potato Mode is a series where we take your favorite games and turn their graphics into mush. We start by showing how good the game can look, and then we turn down the settings as low as we can, and then we go even lower using tools and programs outside of the game. The results are both fascinating and hilarious.

Make sure to come back for part 2 where we check out Mortal Kombat 11’s Aftermath expansion, which features a brand new story mode and new playable characters including Robo Cop. If you’re interested in more videos about Mortal Kombat 11 make sure to check out our written review of the game over on GameSpot.com and the video review on our YouTube channel.
