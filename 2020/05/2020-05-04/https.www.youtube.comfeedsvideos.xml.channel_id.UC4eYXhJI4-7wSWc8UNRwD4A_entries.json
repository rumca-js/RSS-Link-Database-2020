Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nMay 5, 2020 | Suraya Mohamed -- Something special happens when Lianne La Havas performs an acoustic set. Our audience agrees; her first appearance at the Tiny Desk in 2015 is one of the most popular Tiny Desk Concerts of all time. We are thrilled to have her back, this time performing from her home in London.\n\nShe looks quite comfortable in her cozy space. I love the effect of the close camera placement; her essence penetrates the fourth wall like she's singing just for me. Lianne performed the tender \"Paper Thin\" and \"Bittersweet,\" two recent singles that will be included on her self-titled new album set to drop in July. The intimacy of the performance matches the lyrics of the new songs, personal vignettes about her life and growth over the last five years. Also included in the set is \"Midnight,\" a wistful gem from her 2015 album, Blood.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Paper Thin\"\n\"Midnight\"\n\"Bittersweet\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qso4MRfidrw", "date_published": "2020-05-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Mahan Esfahani: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "This performance was recorded on Jan. 29, 2020.

After we wheeled one behind Bob Boilen's desk, it took the bulk of an hour to get the tuning just perfect for the very first Tiny Desk harpsichord recital. Given that our guest was Mahan Esfahani, the instrument's most ardent advocate, we were willing to wait.\n\nEsfahani, who grew up near Washington, D.C., but is now based in Prague, chose a double manual harpsichord \u2014 meaning two keyboards. This one was built by specialists Barbara and Thomas Wolf in 1991, but is based on a famous French instrument from 1770.\n\nThe carefully selected repertoire began with classics: a pair of sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, which share the same key but couldn't be more opposite in personality. With elaborate curlicue ornaments in both hands, the opening sonata presents a sober, regal outlook. Its partner is a flamboyant rocker, with the hands chasing each other across the two keyboards like a cat and mouse.\n\nEsfahani made sure to also include a modern piece. Mel Powell's angular and slightly jazzy \"Recitative and Toccata Percossa,\" from 1951, is a tour de force in this artist's hands. It drives home a point he likes to make \u2014 that while the harpsichord had its heyday in the 18th century, it's still a vibrant instrument and very much alive. \"There are over 50 modern concertos for the harpsichord,\" he told the audience.\n\nReturning to the baroque, Esfahani closed with a little-known chaconne by Johann Pachelbel. Its steady bassline and colorful variations were a pleasant reminder of the composer's one-hit claim to fame, \"Pachelbel's Canon.\" Although the music stopped there, Esfahani's performance continued as he stayed for a while behind the desk, happily regaling the harpsichord-curious on the finer points of the instrument.\n\nSET LIST\nDomenico Scarlatti: \"Sonata in D, K. 534\"\nDomenico Scarlatti: \"Sonata in D, K. 535\"\nMel Powell: \"Recitative and Toccata Percossa\"\nJohann Pachelbel: \"Chaconne\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMahan Esfahani: harpsichord\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Tom Huizenga, Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Melany Rochester, Shanti Hands; Editor: Melany Rochester; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Kisha Ravi/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMsTJo9yxGA", "date_published": "2020-05-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
