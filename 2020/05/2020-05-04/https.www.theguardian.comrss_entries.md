If you are positive, you do them to monitor your HIV status. If you are negative and on PrEP, a daily medication that helps prevent HIV, you do them to ensure it’s working. If you are negative and not on PrEP, you do them to maintain your sanity. Every gay person has their own rhythm to testing, defined by their relationship to HIV, their sexual practices and their neuroses. No matter your status, waiting for test results is never easy. You count the minutes until you hear via text, in person, over the phone, in an app: your body is OK for now.</p><p>It won’t end until there is a cure. What we have right now is management. Since around 1980, when the first cases were identified in the US, 700,000 people have died of Aids. In my lifetime, it went from an epidemic with no cure to one for which we have the tools to at least approximate herd immunity. People still die. There are no certainties.

<p>The founder of Hashtag United, Spencer Owen, and Basildon captain, Alex Bailess, discuss how they came to join forces</p><p>It feels like “a reward for how hard we’ve worked”, says AFC Basildon’s captain, Alex Bailess, on the team being taken under the wing of the YouTube sensations Hashtag United. “There was a time when the club was literally hours from folding, with no committee, no funding and loads of players had left. Every year we wonder whether we are going to make it through the next season and what the funding is going to be like. It’s just been quite uncertain.”</p><p>For the uninitiated, in 2016 Hashtag United was converted from a ramshackle seven-a-side team to a team that would compete on YouTube for all to see. The founder Spencer Owen would arrange for the matches, played against staff teams of professional clubs and Sunday league and non-league teams, to be filmed and uploaded to the website. Win a certain number of games and there would be promotion in a fictional league. Now, they have almost half a million subscribers on YouTube and Instagram, close to 200,000 followers on Twitter as well as a men’s team playing more formally in the tier-nine Essex Senior League.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/04/hours-from-folding-how-afc-basildon-became-hashtag-united-women-fc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The five-times Olympic champion is now in charge of China’s rowers but his main concern during Covid-19 crisis is not more medals</p><p>“My eldest daughter is a plastic surgeon but she’s been drawn back into hospital medicine because there’s no surgery going on,” Sir Steve Redgrave says as he explains why the Covid-19 crisis has had such a personal impact. “Natalie’s on the frontline. She’s working nights on the Covid ward. She’s 28, healthy, but you hear of many medics and support staff losing their lives. Of course, as a father, you feel very upset.”</p><p>Redgrave won <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2011/dec/07/50-stunning-moments-steve-redgrave">five gold medals </a>as a rower at five successive Olympic Games from 1984 to 2000.

<p>The footballer-turned-television presenter on the educational benefits of 90 Day Fiancé, and why watching his own gameshow makes him emotional</p><p>I’ve been spending my lockdown watching 90 Day Fiancé (TLC) with my partner. It’s very exciting, humorous and real. I love that the couples have never met each other before but are prepared to get married almost straight away – it’s such a simple but entertaining premise. They are all just random people from all over the world trying to make love work, which as most people know is not easy. Trying to fall in love with somebody you have never met in your life is almost impossible so all the couples are fascinating to watch. At the end of the day, very few of them make it.</p><p>It’s a lesson to all of us to find someone who really knows you, because if there is distance in a marriage it just won’t function. As much as it is very funny and the couples have lots of arguments though, this is real life and it is often how marriages are. A marriage can be full of disagreements, or it might be that you don’t have love and you only got married because you were looking for something. It is almost educational for myself and my partner, since I have been married once and divorced, so when you go into it a second time, you want to make sure you know what you want.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/04/i-love-presenting-nigerias-deal-or-no-deal-john-fashanus-lockdown-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Knowing how much salt to add, and when, is an under-rated skill. See how it transforms a simple spring soup</p><p>With its flared top, funnelled length, high heel and spur, Italy is unmistakably a thigh-high boot. It becomes a knee-high boot if you cut it in half, following a line from Rome on the Tyrrhenian coast, to Porto d’Ascoli on the Adriatic one, which is pretty much what the <a href="https://www.lifeinitaly.com/historic-roads/salaria">Via Salaria</a> does, give or take the odd curve.</p><p>The original imprint of the road predates the foundation of Rome, and was the work of an ancient population of settlers and warriors called <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabines">Sabini</a></em>. These early routes were created gradually, bit by bit, to move supplies between settlements – the most important of which was <em>sal,</em> salt, produced in salt pans on both coasts from both oceans. Under the Romans, these became the first consular routes and were named – purposefully – Via Salaria. Those marching along the Salt Road were often paid with the valuable substance they transported, which is where the Latin <em>salarium –</em> salary – comes from. Also, the idea of salt as worth and wisdom. Things done <em>cum grano salis,</em> with a grain of salt, are done discerningly, as opposed to foolishly because you have no salt in your head, or in your soup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/04/rachel-roddy-courgette-cannellini-bean-herb-soup-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

He scanned the headline, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/01/karl-ove-knausgaard-interview-shame-dancing-in-the-dark">Writing is a way of getting rid of shame</a>”, and tossed it to me across the breakfast table, saying: “Looks like something for you.”</p><p>I had at that time begun to write essays, which I hoped were literary in style but which felt cripplingly, humiliatingly feminine in their subject matter – unlovely accounts of abortion and sexual jealousy, and the abjection of being a woman who desires men. I was struggling towards something, an avoidance of villains and heroes, victors and losers, and a rejection of the idea that female pain was pretty or somehow inherently virtuous. I had the feeling that there was something there worth striving toward, but the embarrassment and, yes, the shame, was holding me back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/04/writing-shameful-feminine-karl-ove-knausgard-my-struggle-writing">Continue reading...</a>

When China first alerted the World Health Organization about a novel coronavirus on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-100-days-that-changed-the-world">31 December</a>, the countdown began for countries to each prepare.

Others, such as the UK and US, consumed with domestic political issues, watched and waited, anticipating that this new virus would be more similar to a bad flu strain.</p><p>We are now almost four months into this pandemic, and the lessons that can be drawn from east Asian countries on how best to control this coronavirus and keep daily new cases as low as possible are clear.

<p>From a simple but tasty porridge to an Indian omelette, here are some great reasons to get out of bed in the morning<strong><br /></strong><br /></p><p>Breakfast used to be the easiest meal of the day. Everyone ate whatever they had time for (which, on a regular day, would be toast or nothing). None of us had to think too much, because even if you didn’t stay full until lunch time, you would probably be working and have to wait to take your break. Now that there is nothing to stop any of us eating all day long, this needs a little more thought.</p><p>The new logistics are baffling. I feel like I am running a haulage company. If everyone in the household eats when they wake up, you will have cleared up the kitchen five times before lunch. This is insane; you might as well mill your own flour. Ideally, you want to wait until the last person is hungry, which is around 11.30am. Perfect: you have rolled breakfast into lunch, and now you only have two avalanches of dishes to worry about. But now the breakfast has to be good: nobody is going to wait until 11.30 for cornflakes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/04/brilliant-breakfasts-10-delicious-healthy-ways-to-start-day">Continue reading...</a>

But even if the government had locked down sooner, many never stood a chance. The poor, the underpaid and the disempowered have neither the labour rights nor the ability to protect themselves from the virus by self-isolating or defying employers who have not extended sufficient protection.
