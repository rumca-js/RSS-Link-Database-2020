During heatwaves, or a bad season of influenza, additional deaths above what would be normally seen in the population fit this description. Harvesting usually affects older people and those who are already sick. Generally, it is viewed as a tragic, unfortunate, but largely unpreventable consequence of natural events. It carries with it connotations of an acceptable loss of life. It is, in a sense, what happens as part of a normal life in normal times. But the word also has darker connotations: those of sacrifice, reaping, culling. As such, while it may appear in textbooks of epidemiology, it doesn\u2019t occur in national influenza strategic plans or national discourse. The concept of harvesting is restricted to epidemiological circles.</p><p>But what if politicians promote the notion of harvesting (while declining to use the term) where it is not a \u201cnatural\u201d consequence of events but a direct consequence of government policy? What if the medical and nursing world do <em>not</em> accept harvesting in these circumstances? What if a policy that results in harvesting cannot be articulated because it is unacceptable to the broader population? This is where we have got to with the coronavirus pandemic. Nowhere better exemplifies this tension between a policy and its popular acceptance than the effects of coronavirus in nursing homes.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-home-residents-harvested-left-to-die-uk-government-herd-immunity\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-home-residents-harvested-left-to-die-uk-government-herd-immunity", "date_published": "2020-05-08 11:00:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How are you marking the 75th anniversary of VE Day in lockdown?", "description": "<p>We\u2019d like to hear from people about how you\u2019re remembering the anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe </p><p>Friday 8 May will mark 75 years since the end of the Second World War in Europe.
