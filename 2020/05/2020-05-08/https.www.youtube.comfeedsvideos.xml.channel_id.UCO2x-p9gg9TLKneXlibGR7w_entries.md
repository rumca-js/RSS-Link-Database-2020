Jailbroken users have always been able to take advantage of emulation which was not otherwise possible due to Apple's App Store restrictions. Not anymore! You can use your own AppleID to sign 3rd party apps to your device to use DolphiniOS to play your favorite GameCube and Wii games. You can even use MFi, Xbox, and PS4 controllers on iOS!
