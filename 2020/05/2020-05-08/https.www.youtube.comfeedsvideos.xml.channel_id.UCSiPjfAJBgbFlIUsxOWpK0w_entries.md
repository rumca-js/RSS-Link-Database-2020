LYRICS

Can lead a horse to the water
But you can’t make it moo
(Can’t make it moo)
And you can put all the butter
That you want on your food
(All the butter, all of the butter)
So if your head’s getting cluttered
By your delicate mood
Come out
Come out
Come outside
Where the light
Is kinder than you knew
It’s time to let loose
It’s time to let loose  

I really like what you do
(Like what you do)
(Shake it shake it)
I wanna try somethin’ new
(Try somethin’ new)

Well you can bite off the bottom
But you’re breakin’ the rules
(Breakin’ the rules)
And you can play at the lotto when
The numbers are good
(All the numbers, all of the numbers)
But if you break it you buy it
And you know that you should
Come out
Come out
Come outside
Where the light
Is kinder than you knew
It’s time to let loose
It’s time to let loose
