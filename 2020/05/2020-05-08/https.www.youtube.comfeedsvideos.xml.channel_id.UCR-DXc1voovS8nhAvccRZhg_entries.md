In this video, I show how to build the hardware for a Raspberry Pi Cluster, and how to flash microSD cards or the eMMC storage built into a Raspberry Pi Compute Module.

I compare the experience of building the hardware for a traditional Raspberry Pi model B cluster versus building a Turing Pi cluster with Compute Modules.

I also explore why it takes a little extra work to flash a Compute Module's eMMC storage, but why it's worth doing it.
