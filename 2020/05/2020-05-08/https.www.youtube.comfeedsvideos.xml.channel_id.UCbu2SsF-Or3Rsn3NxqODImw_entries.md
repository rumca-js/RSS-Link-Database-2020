The Xbox Series X is releasing this year and here are the games confirmed so far for Microsoft's console including Halo Infinite, Cyberpunk 2077, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla. 

Quite a few games have been announced for the next-generation consoles, Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5--enough to start compiling a list. In the video above, Jordan Ramée details all of the games currently scheduled to release for Xbox Series X.

For the most part, the video lists all of the games in alphabetical order. Without release dates for most of the games coming to next-gen systems, it's a little too difficult to list them out in the order you'll be able to play them. 

In total, there are 30 games currently scheduled to release on Xbox Series X. Some are re-releases of games-as-a-service titles, like Rainbow Six Siege and Warframe, while others are brand-new games, such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077. It's not all AAA games, either--there are a few indie games already confirmed for Xbox Series X, like Call of the Sea and Chorus.

The video only covers games confirmed to release or launch on Xbox Series X--games like Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI are left off. Given how far off games like that are, they'll most likely release on next-generation consoles like Xbox Series X, but we don't know that for sure yet.

This week on Good News Gaming, we take a look at an incredible gesture from the Fallout 76 community, as well as the canceled Prince of Persia game that somehow surfaced on YouTube this week… after being uploaded eight years ago. We also enjoy a fake Nintendo Direct, and catch up with Greg Miller's fundraising efforts.

On this episode of Good News Gaming, we take a look at the footage of a canceled Prince of Persia game that's been making the rounds online this week, even though it was uploaded… eight years ago. We also cover an incredible gesture from the Fallout 76 community, which has rallied to help out one of its most famous role-players in their time of need. 

We also delve into that fake Animal Crossing Direct (and hope that Nintendo is taking notes), as well as watch a very good video essay about horror game soundtracks. There's a couple of excellent memes and funny gaming moments thrown in for good measure. 

As always, if you have any uplifting news stories you'd like to see mentioned next week, leave them in the comments!

## The Dumb Sh*t We Do In Video Games

Video games may often have an intended way of playing them, but that doesn't mean we always do so. GameSpot's staff looks back on how we've broken the rules in our favorite video games, and simply just played them how we wanted to.

Sometimes playing a video game is more than just our experiences following their stories and completing everything we're tasked to do. Whether the game wants us to or not, we always find opportunities to go off the rails and spend countless hours engaging in all manner of ridiculous behavior just for the fun of it. The GameSpot staff has done some pretty dumb stuff in games in our time, and we're willing to bet you have too. 

In the video above, we recount some of our fondest memories, both old and new, spent either trying to break a game's rules or just engaging in a funny activity we made up when we were bored. Our experiences run the spectrum of games, which includesThe Sims, GTA: Vice City, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Street Fighter II.

What dumb things do you do in games? Share with us in the comments below! And if you're a fan of hearing our experiences, be sure to let us know that too, as we'd love to make more videos around this subject. After all, the four stories above are only a handful of the many the folks at GameSpot still have to tell!

Today, Persia highlights some stand-out moments from Inside Xbox. The highly anticipated Assassin's Creed Valhalla gameplay trailer was revealed but showed more environmental gameplay than combat. We'll have to wait a bit longer for more in-depth gameplay to be shown. We did learn that Valhalla will have Smart Delivery support alongside many other titles. 

Two new horror games were announced for the Xbox Series X. First is from Bloober Team, the developers behind Blair Witch and Observation are teaming up with Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka for a new horror game called The Medium. Second is Scorn, which is a metroidvania-inspired horror game with heavy art inspiration from H.R. Giger. 

Codemaster's rally racing game is back. Dirt 5 was announced and showed off many new elements to make every race unique, such as a day-night cycle and various weather patterns. 

Super Bowl Champion and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes made an appearance on stream today to talk about Madden 21, it's new "feel for the field" and its Smart Delivery Support.

This is your Save State for Thursday, May 7th.

The Call of Duty series has featured some iconic weapons through it’s lifetime, and players both old and new have their favourites and ones they consider the best. 

And while in 2020 new weapons are constantly being added through Call of Duty: Modern Warfare’s seasons, and patches, nerfs and buffs keep changing the stats of many of our favourite guns there will always be stand out greats in the arsenal of our favourite games.

From Modern Warfare 2’s ACR, to World at War’s MP40 and even the best of the bunch in the armour of Modern Warfare 2019, these are the best weapons (in Dave’s opinion) in the history of Call of Duty.

Our initial reactions to Xbox 20/20 are pretty mixed so far. Though the May 2020 Inside Xbox presentation showcased some pretty cool games, the livestream didn't feature the collection of gameplay clips and walkthroughs we were expecting from Microsoft.

In the video above--which is a breakout form GameSpot After Dark Episode 40--Jake Dekker sits down with Lucy James, Kallie Plagge, and Tamoor Hussain to discuss the first part of Microsoft's Summer 2020 plan to market Xbox Series X. During the conversation, the four touch on all of the games revealed during the May 2020 Inside Xbox livestream, which are listed below.

Chorus
