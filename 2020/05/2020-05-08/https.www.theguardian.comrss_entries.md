By rights, marking the 75<sup>th</sup> anniversary of VE Day in the midst of a pandemic that has confined us to our homes – forcing us to keep our distance from one another, denying us the right to gather in crowds – should have muffled this commemoration. A celebration in private would surely feel like no celebration at all. Katherine Jenkins singing to an empty Albert Hall, streets with no street parties and the pubs all shut: how could that add up to anything other than a damp squib?</p><p>And yet Friday’s marking of the end of the second world war struck a deeper chord than it might, had it been just another sunny bank holiday. Yes, the usual rituals had to be suspended. There could be no wreath-laying at local memorials; instead, Prince Charles and Camilla laid two small wreaths on their own, in a crowdless corner of Balmoral, watched by a lone piper. There could be<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/alone-with-union-jack-ve-day-veterans-90s-miss-out"> no veterans’ parades</a>, no reunions for those who had served, no grateful handshakes from the politicians: 102-year-old former staff sergeant Ernie Horsfall had to make do with a Zoom call from Boris Johnson.

<p>75 years ago, after five years during which the weather outlook was an official secret, the British public got a forecast</p><p>Exactly 75 years ago, for the first time in five years, the British people were treated to a weather forecast. The war in Europe had ended and weather prospects were no longer an official secret. The Met Office, an arm of the War Office, was so <a href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/metofficegovuk/pdf/research/library-and-archive/library/publications/factsheets/remember_world-war-one-and-two.pdf">strategically important</a> that at the outbreak of hostilities it was moved out of London to protect it from bombing.</p><p>In heavily camouflaged huts, forecasters set up on Dunstable Downs, Bedfordshire, and were linked to Q Central, the British war communications centre at nearby Leighton Buzzard. Throughout WWII until VE Day, via Q Central, forecasters receiving reports from many sources, including British ships crossing the Atlantic, produced updated weather forecasts as frequently as every half hour. The accuracy of these was vital to inform military operations – most famously D-Day, but more usually, for the RAF – details of cloud cover to aid the defence of Britain and later for Allied bombing raids.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/08/weatherwatch-and-at-last-here-is-the-weather-forecast">Continue reading...</a>

Ahmaud was born on 8 May 1994 and would have turned 26 on Friday.</p><p>The idea for a global run in Arbery’s name came from his high school football coach, Jason Vaughn, who last saw Arbery when they crossed paths on a run. Arbery loved running.

The sudden shift to a more “westernised” way of running the economy left many impoverished, which was eventually capitalised on – after the oligarchic power wars – by a new political leader who embraced a conservative, nationalist rhetoric: Vladimir Putin.</p><p>Today, Russian television presenters feed us stories about a European continent in decay, where “aggressive migrants” run amok, where social services take children away from their parents for being “slapped”, where “sexual minorities” destroy traditional families. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/08/europeans-russians-together-anti-facism">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Harvesting' is a terrible word – but it's what has happened in Britain's care homes | Richard Coker

<p>Epidemiologists use the term to describe tragic excess deaths – but for Covid-19 it seems to be the de facto government policy</p><p>There’s a term we use in epidemiology to capture the essence of increases in deaths, or excess mortality, above and beyond normal expectations: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19056405">“harvesting”</a>. During heatwaves, or a bad season of influenza, additional deaths above what would be normally seen in the population fit this description. Harvesting usually affects older people and those who are already sick. Generally, it is viewed as a tragic, unfortunate, but largely unpreventable consequence of natural events. It carries with it connotations of an acceptable loss of life. It is, in a sense, what happens as part of a normal life in normal times. But the word also has darker connotations: those of sacrifice, reaping, culling. As such, while it may appear in textbooks of epidemiology, it doesn’t occur in national influenza strategic plans or national discourse. The concept of harvesting is restricted to epidemiological circles.</p><p>But what if politicians promote the notion of harvesting (while declining to use the term) where it is not a “natural” consequence of events but a direct consequence of government policy? What if the medical and nursing world do <em>not</em> accept harvesting in these circumstances? What if a policy that results in harvesting cannot be articulated because it is unacceptable to the broader population? This is where we have got to with the coronavirus pandemic. Nowhere better exemplifies this tension between a policy and its popular acceptance than the effects of coronavirus in nursing homes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/care-home-residents-harvested-left-to-die-uk-government-herd-immunity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My immediate reaction was fear. I bent down and shouted at him. He bolted upright, spluttering and looking a bit wild</p><p>It was early on a Monday morning, about 5.30am, and I’d got up to use the toilet. Afterwards, I nipped into the kitchen to get a drink. As I stood at the sink, I could hear snoring from the living room. At first I thought it was the dog. Then I realised it wasn’t. I went into the room to find a stranger asleep on the sofa. He was wearing a grey Adidas tracksuit and, bizarrely, only one shoe. I stood there in my shorts and T-shirt, staring at him.</p><p>My immediate reaction was fear. I live in a modern block of four flats on a busy road in Kilmarnock, about 20 miles south of Glasgow. The main door to the block is a buzzer-entry, secure entrance.

<p>‘Being locked away has permitted many of us to eat without the annual creeping tyranny of how we should look in time for summer’</p><p>Although many Brits stampeded into the supermarkets in late March, in the fear that we were going to starve due to food shortages, by May some of us have found that the opposite is the case. Pulling, or rather heaving, on my Lycra this week, I noted that, in profile, I resembled a snugly stuffed Cumberland sausage, perhaps because my lockdown stash of “delicious things bought to sit out dystopia” – <a href="https://www.bahlsen.co.uk/products/bahlsen/choco-leibniz">Choco Leibniz biscuits</a>, Doritos, <a href="https://www.batchelorsrange.co.uk/">Super Noodles</a>, tinned macaroni cheese – is now somewhat depleted. I’ve observed the government’s Stay At Home mantra obediently, with a mere 160 steps in 24 hours being my personal best so far. Not one single, non-essential journey did I make that day, other than a mooch to the kitchen to graze subliminally on delicious, non-perishable items that I’d bought to see me through the end of the world. Dystopia, I reckoned, calls for stuff you can eat with one hand while sat on your roof waving to the army to pick you up. That’s why I had, albeit temporarily, an eight-pack of <a href="https://www.jacobs.co.uk/products/mini-cheddars/">Mini Cheddars</a>.</p><p>Dystopia, however, did not come. Or at least not how I’d envisioned it. In its place there’s a relentless drip of disconcerting news: redundancies, recession and, of course, the endless dying. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/matt-hancock">Matt Hancock</a>’s press briefings, I’ve found, go well with small mug of <a href="https://www.baileys.com/en-gb/">Baileys</a> and perhaps a finger or two of Highland shortbread. And during week five, when I stopped replying to WhatsApp messages because I had run out of words to say, I ate no actual meals at all. Just lots of semi-pacifying things: fistfuls of Kellogg’s Krave straight out of the packet, the last of the marzipan Christmas tree decorations… Subliminal grazing. Life is short, so have a KitKat. The feeling of my thumbnail sliding through the silver paper was ever so comforting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/08/if-god-wanted-me-to-be-a-size-eight-would-he-have-made-birds-eye-potato-waffles-so-waffly-versatile-grace-dent-food">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I’ve heard of women rejecting a guy for his size, then making fun of him to others’</p><p>I was 15 when I realised my penis was below average in size. Feeling increasingly ashamed, I gravitated towards humiliation pornography (in which women demean men over their size) and that only made me focus more on my anxieties. I used to upload pictures of my penis anonymously on to sites such as Reddit, and the comments were all about how small it was.</p><p><br />I’m 22 now, and have never had a girlfriend, which I attribute to my low self-esteem. I think that in a loving relationship you accept each other’s faults – that is what I’d try to do – but I’ve heard stories of women rejecting a guy for his size and then making fun of him to other people. I’ve asked out a female friend or two while drunk, but always been rejected. Hell, I’d have rejected myself – I have overeating issues, an introverted personality, no banter. There are a million factors, but I can’t help tying them all up with having a small penis. I used to blame my inability to date on anyone but me, and for a while I gravitated towards <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/25/woman-who-invented-incel-movement-interview-toronto-attack">incel</a> [involuntary celibate] groups, but I soon realised that their ideology is toxic.

<p><strong> (Air Texture)</strong><br />Shuffling Mestizo melodies meet eerie techno in this stellar compilation taken from Ecuador’s pulsating club scene</p><p>While most would name Colombia as the home of South America’s forward-thinking club scene, neighbouring Ecuador has quietly been carving out its own dancefloor identity in recent years. The country has produced breakout talents such as DJ Nicola Cruz and home-grown labels like ZZK and Wonderwheel Recordings, operating under the social restrictions of a largely Catholic state and in the midst of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/03/ecuador-state-of-emergency-fuel-subsidies-protest">devastating austerity</a> measures. Most of its key players reside in Quito, and bring together a community at the capital’s inclusive nights, including Cruz’s La Sagraria.</p><p>Often marked by downtempo, undulating house rhythms and samples of Andean pan flutes and instruments such as the lute-like <em>charango</em>, their output is organic-sounding. Yet Place: Ecuador, a new charity compilation, showcases a grittier and more kinetic side to the scene. It’s the fourth release in New York label Air Texture’s location-specific charity series (previous editions have covered Georgia, Colombia and the Netherlands), benefiting the indigenous Waorani people’s legal battles against the Ecuadorian government’s sale of their land for mineral rights.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/08/place-ecuador-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From avant-garde fashion with Vivienne Westwood to the Sex Pistols to hip-hop … Paul Gorman pins down the talents of a disruptive visionary </p><p>“To be bad is good, because to be good is simply boring,” the formidable Rose Corré Isaacs would tell her grandson, Malcolm McLaren, a mantra that he would live by. As Paul Gorman’s mammoth biography illustrates, McLaren was never boring, but he could be a dreadful pain in the arse.</p><p><em>The Life and Times of Malcolm McLaren</em> details the wild existence of the late artist, fashion impresario, music manager and film-maker, who is variously described here as a “psychotic visionary”, a “genius”, a “conman” and, according to Sex Pistol <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/feb/15/john-lydon-i-didnt-want-to-be-a-comfortable-mick-jagger-type-naughty-pop-star">John Lydon</a>, “the most evil man on earth”. His story spans art school in the 1960s, punk in the 70s, hip-hop and a spell in Los Angeles in the 80s, a failed 2000 bid to become mayor of London and his final years giving theatrical public lectures and exhibiting his art. In his author’s note, Gorman explains his approach, which involved going through a previously unseen cache of papers left by McLaren’s father, Peter, along with talking to anyone who ever crossed Malcolm’s path, barring his ex-partner Vivienne Westwood and their son, Joe Corré, both of whom, he notes crisply, “have had their say about him multiple times”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/08/the-life-and-times-of-malcolm-mclaren-review-fallouts-and-fabulous-disasters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Spurs’ former scout David Webb tells the story of how four supremely shrewd acquisitions helped take the team to the Champions League final<br /></p><p>The anniversary falls on Friday. In the second extraordinary semi-final comeback in as many days, Tottenham overcame Ajax courtesy of a 96th-minute winner from their most recent recruit. A year and a half into his Spurs career, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/08/ajax-tottenham-champions-league-semi-final-match-report-moura">Lucas Moura completed his hat-trick</a>. It was an advertisement for enforced continuity, an antidote to the obsession with spending as the only team in the top five European leagues to go through the season without signing anyone became Champions League finalists.</p><p>But it was not entirely true to call Tottenham the team without transfers. There was a golden age of recruitment under Mauricio Pochettino: not in 2018-19, but a seven-month spell in 2015 when Spurs brought in Dele Alli, Son Heung-min, Kieran Trippier and Toby Alderweireld all for less than £45m. Four years, and four top-four finishes later, each of a quartet which could have been valued at a combined £250m started the Champions League final.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/08/peak-pochettino-how-a-golden-age-of-recruitment-transformed-tottenham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I remember the euphoria of 8 May 1945, and the push for a fairer society that followed. The parallels today are striking<br /></p><p>The world I grew up in was always circumscribed by war: I was five years old when it began, and it was all I knew. There were lots of rules. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/nov/01/blackout-britain-wartime">The world was black</a> – no chinks of light from curtains, or someone would come knocking; no street lights, shop windows, tiny hand torches to find your way. Just total blackness, so the bombers wouldn’t see.</p><p>They came anyway, lighting up the sky as our nearest city, Manchester, burned. We would huddle safe in our underground shelter, grabbed from my bed in the dark by my father, nestled among soil and spiders. As I grew older we played hiding from Germans in the wheatfields, and swapped pieces of fallen shrapnel. We were aware of mysterious worried chatter among the grownups. My father’s Home Guard rifle stood in the hall.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/ve-day-coronavirus-1945">Continue reading...</a>

That’s why it is essential that intelligence agencies remain aloof, not only from the political debates of the day, but also from the policy decisions that individual governments may take.
