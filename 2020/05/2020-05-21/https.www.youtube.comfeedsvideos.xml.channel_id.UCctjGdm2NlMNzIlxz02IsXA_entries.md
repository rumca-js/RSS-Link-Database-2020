The Deer Woman on Twitch's Safety Advisory Council recently came under fire for arguing that voice chat makes competitive play unfair. Does she have a point?

And while it's easy to poke fun at the deer girl for obvious reasons, I wanted to actually look at what her argument actually is, and in doing so perhaps share with you the beautiful brutality of voice chat and the post game lobby.
