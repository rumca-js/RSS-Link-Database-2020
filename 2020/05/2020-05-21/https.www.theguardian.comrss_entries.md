<p>Horizon’s respectful and sensitive look at the comedian’s life and struggles with addiction is a beacon of the genre</p><p>In the end, any documentary about mental health is essentially an excavation of layers of pain. Whether that is an inherently exploitative act is arguable and should always be debated, before embarking on either the making or the watching of it. After that, the programme must be judged on how carefully and respectfully it uncovers – or lets the subject uncover – their layers and how successfully it resists the temptation to push the narrative along, faster or further than the subject at its centre seems happy with. By those standards, Horizon’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jbcf">What’s the Matter with Tony Slattery?</a> (BBC Two) was a beacon for the genre.</p><p>Like most of us who came of age in the late 80s and early 90s, I remember Slattery best for his charm, wit, improvisational talent and lovely, impish face on the Channel 4 hit <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/whose-line-is-it-anyway">Whose Line Is It Anyway?</a> For a while, he was everywhere – panel shows, adverts, presenting award ceremonies and so on – and seemed to be having a fine old time of it. Behind the scenes, however, the wheels started coming off and a few years later he withdrew from the public eye into a welter of drink, drugs and depression, where he has remained, more or less, for the last 25 years. He no longer takes drugs but he still drinks too much and cannot find equilibrium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/21/whats-the-matter-with-tony-slattery-review-a-moving-study-of-drink-depression-and-abuse">Continue reading...</a>

It was entirely right for people from overseas working in the NHS and social care sectors to pay a £624 visa surcharge to use the NHS themselves. After all, if they were going to come over here and try to save people’s lives – the prime minister’s included – then they ought to pay for the privilege. It was just common sense. People working on the front line were far more likely to get coronavirus, so they could well end up using NHS resources that should have been available to hardworking Brits who wouldn’t dream of doing such a highly skilled job for so little money.

Doja Cat, Ariana Grande, Camila Cabello, Cardi B, Kehlani, Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé – almost all women of colour – “have had number ones with songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating etc”, Del Rey wrote. “Can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money, or whatever I want – without being crucified or saying that I’m glamorising abuse?</p><p>“Anyways,” she wrote after several more paragraphs of bile further directed at the critics she says have accused her of glamorising abuse, “none of this has anything to do about much.” On the second page of her Instagram post of a text screenshot, she shrugged out the fact that she is releasing a new album and two books of poetry later this year. There it is. Female pop stars regularly criticise the media pitting them against one another to sell magazines and drive clicks. It’s depressing to see a critically acclaimed musician exploit that dynamic, mobilising those artists’ noisy fanbases for publicity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/21/lana-del-rey-criticising-peers-undermines-feminist-argument">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson’s necessary U-turn on NHS fees for overseas health and care workers reveals a leader who is no longer in control of policy</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/21/uk-coronavirus-live-news-update-covid-test-and-trace-second-wave#block-5ec6ac9f8f0864e579f15566">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The first <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/20/mps-expected-approve-plans-virtual-parliament" title="">virtual proceedings</a> of the House of Commons began on 21 April as a result of the national lockdown. They have lasted for a month. The system was brought to a peremptory halt this week by the leader of the house, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/unions-set-to-clash-with-rees-mogg-over-call-to-end-virtual-parliament" title="">Jacob Rees-Mogg</a>. When the Commons returns on 2 June, MPs will no longer be allowed to take part in proceedings from their homes. Electronic voting, which began on 12 May, will <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/news/2020/may/ministers-questioned-on-continuation-of-hybrid-proceedings-after-recess/" title="">come to an end</a> too. The ending of the virtual Commons is in reality intended to bring an increasingly awkward parliament back to heel. But it could easily have the opposite effect.</p><p>Mr Rees-Mogg has done all this because Boris Johnson’s government is much more rattled by the politics of Covid-19 than it lets on. The prime minister’s handling of coronavirus issues on television and in parliament has been shabby. He has been bettered by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/bombastic-boris-meets-his-match-in-forensic-starmer-at-pmqs" title="">Keir Starmer</a> at prime minister’s questions. He has now been forced into a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/johnson-forced-to-drop-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers" title="">U-turn on fees for overseas health workers</a> that he had defended against Mr Starmer only on Wednesday. He has been outshone in his approach to easing the lockdown by Nicola Sturgeon in <a href="https://www.gov.scot/binaries/content/documents/govscot/publications/strategy-plan/2020/05/coronavirus-covid-19-framework-decision-making-scotlands-route-map-through-out-crisis/documents/covid-19-framework-decision-making-scotlands-route-map-through-out-crisis/covid-19-framework-decision-making-scotlands-route-map-through-out-crisis/govscot%3Adocument/covid-19-framework-decision-making-scotlands-route-map-through-out-crisis.pdf" title="">Scotland</a>, Mark Drakeford in <a href="https://gov.wales/sites/default/files/publications/2020-05/unlocking-our-society-and-economy-continuing-the-conversation.pdf" title="">Wales</a> and Arlene Foster in <a href="https://www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/execoffice/execuitveour-approach-to-decision-making.pdf" title="">Northern Ireland</a>. When his party, and even the country, has needed him to rise to the occasion, he has been out of sight and let unimpressive lieutenants face the music. Unsurprisingly, his ratings have fallen.

<p>Whether you harvest it non-alcoholic or leave it to become boozy over several months, home-brewed mead is a millennia-old tradition</p><p>Mead, which dates back to 5000 BC, is thought to be the world’s oldest fermented drink. There’s speculation it was discovered by accident in the hollow of a tree, where a little honey and some rainwater that had collected, stagnated and fermented spontaneously.</p><p>Mead is made from water and honey, and ferments thanks to the endogenous yeasts that occur naturally in honey. The taste is honeyed and lightly alcoholic – people often think of mead as a highly alcoholic drink, but it doesn’t have to be. It depends on the length of time it is left to ferment. <br /><br />Here are two of our favourite versions: a sweet, young, fizzy and non-alcoholic mead that’s like Ethiopian tej, and a drier, more alcoholic mead that requires a little longer to ferment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/22/honey-pot-how-to-brew-mead-at-home">Continue reading...</a>

For the first few weeks it was brilliant, until the novelty started to wear off.</p><p>The pandemic has made me realise how much students take teachers for granted. Now, if I’m stuck on a piece of work, I can’t just put up my hand and ask for help. I enjoy school, but I’m not the brainiest kid in the class, and not being able to get an instant response has been one of the hardest challenges.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/21/lockdown-from-a-teens-perspective">Continue reading...</a>

<p>ESPN’s new film on the cyclist is a compelling study in the corruption of the male athletic ego</p><p>“It’s a miracle I’m not a mass murderer,” Lance Armstrong, reflecting on his mother Linda’s laissez-faire approach to parenting, muses in the opening scenes of Lance, the new two-part ESPN documentary whose first half screens in the US on Sunday night.</p><p>In the 10 minutes that follow, the director, Marina Zenovich, assembles a tableau of reminiscences that make that shocking admission seem somehow understandable. We see Armstrong’s stepfather, Terry Armstrong, claim: “Lance would not be the champion he is today without me, because I drove him. I drove him like an animal.” (“He beat the shit out of me,” Lance recalls.) We hear Armstrong explaining how he forged his birth certificate to pass himself off as a 16-year-old and enter his first triathlon, rationalising the deception with cool command: “Forge the certificate, compete illegally, and beat everybody.” We watch as cycling contemporary Bobby Julich recalls how, at the end of his first head-to-head race against Armstrong, when they were both still teenagers, Armstrong yelled at him: “Come on you fucking pussy, let’s keep going – I’m not done yet.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/21/lance-armstrong-documentary-espn-doping-cycling-tour-de-france">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With schools and daycares closed, and employers embracing permanent work-from-home arrangements, women will be forced to pick up the slack<br /></p><p>During this pandemic, a contracting economy, public health fears, and steadily reduced public services have shifted massive amounts of work and caregiving responsibilities to the home – and it is women who are picking up the slack. Even as lockdowns lift and the virus recedes, many of these needs that were previously met outside the home will still be left to families to try to meet within it, and women will be disproportionately affected. The result is a potentially long-term constricting of women’s lives to the domestic sphere. This threatens to undo a century’s worth of progress that women have made in claiming access to public life.</p><p>Some women are home because they’ve lost work. The economic recession that has been prompted by the pandemic has disproportionately hurt woman-dominated service industries, meaning that this time, unlike the 2008 recession, women make up the majority of the newly unemployed. In April, the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/11/economy/women-disadvantaged-economy-coronavirus/index.html">unemployment rate</a> climbed to 15.5% for women, with black women and Latinas facing even higher average unemployment rates.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/21/this-pandemic-threatens-to-undo-what-generations-of-feminists-have-fought-for">Continue reading...</a>

I was intrigued by the addition to the street iconography and developed the idea of making portraits to include both masks and these new lines of separation.</p><p>Most of the people I approached were keen to be photographed, feeling that they wanted to advocate mask wearing. They had widely different reasons for choosing to wear a mask. Some felt they were protecting others – some were fearful of contracting the virus themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/21/mind-the-gap-two-metres-apart-masked-ridley-road-hackney-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We didn’t discover it until my sister checked his Amazon account</p><p><strong>Until lockdown, my seven-year-old son was collected from school by his grandfather as my husband and I work full-time. We class ourselves as responsible parents and have screen time rules and parental controls on our devices. However, my dad bought a Kindle Fire from Amazon in September and unbeknown to us, my son was using it during February and March to make purchases for games he would normally play safely at home.

## John Malkovich: 'I had a lot of violence growing up, but so what?'

<p>The actor lost four close family members in five years, and his life savings to Bernie Madoff – so why does he still think he is the luckiest man around?</p><p>You could spend a lifetime preparing to interview John Malkovich. For starters, there are his films, about 90 of them – mainstream, indie, European arthouse, schlocky, literary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/29/being-john-malkovich-charlie-kaufman-review">self-referential</a>, lots of stinkers and a few classics. But he says he doesn’t even like movies. So then there are his more esoteric projects: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago">a </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago">photography exhibition by Sandro Miller in which Malkovich recreated</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago"> iconic portraits</a>, including Dorothea Lange’s Migrant Mother; collaborations with classical musicians in which he reads out venomous critiques of the great composers. Finally, there is his real love – theatre. Fortunately, Malkovich doesn’t expect you to have seen all his work. In fact, he gives the impression that he would be happy if you had seen none.</p><p>I first interviewed him 27 years ago when he had just made <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">In </a><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0">the Line of Fire</a> – a thriller in which he plays an assassin determined to kill the president (and which is one of his classics). He didn’t mention the film once in our hour-long meeting. Today, he is supposed to be promoting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2018/mar/06/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month">Space Force</a>, a Netflix comedy. Again, he doesn’t mention it, until I ask at the end of our call. Instead, he talks about loss. All sorts of loss, from weight (shedding 32kg – 5st – as a teenager) to hair to money – and even three siblings in their 50s. But, oddly, the more he talks about loss, in that hushed, melancholy voice, the more I begin to suspect he is one of life’s unlikely optimists.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/21/john-malkovich-i-had-a-lot-of-violence-growing-up-but-so-what">Continue reading...</a>

## The Zoom boom: how video-calling became a blessing – and a curse

<p>Video calls have become part of daily life since the pandemic hit, helping the locked-down, especially elderly and disabled people, keep in touch. But there are downsides</p><p>Just before lockdown, 29-year-old Ala Uddin became ill with coronavirus-related symptoms and had to self-isolate in his London flat. “For 23 days I was relying on video calls,” he says. “I hardly used them before, but now it was the only way I could see anyone and communicate with my housemate, even though we were living in rooms next to each other.” Uddin was also regularly video-calling his parents and siblings in York, as well as family members in Bangladesh, all of whom were checking in to make sure he was coping. “Without video calls I don’t know how I could have got through that time,” he says.</p><p>Since the pandemic hit, Zoom, FaceTime, Houseparty, Microsoft Teams and all manner of other video-calling apps have become so engrained in our lives. As one of the only safe ways to communicate, it’s hard to imagine living without them. None of these have taken off quite like Zoom. At the end of December, the app reported a maximum of 10 million daily users. By March, <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/a-message-to-our-users/" title="">200 million</a> people were on it each day to work, socialise, view lessons and lectures, sing in choirs, attend church, birthday parties and weddings, meet new babies, say final words to dying family members and observe Ramadan and Easter. So embedded are these apps in all parts of life now that when Zoom went down last weekend, it made headlines around the world and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/17/widespread-technical-issues-with-zoom-hits-uk-covid-19-briefing" title="">halted the Downing Street press conference</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/21/the-zoom-boom-how-video-calling-became-a-blessing-and-a-curse">Continue reading...</a>
