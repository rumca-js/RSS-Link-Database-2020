Gimli’s father and uncle highlight our latest video in the series on Thorin’s Company.  Today, we look at their lives from their birth in Dunland during the dwarven exile, through Óin’s travels with Balin to Moria and Glóin’s life during and after the Lord of the Rings.  Aside from being closest related to the most famous dwarf in Tolkien’s works, Glóin and Óin were members of the Quest of Erebor.  Glóin was the one King Dain sent to Rivendell to warn Bilbo and to seek Elrond’s counsel.
