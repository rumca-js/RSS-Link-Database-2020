I'm tired of finding videos on YouTube that help creators figure out weird things with Google's platform, so instead of making a video that's 10:01 long and making you sit through 9 minutes of monologuing to inflate my watch time metrics, here's a short minute-long video showing you how to see your YouTube ad revenue metrics in Google AdSense.

And yeah, the thumbnail is ridiculous, but you clicked on it, didn't you?

In this video, I show you how to find the new Raspberry Pis on your network and connect to them with SSH. Then I explain Kubernetes and the many different flavors of Kubernetes you could install on a Raspberry Pi.

Finally, I set up Rancher's K3s lightweight Kubernetes distribution on the Turing Pi cluster, make sure the cluster is working correctly, then show you how to shut down the cluster safely.
