This time around it's just a simple trailer premiere--one for Christopher Nolan's upcoming film, Tenet. \n\nIn the video above, David Ahmadi captures the new trailer, so if you happen to have missed the live premiere--either because you don't have Fortnite or you forgot to log-in or you just couldn't be bothered--then you can watch it here.\n\nThis is not the first time that Fortnite has been the center stage for showcasing a piece of media. An exclusive scene from Star Wars Episode IX: Rise of Skywalker premiered in Fortnite in December 2019 and both DJ Marshmello and Travis Scott have held concerts in Epic Games' battle royale. \n\nIn GameSpot's Fortnite review, Michael Higham wrote: \"While there are several moving parts in the game's ecosystem, Fortnite's biggest accomplishment is in how it seamlessly merges a number of simple mechanics to create a distinguishable battle royale game. What looks to be a straightforward building system steadily escalates to an elaborate display of tactical prowess. As the saying goes: It's easy to learn, hard to master. Although a few shortcomings in the map design eventually surface and fatigue in looting can set in, Fortnite rarely fails at challenging you in unexpected ways, resulting in something more than just another typical last-person-standing shooter.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE2eRwuixfI", "date_published": "2020-05-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Maneater - Review", "description": "Phil Hornshaw chomped, chewed, thrashed, and devoured sea life and uncautious humans for about 12 hours in Maneater on PS4, and wishes Chris Parnell could narrate everyday life, or at least additional shark-related life.

Though the basics of Minecraft still apply, you now need to reinterpret that Minecraft knowledge into how to build the ideal warrior or mage, forge a party of adventurers, and journey into monster-filled labyrinths in search of loot and bosses to defeat. \n\nIn the video above, David Ahmadi fights one such boss. With his trusty bow and dagger in hand, the young rogue journeys into a Tier VI level dungeon, exploring the Redstone Mines until he encounters a blocky boss.\n\nAfter a brief delay, Minecraft Dungeons is scheduled to release for Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch on May 26. The game will be available through Xbox Game Pass on both Xbox One and PC day one, so if you're already a subscriber, you'll be able to go ahead and pick up Minecraft Dungeons \"for free.\" \n\nJust because David goes it alone doesn't mean you have to. Minecraft Dungeons supports both local and online four-player co-op. It's drop-in and drop-out co-op too, so you can call up a friend while in the middle of a dungeon if you're having trouble.\n\n#MinecraftDungeons #GameSpot #Gameplay", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3DyzpBpBZE", "date_published": "2020-05-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "COD: Warzone Bunker Locations And How To Open Them", "description": "The bunkers in Call of Duty: Warzone are opening, and if you have a Red Access Card, you'll be able to get inside most of them.
