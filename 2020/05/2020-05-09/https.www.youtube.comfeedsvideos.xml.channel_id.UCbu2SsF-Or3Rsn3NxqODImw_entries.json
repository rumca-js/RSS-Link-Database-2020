In the video above, Jordan Ram\u00e9e details all of the games currently scheduled to release for Xbox Series X.\n\nFor the most part, the video lists all of the games in alphabetical order. Without release dates for most of the games coming to next-gen systems, it's a little too difficult to list them out in the order you'll be able to play them. \n\nIn total, there are 30 games currently scheduled to release on Xbox Series X. Some are re-releases of games-as-a-service titles, like Rainbow Six Siege and Warframe, while others are brand-new games, such as Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Cyberpunk 2077. It's not all AAA games, either--there are a few indie games already confirmed for Xbox Series X, like Call of the Sea and Chorus.\n\nThe video only covers games confirmed to release or launch on Xbox Series X--games like Starfield and The Elder Scrolls VI are left off. Given how far off games like that are, they'll most likely release on next-generation consoles like Xbox Series X, but we don't know that for sure yet.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NcPKPEJJR0A", "date_published": "2020-05-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Canceled Prince Of Persia Redemption Footage And A Fake Nintendo Direct | Good News Gaming", "description": "This week on Good News Gaming, we take a look at an incredible gesture from the Fallout 76 community, as well as the canceled Prince of Persia game that somehow surfaced on YouTube this week\u2026 after being uploaded eight years ago. We also enjoy a fake Nintendo Direct, and catch up with Greg Miller's fundraising efforts.\n\nOn this episode of Good News Gaming, we take a look at the footage of a canceled Prince of Persia game that's been making the rounds online this week, even though it was uploaded\u2026 eight years ago. We also cover an incredible gesture from the Fallout 76 community, which has rallied to help out one of its most famous role-players in their time of need. \n\nWe also delve into that fake Animal Crossing Direct (and hope that Nintendo is taking notes), as well as watch a very good video essay about horror game soundtracks. There's a couple of excellent memes and funny gaming moments thrown in for good measure. \n\nAs always, if you have any uplifting news stories you'd like to see mentioned next week, leave them in the comments!\n\nIn this video:\n\nGTA Online karma: https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ge1j6h/instant_karma/\nDr CJ Martin's GoFundMe: https://www.gofundme.com/f/doc-cj-martin-of-fallout-76-house-fire\nNick Ha's fake Animal Crossing Nintendo Direct: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auTi3stuL5M \nPolygon article about Animal Crossing weeds: https://www.polygon.com/2020/5/4/21246459/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-weeds-molly-facebook-community-guidelines-strikes-drugs \nRichard Parry's instagram: https://www.instagram.com/_richardparry_/?hl=en \nVerge article about Richard Parry: https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20902806/richard-parry-photography-tech-series-disassembly-some-assembly-required \nWhy Do Horror Games Sound So Beautiful?: https://youtu.be/6aFfN4HtjEc \nPrince of Persia Redemption: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHbRCd8yzaw&feature=emb_title \nKinda Funny's fundraiser: http://kindafunny.com/mizzou \nRed Dead Online oh deer: https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gblcz0/oh_deer_red_dead_redemption_2/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCFPbM49wJo", "date_published": "2020-05-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Dumb Sh*t We Do In Video Games", "description": "Video games may often have an intended way of playing them, but that doesn't mean we always do so. GameSpot's staff looks back on how we've broken the rules in our favorite video games, and simply just played them how we wanted to.\n\nSometimes playing a video game is more than just our experiences following their stories and completing everything we're tasked to do. Whether the game wants us to or not, we always find opportunities to go off the rails and spend countless hours engaging in all manner of ridiculous behavior just for the fun of it. The GameSpot staff has done some pretty dumb stuff in games in our time, and we're willing to bet you have too. \n\nIn the video above, we recount some of our fondest memories, both old and new, spent either trying to break a game's rules or just engaging in a funny activity we made up when we were bored. Our experiences run the spectrum of games, which includesThe Sims, GTA: Vice City, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Street Fighter II.\n\nWhat dumb things do you do in games? Share with us in the comments below! And if you're a fan of hearing our experiences, be sure to let us know that too, as we'd love to make more videos around this subject. After all, the four stories above are only a handful of the many the folks at GameSpot still have to tell!\n\nLink to the full article! https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-dumb-sht-we-do-in-video-games/2900-3474/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_1vPSM2-vY", "date_published": "2020-05-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
