<p>Now onto the second point I didn't get to <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/why-do-i-so-rarely-talk-about-politics-on-my-channel">in my post
yesterday</a>:
politics only matters so much when you're a slave. Or as I put it
there, &quot;You will need politics less than you think.&quot;</p>
<p>That is to say that if you live in a city where your every action is
watched, if you use proprietary software and communicate only via social
media services, if you have no marketable skills because you have some
inert degree and questionably productive and definitely replaceable job
and a large company, you need politics quite a great deal.</p>
<p>Your entire existence in the system is based on being a good boy within
the established boundaries of what is deemed by the mass media to be
socio-politically appropriate. <em>Maybe</em> you've gone into debt, but you
<em>definitely</em> rely the whole &quot;system&quot; for all the basics. If you don't
think you do, just ask yourself whether your life has changed for the
better after the Coronachan Panic of 2020.</p>
<p>What's the alternative? Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRVmfx4EWI0">boomer rants viewers might see some of
this coming</a>...</p>
<p>The fact of the matter is that both the daily ins-and-outs of politics
and the overarching trends of politics matter very little the more
independent your are of the system. Earlier, I always mumbled about how
conservaboomers seemed a little too apathetic about the cultural changes
being forced on them. This social engineering still is the most serious
problem in all technologically-complex mass-media societies, but I must
admit for people who choose personal independence and independence for
their families and local communities, it is much less of a problem.</p>
<p>When I was plugged into the system, minorly red-pilled and generally
peeved because I actually paid attention to the media as something other
than to laugh at, I found the idea of Political &quot;Exit&quot; pretty cucky.
How much sense does it make to leave the &quot;political process&quot;
altogether? Sounds like giving up.</p>
<p>It sounds like giving up because the &quot;political process&quot; is something
internal to the media system at large. That's why even when the
political process does something the media doesn't like (like electing
the Orange Boomer, for example), its actions are immediately rendered
inert by fakery.</p>
<p>The actual solution is creating and participating in organic society,
which still very much exists outside the purview of the media and NGOs
and the like. People still need plumbers. No one is going to fire a
plumber because he says trannies are mentally ill men in
dresses&mdash;otherwise there'd be no plumbers. Or electricians, or
builders or anyone who actually does anything productive. It'd just be
HR, journalists and professors left... and some open source developers
who write more codes of conducts than they do software. Do you think
they'll be able to feed you?</p>
<p>Exiting the system is actually the opposite of surrender. Why would you
think the solution is something like voting or even &quot;owning the libs&quot;
or something publicly advertised as a solution? The actual solution is
building an alternative. Or maybe <em>rebuilding</em> the alternative.</p>
<p>Do you really want to make your boss rich if you think he'd turn around
and betray you because of a media witchhunt? It's better for you to be
doxxed and fired now rather than wait 20 years for it, getting more
ensconced in the insanity. Start becoming more independent now.</p>
<p>A lot of people LARP about what they're going to do when they take over
&quot;the system&quot; by revolution. Revolution, the idea of abrupt enforced
change, however, is fundamentally their idea and if you buy it, you're
going to keep running your head into a wall.</p>
<p>Being independent, living out of the city and the Matrix, however, is
simultaneously like transporting yourself back in time to when things
were saner, but at the same time, transporting yourself into the future
where &quot;the system&quot; has already collapsed and we're already
rebuilding. Be a part of it now rather than later.</p>

## Why do I so rarely talk about politics on my channel?

<p>It's not a huge secret that I'm somewhere in the high echelons of the
red-pill, however you define it. I'll openly talk about pretty any
topic that people organically bring up in streams, or that I'm asked
about, but I've never really made any kind of political content on my
channel, aside from jokes and memes. That might be surprising because
especially three years ago before the mass-bans and algoritm tampering,
right wing political channels were a dime-a-dozen and an easily way to
get views. <strong>There are two main reasons</strong> I never took part. Arguably
&quot;fear of being ZUCCed from YouTube&quot; could be a possible third, but I
have a kind intransigence that makes me relish me being banned. I'm
also pretty tired of YouTube, and am increasingly questioning if using
it is even a reasonable compromise...</p>
<p>So why do I not do political videos? Why do I not have a set list of
deep facts that will blow you away and red-pill you? The two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reason one: 道可道，非常道。名可名，非常名。</li>
<li>Reason two: You will need politics less than you think.</li>
</ul>
<p>Okay, reason one there is just the first line of the Daode Jing. The
Daode Jing is the basic book of Daoism (Taoism), and <em>Dao</em> (literally
&quot;Way&quot;) is an amorphous concept in Chinese thought that could be
crudely comparable to Western concepts of &quot;natural order/law&quot; or maybe
even &quot;spontaneous order.&quot; <strong>&quot;Sounds gay,&quot;</strong> you say. So what does
this famous first line mean and how is it relevant to why I don't talk
about how to get red-pilled? I <em>would</em> say it's hard to translate, but
even saying that would sound even more pretentious as if I actually know
classical Chinese as a native language, but here's a rendering.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The <em>Dao</em> (way) that you can follow isn't the true eternal <em>Dao</em>. A
name that you speak, isn't its true name.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An aside, it should be a capital offense to translate classical Chinese.
It is so perfect and terse and everything autisitically limited to four
elegant syllables that it's just criminal to mutilate it into another
language, but we'll forgive it this time.</p>
<p>So what do I mean by quoting this? I mean that the journey to getting
red-pilled is not something that can be explained. If I could just
explain it, tell it to you, it wouldn't be the true story. It is a
varied, and in each case, personal journey, that one goes on.</p>
<p>Although you've been lied to, it's not the lies that's the problem.
As an adult, you can a lot of the times tell when the media is
manipulating you, especially in the last past decade it's gotten so
obvious even a Boomer could see it. But what you don't see is how when
you were lied to (or told selective truths) as a child, you didn't have
the same BS-detector, and that allowed a lot of deep-seated impressions
about the world to be formed. So a lot of people who don't believe
anything the media says now (rightly) are still mind-cucked. They accept
the programming and differ on the details.</p>
<p>I will give you this hint. Basically all of your programmed emotional
responses are your enemies. There was an old Moldbug blog post where he
talked about even far after &quot;awaking from his dogmatic slumber,&quot; he
still was surprised that if he saw a group of Nazi LARPers, he would
reflexively have a pang of emotional stress, but if he saw Stalinist
LARPers, he wouldn't have the same kind of emotional reaction. I think
everyone raised in the West has that same programmed reaction. You might
know with your head that the communist death count is supposed to be
higher and the suppression wider, but it doesn't click because you
weren't made sensitive to it.</p>
<p>A good heuristic is whenever you see one of these emotional responses,
especially an emotional response to a political term: democracy,
equality, racism, feminism, literally all of them actually, <strong>your
Pavlovian conditioning is telling you to avoid an intellectual area
specifically because it is the ideological weak spot of the background
propaganda of modernism.</strong> If it was not a weak spot, there would be no
harm in you being allowed to calmly investigate it. People's thoughts
are regulated in liberal democracy not by laws, but by psychological
programming that goes off when someone is tempted to evaluate an idea
they're not supposed to. Okay, actually I guess in Europe they're
regulated by that and laws, and it's coming to America very, very soon
now.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that breaking out of this programming is not so
much of an issue of me or anyone else explaining a series of facts to
you. 道可道，非常道。 That's what Laozi said. As cringe as it sounds,
it is primarily a battle against yourself, or at least the part of
yourself that has eaten up the tacit assumptions of modernism. <strong>Before
you own the libs, you must own yourself.</strong> Laozi said that too.</p>
<p>In case quoting classical Chinese and talking in floating, general terms
isn't getting across, I'll say that getting red-pilled is sort of
mystical... literally. Of course, &quot;mystical&quot; in the old, original
Greek sense. A &quot;mystic&quot; in Greek is just a synonym for an
&quot;initiate.&quot; Many cultic religions of two millennia ago where like
modern Freemasonry: not a ideology one could just go and read about on
Wikipedia, but one where people were slowly initiated in the thought and
mindset of the religion over time. While people were born into Paganism,
they were <em>initiated</em> into Gnosticism, Hermeticism or even early
Christianity. The only difference is that you are being initiated <em>out</em>
of the cultural bubble of modernism. Into what? It can vary person to
person, experience to experience. You'll always be in some bubble, so
don't be arrogant, but you will be out of the big bubble that's going
to pop everywhere and is dominated by liberal cat-ladies, professors,
sanctimonious NGO-members and journalists.</p>
<p>All of this is to say that it is simply impossible for me to provide you
direct direction. Even direction might sound stupid before or after.
Maybe I can lay out some random disorganized recommendations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Years ago as young college student, I remember reading <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/steven+pinker+blank+slate">Steven
Pinker's <em>Blank
Slate</em></a>
(<a href="http://gen.lib.rus.ec/search.php?req=blank+slate+steven+pinker">dl</a>)
and thinking I was finally red-pilled. Now I think Steven Pinker is
a moron (that book and only that book of his is good, the rest is
beyond garbage). I've actually met many people for whom this book
was the first step away from basic boomer-tier progressivism. I
suspect that Pinker almost regrets writing this book because he's
actually very basic in politics. He wrote it back before the elite
recognized any threat of a resurgence of energy on the right.</li>
<li>I think everyone knows that <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/files/unabomber.pdf">Uncle Ted's
manifesto</a> is another
favorite on my channel. I never read it until long after I needed
it, but since it's a meme now I should recommend it explicitly.</li>
<li>If you're prepped for harder stuff
<a href="https://radishmag.wordpress.com/archive/">Radishmag</a> has it. This
one <em>tries</em> to evoke that programmed emotional response in a
devilish way, but it might be exactly the next step with plenty of
actual original sources on historical articles to follow up with.</li>
<li>Everything <a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/nassim%20taleb">Nassim Taleb</a>
has written is good. He might be the only living author worth
reading now in fact, which isn't saying <em>that</em> much considering our
age, but Taleb is pretty based and has attracted a constellation of
non-retarded people who employ the very useful concepts he's
popularized: antifragile, Lindy, buttercuck... (okay maybe the last
one he didn't coin himself, but I'm buttercucked and proud). Read
his books before you even look up videos of him or shadow him on
social media. His books are lucid, but you won't get it based on
mere social media. He also has no patience for brainlets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, you can be red-pilled too quickly and end up like that guy in the
Matrix who looks like me and betrays his friends so he can be put back
in the matrix to have nice juicy steaks again. Did he make an appearance
in Runescape as well?</p>
<p>Anyway, I wrote more of this than I thought I was going to, and <strong>I
never got to reason two!</strong> I'll write it tomorrow after church. You can
read it once you get back from church providing it isn't banned where
you live.</p>
<p>Speaking of church, for those interested in early Christian theology, or
frankly Greek philosophy generally, notice how similar 名 <em>name/word</em>
&quot;míng&quot; in the Chinese above is equivalent to <em>logos</em>. In fact, 名 is
even used both in the particular sense &quot;the name that you speak&quot; as I
render it, and in the universal abstract sense of <em>logos</em>. This pun,
which doesn't exist in English without some explanation, does exist in
both classical Chinese and Greek. More on that later.</p>
