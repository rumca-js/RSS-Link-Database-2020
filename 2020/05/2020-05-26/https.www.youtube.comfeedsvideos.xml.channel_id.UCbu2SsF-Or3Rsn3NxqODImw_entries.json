It tells the story of Ellie and Joel, two people caught up in a world where the Cordyceps Brain Infection has turned the majority of the human race into angry ravenous creatures. Usually the virus takes over the brain in a matter of days, but Ellie was bitten weeks prior and hasn\u2019t turned. Ellie might be the key to finding a cure to the fungal infection, so the two travel across the country to meet up with the Fireflies, a militia group looking to restore the US government and find a vaccine. \n\nThis video will recap the story of The Last of Us, as well as its story DLC, Left Behind, to prepare you for The Last of Us Part 2. We still recommend playing or replaying The Last of Us and Left Behind if and when you get the chance.\n\nThe Last of Us Part II was originally announced at PSX in 2016 and is set to be released on June 19, 2020 and takes place five years after the events of The Last of Us.
