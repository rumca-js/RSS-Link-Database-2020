All you need is a url of a video and a list of timecodes, I made a script that takes both and automatically splits and properly tags all the track in an album on YouTube (or chapters in an audiobook). I wrote this a while ago and have used it a lot and it's saved me a lot of effort. Check out the script below and see if it inspires you to optimize something you're trying to get done.

Some of the big advantages of dwmblocks is the ability to signal changes in modules, rather than rerunning scripts over and over again. My build is also clickable, left and middle clicks run commands, right click opens an informational message and shift clicks open the actual script to edit. All of the modules are scripts that can be easily customized and I've had them since my i3blocks build with many improvements.

Remember it requires a properly patched version of dwm, like mine:
