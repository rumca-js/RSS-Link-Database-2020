Mortal Kombat 11's next expansion, Aftermath, is out now. It features a new cinematic story, three new fighters--Sheeva, Fujin, and RoboCop--and three more skin packs launching over time. Also featured in the new expansion are more "Friendships," which are the non-violent finishing moves that are nothing like the franchise's better known Fatalities and Brutalities. 

In this GameSpot video, we take a look at every character's Friendship--and they're pretty great. We won't spoil the surprise for you, so be sure to check out the full video to see what they are. 

Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath is out now for PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The expansion costs $40 USD.

The Last of Us was released in 2013 to rave reviews from critics and players. It tells the story of Ellie and Joel, two people caught up in a world where the Cordyceps Brain Infection has turned the majority of the human race into angry ravenous creatures. Usually the virus takes over the brain in a matter of days, but Ellie was bitten weeks prior and hasn’t turned. Ellie might be the key to finding a cure to the fungal infection, so the two travel across the country to meet up with the Fireflies, a militia group looking to restore the US government and find a vaccine. 

This video will recap the story of The Last of Us, as well as its story DLC, Left Behind, to prepare you for The Last of Us Part 2. We still recommend playing or replaying The Last of Us and Left Behind if and when you get the chance.

The Last of Us Part II was originally announced at PSX in 2016 and is set to be released on June 19, 2020 and takes place five years after the events of The Last of Us. You can check out our original review for The Last of Us and stay tuned for more coverage on The Last of Us Part II on GameSpot.
