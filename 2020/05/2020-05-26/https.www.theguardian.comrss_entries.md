## Bayern close on title after Kimmich chip floors Dortmund in Der Klassiker

<p>Joshua Kimmich’s sublime chip gave Bayern Munich a 1-0 win at second-placed Borussia Dortmund in <em>Der Klassiker</em> as the Bundesliga leaders put one hand on the title. Kimmich’s perfectly weighted effort left Roman Bürki stranded in the 43rd minute as the champions landed a big win at an empty stadium that normally seats 80,000 fans.</p><p>“We now have a good cushion on Dortmund,” Kimmich said. “That was brutally important today. “It’ll be mentally difficult for Dortmund to keep up. We have to reaffirm this lead in the next games. You could see that it was very, very intense and we had to work our way up to the three points. It was relatively balanced, especially in the first half we made many simple mistakes. Dortmund were very bold.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/26/borussia-dortmund-bayern-munich-bundesliga-der-klassiker-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>David Olusoga’s answer to Who Do You Think You Are? returns, charting the inhabitants of a Bristol dwelling funded by slave-trading and telling stories which need to be heard</p><p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09l64y9">A House Through Time</a> (BBC2) has always been an oasis of calm. Partly because of presenter David Olusoga’s permanent air of absolute tranquillity (some people may find it bordering on soporific – I feel more as though he’s enabling me to let the edges of the scene blur and melt) and partly because its subject – unlike the messy humanity of Who Do You Think You Are? – is essentially neutral. The house whose history is under discussion is blessedly silent. It is the place to which we all return after the story of each of its owners or tenants is told, to gather our thoughts, digest what we have learned and mull the wider implications before setting out again down a new avenue.</p><p>For series three, the focus is on an older house than usual. Number 10 Guinea Street in Redcliffe, Bristol – Olusoga’s home town since the 1990s – is a gracious three-storey (plus attic, plus basement), ornately plastered, beautifully panelled and flagstoned pile built, along with several others, by a Captain Edmund Saunders in 1718. And, like most gracious three-storey piles built by sea captains in Bristol in the 18th century, it was funded by fortunes made from slave trading.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/26/a-house-through-time-review-an-absorbing-important-history-lesson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The makers and subjects of On the Record talk about bringing alleged sexual abuse by Russell Simmons to light and why Oprah Winfrey disowned the film</p><p>In mid-December 2017, two months after reporting on Harvey Weinstein triggered what is now known as the #MeToo movement, Drew Dixon bought a copy of the New York Times at a coffee shop in Brooklyn, where she moved 25 years prior as a starry-eyed college grad determined to work in music.

Cummings, the chief strategist in the government that devised this rule, surely knew that safeguarding women and children from abuse and neglect was the intention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/exceptional-circumstances-clause-domestic-abuse-victims-dominic-cummings-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

## My boyfriend has sex in silence – is that normal?

<p>I want him to feel he can enjoy lovemaking – how can I encourage him to just relax and be himself?</p><p><strong>I have been with my boyfriend for about 10 months,</strong><strong> and have</strong><strong> never been </strong><strong>happier. The only thing is,</strong><strong> I feel slightly uncomfortable in the bedroom with him, compared with </strong><strong>how I’ve felt in previous relationships. </strong><strong>The main issue is that he’s never been vocal during sex. I’ve tried asking him what he likes, and he’s always shrugged it off. It’s making me feel as if I’m not good enough for him. </strong><strong>I can’t do anything to please him without knowing what he </strong><strong>is into. He has opened up about not being confident about sex in his previous relationship, and that he has been rejected many </strong><strong> times, so I</strong><strong> think this has something to do with it, but is it a thing that men don’t moan or even speak during sex and foreplay? When we have discussions about sex, I always say to him that I want him to feel more relaxed and confident around me. I know it’s easier said than done, but I really want to help him feel </strong><strong>he can be himself and </strong><strong>enjoy sex. My boyfriend always ejaculates, so I must be doing something right.</strong></p><p>Your boyfriend has already shared his lack of confidence and fear of rejection – and you can assume it will take him some time to become less anxious during sex. He is erotically responsive to you, but he has to bypass his anxiety in order to achieve climax – and that’s not easy for him. And perhaps you, too, lack confidence in your ability to please him and are searching for signs that he is satisfied. Breathe. Don’t push him. Saying: “Try to relax,” will only make him less comfortable. Your best course of action is to praise and encourage him for even small things he does that please you, and express your own pleasure vocally. This will subtly build his sense of sexual efficacy, and eventually he will enjoy it more consistently. However, although some men do express their excitement vocally, most have been taught to be secretive about sex and have learned to suppress expressions of pleasure and be silent. Don’t take this personally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/26/my-boyfriend-has-sex-in-silence-is-that-normal">Continue reading...</a>

## 'I'd love to see their parents' bank accounts': corona and comedy's class divide

<p>From care work to shelf-stacking, many standups have taken up jobs to survive lockdown – highlighting how privilege has created a two-tier system in comedy</p><p>On 16 March, when Boris Johnson advised people to avoid pubs and theatres, the effect on live comedy was instant. “That night was like Take Me Out when all the lights go off, but with my diary,” says standup Lauren Pattison. “The first month of work went in the space of a couple of days.”</p><p>In 2017, Pattison finally became a full-time comedian after years of working in restaurants, shops and bars to support her standup career. Soon after, she was nominated for best newcomer at the Edinburgh Comedy awards. Now, she’s working in a supermarket. Pattison had moved back to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/04/howay-the-laughs-is-there-a-geordie-sense-of-humour">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> a few weeks before lockdown to save money for the Edinburgh fringe while living with her parents. Like many standups, she relies on live comedy for the bulk of her income, gigging most nights of the week. Some gigs are rescheduled for later this year, but, says Pattison, “I’ve got to mentally and financially prepare for the fact they might get pulled.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/26/standup-comedy-class-divide-coronavirus-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The man who guided Marseille to the Champions League is seldom remembered outside France and Belgium but his tactical wizardry and brushes with crime make him a fascinating figure<br /></p><p>The first final after the rebranding of Europe’s premiere club competition as the Champions League took place 27 years ago this Tuesday. It was a stinker. Marseille, who beat Milan 1-0 in Munich, had contested an even grimmer final two years previously, losing the European Cup on penalties to Red Star Belgrade. Two lustreless showpieces are part of the reason why Marseille’s then manager, Raymond Goethals, is seldom recalled as a great outside France and his native Belgium despite an extraordinary career spanning nearly four decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/26/raymond-goethals-marseilles-messiah-who-toppled-mighty-milan">Continue reading...</a>

Instead, Aarons concentrated on the holiday where the weather is perfect, cocktails at 11am are the norm, and sunglasses are always massive.

<p>Pioneers, PoWs and those taking spiritual paths immerse the reader in beautiful and treacherous landscapes and offer wisdom for our times </p><p>For the past 10 years, I have chased up and down mountains in wind, rain, snow and sun. Walking, rock-climbing, swimming and camping: a trip into the hills is always intense, visceral and life-affirming. I love meeting the elements and discovering what the mountain has to offer on any given day. Nan Shepherd’s seminal book on the Cairngorms, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/sep/20/living-mountain-nan-shepherd-review">The Living Mountain</a><em>, </em>opened my eyes to the many ways of perceiving a mountain.</p><p>In picking these books, I’ve steered away from the macho-mountain trend (not all hill-goers are male daredevils pitting themselves against nature). These stories of joy, wonder, fear and wisdom go some way towards filling the current void. Their voices lead me back into the remote high lands.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/26/10-of-the-best-books-about-mountains-for-a-virtual-climb">Continue reading...</a>

## New Zealanders – like Jacinda Ardern – might not be shocked by earthquakes, but we do get scared | Charlotte Graham-McClay

<p>Many of us recognised ourselves in the PM’s cool response to an earthquake on live TV, but we do fear the ‘big one’</p><p>As I awoke to the bedroom shuddering and rattling around me on Monday morning, my first thought was a frantic household census, followed by the realisation that I was alone at home and not responsible for anyone’s safety but my own. My second, before my eyes had even properly unstuck themselves from sleep, was: “Ugh, not this again.”</p><p>Moments later, the earthquake – a magnitude 5.9 shake that hit about an hour’s drive north of Wellington, New Zealand, where I live – was subsiding. It rattled the lower part of the North Island for just 15 seconds or so, long enough for a little tendril of fear to uncurl – would it build, or die away? Was this “the big one”?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/26/new-zealanders-like-jacinda-ardern-might-not-be-shocked-by-earthquakes-but-we-do-get-scared">Continue reading...</a>

## 'I will kill you if you give this song to anyone but me': how Peggy Lee was perfect for Is That All There Is?

<p>As coronavirus derails plans for a concert to celebrate the centenary of Lee’s birth, <strong>Kevin EG Perry</strong> looks back on a singer whose seductive style masked rejection and pain</p><p>In September 1968, songwriting titans <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/aug/23/jerry-leiber-obituary">Jerry Leiber</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/sep/03/how-we-made-stand-by-me">Mike Stoller</a> were on the hunt for a singer for their curious new composition Is That All There Is? The song was something of a departure for the writers of Hound Dog and Jailhouse Rock. It had been inspired by Thomas Mann’s 1896 short story <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24072516-disillusionment">Disillusionment</a>, which deals with what Leiber called “the existential hole that sits in the centre of our souls”. The fatalistic spoken-word verses describe the narrator watching their house burn down, losing their first love, and even facing death, “that final disappointment”, with sanguine grace.</p><p>The pair felt the song needed an actress to sell it so offered it to Marlene Dietrich and Barbra Streisand before thinking of Peggy Lee. After catching her show at the Copacabana in New York, they handed Lee a demo. She called them the moment she listened to it. “I will kill you if you give this song to anyone but me,” she said. “This is my song. This is the story of my life.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/26/peggy-lee-perfect-is-that-all-there-is-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When he was six, Paul Alexander contracted polio and was paralysed for life. Today he is 74, and one of the last people in the world still using an iron lung. But after surviving one deadly outbreak, he did not expect to find himself threatened by another. By Linda Rodriguez McRobbie </p><p>The summer of 1952 was hot, even by Texas standards: 25 days above 100F (38C), the “cool” days not much cooler. But across the state, swimming pools were shut. Cinemas, too, and bars and bowling alleys. Church services were suspended. Cities doused their streets with DDT insecticide; by now, health officials knew that mosquitoes didn’t spread the disease, but they had to be seen to be doing something. Nothing seemed to work. As the summer wore on, the numbers of polio cases grew.</p><p>One day in July, in a quiet Dallas suburb, a six-year-old boy named Paul Alexander was playing outside in the summer rain. He didn’t feel well – his neck hurt, his head pounded. Leaving his muddy shoes in the yard, he walked barefoot into the kitchen, letting the screen door slam behind him. When his mother looked up at his feverish face, she gasped. She made him run out and grab his shoes, then ordered him to bed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/26/last-iron-lung-paul-alexander-polio-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

Clap for our carers: the sound of applause rising in the air. Leila was doing her rounds of the Waitrose in west London where she works as a store supervisor, rounding up the stragglers. An expensively dressed young woman was browsing the aisles. Leila asked her to make her way to the tills, as the store was now closed.</p><p>The woman erupted in rage. “She said: ‘There’s a fucking pandemic, can’t you have a little patience?’” Leila remembers. “I thought: ‘I am working through this pandemic. You’re just shopping in it.’” Shaking with anger, Leila fetched a security guard, who escorted the woman to the tills. Leaving work that evening, the irony of being verbally abused during the weekly celebration of key workers was not lost on her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/26/people-were-like-animals-how-supermarket-staff-watched-coronavirus-crisis-unfold">Continue reading...</a>

## The new immigration rules are not really about Brexit. They're about ripping off workers | Daniel Trilling

Over the past few months the Home Office has fought hard to maintain the labyrinthine bureaucracy, exorbitant fees and harsh punishments that govern the lives of migrants from outside the European Union. Rules that ban some people from accessing NHS treatment, food banks and emergency housing have <a href="https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2020/may/the-hostile-environment-continued">only been partially eased</a>; while detention centres have not been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52560093">fully evacuated</a>, and the Home Office has been accused of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/06/home-office-accused-of-pressuring-judiciary-over-immigration-decisions">putting pressure on immigration judges</a> releasing detainees on bail. Concessions for NHS and care workers, meanwhile – on visa extensions for bereaved families, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/21/a-timeline-of-the-pms-u-turn-on-the-nhs-surcharge-a-timeline-of-pms-u-turn-nhs-surcharge-for-migrant-health-workers">lifting the immigration health surcharge</a> – have only been made haltingly, after pressure from the public, the Labour party and even some Conservative MPs.</p><p>The government has pushed ahead with its plans to extend much of this migration system to include EU citizens. The home secretary, Priti Patel, who has previously been criticised for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/priti-patel-home-office-asylum-seekers-detention-coronavirus-a9480036.html">avoiding scrutiny</a> during the crisis, began a publicity drive for the second reading of the new immigration bill. “This historic piece of legislation,” <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1283319/priti-patel-news-immigration-EU-free-movement-brexit">Patel wrote</a> in the Express, “ends the European Union’s free movement of people and lays the foundations to build a fairer, firmer, skills-led points-based immigration system.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/26/immigration-rules-brexit-ripping-off-workers-covid-19-low-skilled">Continue reading...</a>
