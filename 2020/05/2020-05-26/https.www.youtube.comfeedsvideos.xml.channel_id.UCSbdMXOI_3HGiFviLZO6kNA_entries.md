Hello and WELCOME TO: TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR News. 

I'm not kidding here when I say this. This is probably one of the biggest news pieces of have covered here on my channel for VR and AR (XR) related things. Qualcomm had a press announcement this morning and the embargos have finally dropped. We are in for an entirely new wave of VR like we have ever seen. This.. is very well what  we could have called VR 2.0 way back, but it's nothing like what I had expected. Over 15 companies have decided to work together for VR to go mainstream along with 5g adaptations. Lets see where this goes! new headsets, 5g, wireless, cheap.. exciting.
