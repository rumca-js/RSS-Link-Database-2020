A short free mini-documentary on SpaceX ahead of their planned Demo 2 astronaut launch.

You are Elon Musk, the 2001 Elon Musk. You hit it big with PayPal during the Dot Com Boom in Silicon Valley and now are left with all this money lying around. Most people in this situation would probably sit back and enjoy the fruits of their labor. But you’re different, you view money as not the endgame, but a tool.

You decided to move to LA. When you visited NASA’s website, there was literally nothing! But you are a smart guy, you come to the conclusion that everything comes down to public support. You gather up a bunch of experts and task them with coming up with some kind of grand spectacle that would reinvigorate people’s spirit to get to Mars again.  

Even though all your friends and family tried to talk you out of your space ambitions so you wouldn’t waste all your money, you and a few friends hop on a flight to Moscow. The Russians were the only ones that could possibly fit your budget. 

You turn around and say “hey guys, I think we can build this rocket ourselves.” But not everyone can afford these expensive launches. If the Russians won’t do it, if the US won’t do it, then it’s up to you to turn interplanetary travel into a reality - and SpaceX was born. After studying rocket science and the space industry for months, Space Exploration Technologies was formed in an old warehouse in LA

You bring your startup know-how of being lean, moving fast, pivoting fast with limited funds, and apply it to the space industry that’s full of these slow-moving bureaucratic behemoths like Lockheed and Boeing.

SpaceX got its first customer, the Department of Defense for a satellite launch. It took an entire year before SpaceX would launch. Employees were trying not to throw up, the fate of your dream of interplanetary travel was on the line.

You finally proved yourself to the world. Both Tesla and SpaceX were so out of money that you had to borrow from friends to make payroll.

Today, things have gone as great. You’ve single-handedly inspired a new generation of people excited to explore the final frontier. You’ve come full circle back to your childhood days of fantasizing about space travel, except now, it’s a one step closer to becoming a reality. Keep an open mind to what’s possible
