The showcase will include new reveals and lots of gameplay, and we even had developers create short little developer diaries so you could meet the passionate people behind the games you'll be playing.\n\nFollowing the Indie Showcase, from June 12 - 14 we will be providing post-show coverage on YouTube and Twitch featuring many of the games you saw in the showcase via in-depth hands-on demos, pre-recorded gameplay videos, and interviews with the developers.\n\nWe're very excited to put on this event to bookend another year of The Escapist's rejuvenation effort as we work to provide a positive and fun atmosphere for our viewers to escape to, all while supporting the independent developers that have lost out on many opportunities to showcase their games due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nJoin our YouTube Membership program for Early Access to videos, badges, emojis, bonus content and more. \u25ba\u25ba https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqg5FCR7NrpvlBWMXdt-5Vg/join\n\nSubscribe to Escapist Magazine! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/Sub2Escapist\n\nWant to see the next episode a week early?
