I wrote this a while ago and have used it a lot and it's saved me a lot of effort.

My build is also clickable, left and middle clicks run commands, right click opens an informational message and shift clicks open the actual script to edit. All of the modules are scripts that can be easily customized and I've had them since my i3blocks build with many improvements.\n\nGet dwmblocks:\nhttps://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwmblocks\nRemember it requires a properly patched version of dwm, like mine:\nhttps://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwm\n\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\r\nDONATE NOW: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UP2QpHmcgyk", "date_published": "2020-05-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
