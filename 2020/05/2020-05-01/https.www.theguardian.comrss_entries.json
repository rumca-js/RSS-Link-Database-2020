Setting aside the commotion over its smartly executed illusion of being shot in two long takes, Mendes\u2019s film is a man-on-a-mission tale in a simple, even classical vein, thinly characterised in ways that somewhat curtail its emotional impact.

First as a sense of unease as I regain consciousness and then physical and mental distress as I reconnect with the reality of the new normal. It can still take me a couple of hours of hiding under the duvet before I feel brave enough to get up and have breakfast. Some things have changed, though. Thankfully my dreams are no longer quite so terrifying. Rather, they have switched into something more distant and desolate where I am disconnected from the present. One night I dreamed first I was with my son, who was learning to fly in the Lofoten Islands \u2013 somewhere I\u2019ve never been (nor have I watched the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/04/tv-tonight-nordic-mistaken-identity-thriller-twin-begins\">TV series </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/04/tv-tonight-nordic-mistaken-identity-thriller-twin-begins\">Twin</a>) and would not be unable to place on a map of Norway \u2013 and then that I was in a spaceship with Buzz Aldrin as we were flying to the edge of the solar system. Buzz didn\u2019t seem that pleased to have me for company. What\u2019s also changed is that during the day some of the anxiety now dissipates into sadness and depression. Sadness both at the scale of the crisis \u2013 we are now well past the chief scientific adviser\u2019s \u201cbest result\u201d death toll of 20,000, with no end in sight \u2013 and at my own personal losses. In particular the separation from my family, friends and colleagues. In the early days of the lockdown I was somehow able to kid myself that maybe the quarantine wouldn\u2019t last that long. But now it\u2019s sunk in that the government is making things up as it goes along, life may not return to normal for many months and that all plans will have to be put on hold. I remember my mother telling me how she and some friends danced down Piccadilly during an air raid in the second world war (I\u2019m assuming they were a bit pissed) before a warden angrily shepherded them into a shelter. I can\u2019t quite work out whether I need a bit more or a bit less of that sort of spirit.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/01/should-i-be-like-my-mother-who-danced-in-the-streets-during-the-blitz\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/01/should-i-be-like-my-mother-who-danced-in-the-streets-during-the-blitz", "date_published": "2020-05-01 09:36:13+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Has Sweden's coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? | Gina Gustavsson", "description": "<p>Talk of Swedish exceptionalism and wounded national pride has echoes of the forces unleashed in Britain by Brexit</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March.
