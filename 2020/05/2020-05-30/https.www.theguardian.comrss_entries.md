<p>(Dischord) <br />Former members of Minor Threat, Fugazi and the Evens deliver a bracing blast of moral, melodic US punk</p><p>It’s difficult to overstate the significance of <a href="https://www.dischord.com/band/fugazi" title="">Fugazi</a>. An American art-rock institution, they provided a slinky, authoritative moral racket from the late 80s until the early 00s. Ever since this totemic post-hardcore band went on indefinite hiatus back in 2003, there have been calls for them to reform. They show no signs of doing that.</p><p>Analogues exist. Contemporary punk outfits such as Bristol punk heroes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/idles" title="">Idles</a> are, consciously or not, made in Fugazi’s image: aggressive in sound, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkF_G-RF66M" title="">communitarian in ethos</a>, and constantly querying the testosterone lunacy that comes with the punk tag. Now, there is <a href="https://coriky.bandcamp.com/" title="">Coriky</a>, a band made up of Fugazi’s singing guitarist Ian MacKaye and bassist Joe Lally, with the addition of singing drummer Amy Farina. (Before Coriky, MacKaye and Farina, who are married, released three albums as <a href="https://www.dischord.com/band/evens" title="">the Evens</a>.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/30/coriky-album-review-ian-mackaye-joe-lally-fugazi-amy-farina">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Poppy, witty and experimental, the Isle of Wight indie rock quartet are far more interesting than a cursory listen suggests</p><p>Countless islands make up the United Kingdom, and the Isle of Wight might be the most misunderstood of them all. It’s never just been home to teenagers waiting to leave and pensioners waiting to die, but it’s still surprising to find promising indie rockers such as <a href="https://www.coach-party.com/">Coach Party</a> staying put and insisting the music industry come to them.</p><p>Jess (vocals/bass), Steph, Joe (guitars) and Guy (drums) only played their first gig a few months ago, yet the strength of their songs persuaded London label Chess Club, which released early work by Wolf Alice, Jungle and Mumford &amp; Sons, to travel south and issue their first singles. They are now collected on an EP, <em>Party Food</em>, along with three new tracks, and although there are moments reminiscent of bigger bands, there’s a punchy wit to Coach Party’s relationship-driven lyrics. The arrangements are poppy yet experimental, and served with a confidence that only comes from not hiding behind other people’s ideas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/30/one-to-watch-coach-party-isle-of-wight-party-food">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Burnley’s goalkeeper on his lower-league journey, learning not to fear mistakes and his desire to dislodge Jordan Pickford</p><p>The goalkeeper’s lot is the peculiarity that hides in plain sight. They train alone most of the time, their technical and fitness work being entirely bespoke, and, come match day, it is preferable that they see as little of the ball as possible. Their view of the pitch is different, fixed and detached – everything feels different – and, for them, the game is as much psychological as physical, the ultimate test of focus.</p><p>Nick Pope uses words such as “singular” and “individual”. The Burnley and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/england">England</a>&nbsp;goalkeeper remembers how as a young player, he had no&nbsp;teammate&nbsp;to talk him through matches, to offer positional tips.

<p>Any player not included in the 55-man group named by selectors has little hope of an international future</p><p>There must be some grumpy English professional cricketers out there this weekend. Let me try to bowdlerise their thoughts: “Our wise selectors have plucked out 55 players for training ahead of the proposed international matches this summer and I do not appear to be among them. Fifty-five represents no fewer than five cricket teams so this is a source of some disappointment since I thought that I might still have the chance of the ultimate honour, playing for my country, in the foreseeable future. This now seems a rather distant dream. So it’s back to the nets, whenever that is allowed for the journeymen dirt-trackers. Que sera, sera.” The unbowdlerised version probably would not take so long and it might sully your morning.</p><p>Most of the names on the longest list ever produced by the England selectors are predictable and by and large they come from the obvious sources. No one employed by Derbyshire, Glamorgan, Leicestershire and (promoted) Northamptonshire has been selected; Surrey provide the most players with nine (they signed Reece Topley in the winter); there are seven from Lancashire and six from Yorkshire and Somerset. One oddity is that Essex, the county champions in two of the past three years, have just one player selected, Dan Lawrence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/30/englands-long-list-leaves-those-who-failed-to-make-the-cut-beyond-consolation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From raspberries to gooseberries, blackcurrants or tayberries, we can enjoy soft fruit all summer long</p><p>Soft raspberries and wineberries; sun-warmed strawberries so ripe you can smell them before you see them; blueberries, gooseberries, blackcurrants, and the strange delicacy that is white currants. Then there are jostaberries, worcesterberries, tayberries and the fattest blackberries you can imagine. Our climate may not be one for citrus or mangoes, but we have berries and we can have them all summer long.</p><p>Productive soft fruit is the most cost-effective of all food growing when you compare with shop prices – productive being the operative word here. It is very easy to do little and have plants that do the same. Strawberries need love poured into them in the form of liquid feed high in potash (comfrey is ideal) once a week during the growing season; regularly propagate runners to maintain vigour and mulch with well-rotted compost from autumn to early spring to keep the soil in good health. That, a lot of sun and, crucially, a sheltered spot, as bees don’t like to be belted about to find their tea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/30/how-to-grow-berries">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Things fall apart': the apocalyptic appeal of WB Yeats's The Second Coming

<p>Written 100 years ago, Yeats’s poem has been absorbed into the cultural bloodstream from Chinua Achebe to The Sopranos, Joan Didion to Gordon Gecko. Why is it such a touchstone in times of chaos?<br /></p><p>In April 1936, three years before his death, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/irish-poet-wb-yeats-150th-birthday-celebrations">WB Yeats</a> received a letter from the writer and activist Ethel Mannin. The 70-year-old Yeats was a Nobel prize-winning poet of immense stature and influence, not to mention Mannin’s former lover, and she asked him to join a campaign to free a German pacifist incarcerated by the Nazis. Yeats responded instead with a reading recommendation: “If you have my poems by you, look up a poem called ‘The Second Coming’,” he wrote. “It was written some sixteen or seventeen years ago &amp; foretold what is happening. I have written of the same thing again &amp; again since. This will seem little to you with your strong practical sense for it takes fifty years for a poet’s weapons to influence the issue.”</p><p>Yeats was justified in taking the long view. Written in 1919 and published in 1920, “The Second Coming” has become perhaps the most plundered poem in the English language. At 164 words, it is short and memorable enough to be famous <em>in toto</em> but it has also been disassembled into its constituent parts by books, albums, movies, TV shows, comic books, computer games, political speeches and newspaper editorials. While many poems in Yeats’s corpus have contributed indelible lines to the storehouse of the cultural imagination (“no country for old men”; “the foul rag and bone shop of the heart”), “The Second Coming” consists of almost nothing <em>but</em> such lines. Someone reading it for the first time in 2020 might resemble the apocryphal theatregoer who complained that <em>Hamlet</em> was nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together. Whether or not it is Yeats’s greatest poem, it is by far his most useful. As Auden wrote in “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2007/apr/18/poemoftheday10">In Memory of WB Yeats</a>” (1939), “The words of a dead man / Are modified in the guts of the living.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/30/things-fall-apart-the-apocalyptic-appeal-of-wb-yeats-the-second-coming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the Bridesmaids star, playing Gloria Steinem in her 1970s battle for women’s rights has been a reminder that the same arguments are raging today<br /></p><p>A few days before New York locked down and Broadway closed indefinitely, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/rose-byrne" title="">Rose Byrne</a> was on stage in Brooklyn, doing Medea. It was a sold-out run, co-starring her husband, Bobby Cannavale, in an updated version of the Euripides classic. Already, in that first week of March, people were starting to not show up, and those who did were in an odd mood. “There was something subdued about the audience,” says Byrne. “I mean, it’s Medea – and not <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/12/tyler-perry-madea-creator-of-a-racial-stereotype-or-the-greatest-indie-film-maker-ever" title="">Tyler Perry</a>’s version – so it’s not full of laughs.” Still, she says, “the last week was strange. You could feel a tension.” The show closed on 8 March, one of the few in the city to finish its run. Four days later, the theatres went dark.</p><p>Since then, the 40-year-old actor, along with Cannavale and their two kids, both under five, have been in their home in Brooklyn. Byrne peers into the camera from a dimly lit room in her house, hair tied up in a wrap that conceals what she says is the crash in personal grooming. There is, in these times, nothing so endearing to other New Yorkers as the New Yorker of means who, at the first sign of the pandemic, didn’t clear off to their house in the country. “We’ve taken some weekend trips here and there,” says Byrne, “but otherwise we’re holding tight and waiting to see… ” She trails off.

Is this a fever dream? </p><p>I was wondering when the robots would take over, and it is apparently now. The Fantastical Factory of Curious Craft (Sunday, 8.15pm, Channel 4) has clearly been generated by an AI-powered machine glowing ominously deep inside Channel 4 HQ, because I refuse to believe a human mind could come up with this idea. A clunking, Deep Blue-sized computer clearly spat out a reel of ticker tape that just said: “GREAT BRITISH BAKE OFF BUT FOR CRAFTS. KEITH LEMON HOSTS. OCCASIONALLY THE SET WILL ATTACK THE CONTESTANTS.” I genuinely fear what idea this machine will come up with next.

<p>A quick, easy, throw-together salad to welcome the start of summer</p><p>When the warm weather arrives, I don’t want to cook, but I do still want to eat something delicious. Hence, what classifies as a good, warm-weather recipe to me is one that uses as little time and heat as possible. Happily, it’s as if nature agrees, because fresh produce is at its most abundant right now. In today’s dish, I’ve used some of the season’s most refreshing ingredients – tomatoes, cucumbers and mint – alongside chickpeas and one of the most flavourful characters in the store cupboard, rose harissa, for a quick, throw-together salad that’s perfect to eat from a bowl on your lap in the sunshine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/30/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-no-cook-salad-chickpea-tomato-cucumber-salad">Continue reading...</a>

No, really. Its Covid ad is formed of an open letter to the country, in which various socially distanced members of staff say how proud they are of us. We’re coping well with lockdown, they say, and they’ll be waiting to take us on holiday again soon.

My next patient, an 89-year-old from a care home, is perilously ill. Despite the highest flow of oxygen we can deliver through his face mask, he is gasping for air at a rate of 40 breaths per minute, two or three times the norm. Swiftly, I search his hospital record for a glimpse of the man he used to be before coronavirus so violently reduced him.</p><p>In my mind, the voices from this morning’s car radio linger. Listening to the politicians and journalists talk – loftily, from afar, an Olympian perspective – coronavirus can feel like a mathematical abstraction, an intellectual exercise played out in curves and peaks and troughs and modelling. But here in the hospital, the pandemic is a matter of flesh and blood. It unfolds one human being at a time. And when the statistics threaten to throw me off balance – the unprecedented number of deaths for peacetime – I try to keep things as small as I can. Winston used to work in the local glass factory.

<p>It’s in no one’s interest for a billion-pound industry to fail – so why does the new culture taskforce hit all the wrong notes?</p><p>If British music has a soul, it resides in small venues. In hundreds of pub backrooms, grotty gig venues, DIY spaces and sweat-soaked basement clubs where lives are changed and, occasionally, history made. Alongside more established mid-sized venues, these places are talent incubators, providers of joy and a significant source of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/nov/20/value-of-uk-live-music-sector-hits-11bn">economic activity</a>. More important, they also crystallise, if not trigger, profound cultural shifts – and have for almost 70 years.</p><p>From the Beatles at the Cavern or the Sex Pistols at the 100 Club, to dubstep focal point <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/aug/19/fwd-happy-10-birthday">FWD</a> at London’s Plastic People (RIP), or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/cult-heroes-optimo-espacio-club-night-keith-mcivor-jonnie-wilkes-djs">Optimo’s</a> legendary Sunday nights at Glasgow’s Sub Club, we live atop a thriving, ever-mutating underground that shapes how the UK looks, sounds and<em> is</em>. That underground influences not just what you hear on Radio 1 and high-street fashion but – certainly until 2016 – it helped fuel the slow, undeniable rise of a more socially progressive Britain. From hardcore punk gigs to LGBTQ+ all nighters, spilling out of the communion of the moshpit or dancefloor flows a more freethinking and tolerant society.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/30/music-venues-british-culture-taskforce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Guardian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/12/like-the-open-university-we-now-need-an-open-school-for-the-whole-country">article</a> set out a plan to revitalise schooling after the pandemic. The BBC wants to take a lead, writes its director general<br /></p><p>The Covid-19 crisis has transformed all our lives in ways we could barely have imagined just a few weeks ago. In so many areas, we will be desperate to go back to “normal life” as soon as safely possible. But in others, however, what we have learned in this crisis will – and should – reshape our thinking for ever.</p><p>Educating the nation’s children is one of those areas. All of us have had to adapt to play our part – from the thousands of teachers who have been delivering lessons remotely, to the many organisations offering resources for free to the parents who have had to balance homework with homeworking. Society as a whole has stepped up like never before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/30/the-idea-of-a-national-open-school-is-an-excellent-one-the-bbc-is-ready-to-make-it-happen">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Millennials are said to be more narcissistic than any other cohort of society. A self-confessed self-obsessive works out whether that’s a problem</p><p>I was on the phone to a friend recently, blathering away as usual, when I realised that there was no one on the other end of the line. How long ago had this happened? I checked my phone and discovered, to my horror, that the call had ended almost five minutes ago.</p><p>In the pub with another friend, not long after this incident, I asked how self-obsessed she thinks I am – a question only self-obsessed people ask, along with our other hobbies: stalking ourselves on social media and planning our own funerals. Without deliberation, she concluded that I was an 8.5 out of 10. “OK…” I reeled, deeply offended. “But I ask about you too, right? I am a good friend?” Quickly, the subject was changed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/30/like-sound-own-voice-does-that-make-me-a-narcissist">Continue reading...</a>
