Why is it such a touchstone in times of chaos?<br /></p><p>In April 1936, three years before his death, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/28/irish-poet-wb-yeats-150th-birthday-celebrations\">WB Yeats</a> received a letter from the writer and activist Ethel Mannin. The 70-year-old Yeats was a Nobel prize-winning poet of immense stature and influence, not to mention Mannin\u2019s former lover, and she asked him to join a campaign to free a German pacifist incarcerated by the Nazis. Yeats responded instead with a reading recommendation: \u201cIf you have my poems by you, look up a poem called \u2018The Second Coming\u2019,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was written some sixteen or seventeen years ago &amp; foretold what is happening. I have written of the same thing again &amp; again since. This will seem little to you with your strong practical sense for it takes fifty years for a poet\u2019s weapons to influence the issue.\u201d</p><p>Yeats was justified in taking the long view. Written in 1919 and published in 1920, \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d has become perhaps the most plundered poem in the English language. At 164 words, it is short and memorable enough to be famous <em>in toto</em> but it has also been disassembled into its constituent parts by books, albums, movies, TV shows, comic books, computer games, political speeches and newspaper editorials. While many poems in Yeats\u2019s corpus have contributed indelible lines to the storehouse of the cultural imagination (\u201cno country for old men\u201d; \u201cthe foul rag and bone shop of the heart\u201d), \u201cThe Second Coming\u201d consists of almost nothing <em>but</em> such lines. Someone reading it for the first time in 2020 might resemble the apocryphal theatregoer who complained that <em>Hamlet</em> was nothing but a bunch of quotations strung together. Whether or not it is Yeats\u2019s greatest poem, it is by far his most useful.
