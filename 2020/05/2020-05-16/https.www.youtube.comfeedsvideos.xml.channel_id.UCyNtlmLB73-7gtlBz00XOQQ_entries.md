Clickbait Title: World's Largest Activated Charcoal Superfood Epic Burger Made With Acai Cake

In this video I mention Gourmet Makes a bunch and I actually felt really insecure about that just because for a long time during the edit it was feeling like I only had one example. But the reason it was on my mind so much is that the recent video with the gourmet Tater Tots was just so perfect with the intro where a parade of chefs, cooks, and foodies, the kind of folks who regularly cook hundred-dollar cuts of meat with obscure Italian names, stop by to talk about just how much they love frozen potato nuggets.
