<p>The prime minister's address to the nation on Sunday about new coronavirus lockdown measures for England was met with confusion by some. On Monday, speaking in the House of Commons, Johnson delivered a 60-page document clarifying the rules put in place to ease the country out of lockdown and limit the damage caused by Covid-19. Guardian political correspondent Kate Proctor is here to explain what the new rules are</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/can-i-meet-friends-and-family-uks-new-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-explained">Can I meet friends and family?

## The Magnificent One: how Little Richard's style shaped David Bowie, Prince and Elton John

<p>The musician, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/09/little-richard-dies-aged-83-rock-n-roll-pioneer">who died on Saturday aged 87</a>, was a pioneer in looks as well as sounds, influencing everything from James Brown’s quiff to Prince’s midriff</p><p>‘Little Richard scared my grandmother in 1957,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/28/john-waters-met-little-richard">wrote John Waters</a> in 2010. While his grandmother’s fear was largely about the singer’s sound – that trademark shriek at the start of his hit Lucille – his look had a formative impact on the 11-year-old Waters. It is thanks to Little Richard that the film director has the deliciously fake pencil-thin moustache that his fans know and love today.</p><p>Waters’ moustache is just one example of Little Richard’s influence on fashion and style. Images of Little Richard, born Richard Penniman, in his 5os heyday show a proud, decade-appropriate quiff – forget Chuck Berry and Elvis, this was the best in the business – plus a mascara-ed moustache, panstick makeup and the look of kohl around his eyes. James Brown, who was a Little Richard impersonator, learned the power of good hair from him. The Godfather of Soul began his career in the late 50s with a quiff worthy of Little Richard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/11/the-magnificent-one-how-little-richards-style-shaped-david-bowie-prince-and-elton-john">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Homelessness disproportionately affects lone mothers and their families across the country, but Shelter is doing all it can to help this group – especially in these unprecedented times of Covid-19</p><p>Despite the government’s temporary <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-support-available-for-landlords-and-renters-reflecting-the-current-coronavirus-covid-19-outbreak" rel="nofollow">ban on eviction proceedings until at least June</a>, Shelter continues to see families who urgently need somewhere to stay during the Covid-19 pandemic. Some find themselves in this position because of unlawful eviction by landlords and others because they need to escape violence and abuse. Refuge recently reported a <a href="https://www.refuge.org.uk/25-increase-in-calls-to-national-domestic-abuse-helpline-since-lockdown-measures-began/" rel="nofollow">25% increase in calls to its National Domestic Abuse Helpline</a> during the second week of lockdown.</p><p>Since lockdown, in line with government guidance, Shelter has, where possible, moved its face-to-face support to <a href="https://england.shelter.org.uk/housing_advice/coronavirus" rel="nofollow">online and local telephone advice</a>, so that those who need support can still access free and expert help. Shelter is receiving calls from desperately worried people, who cannot follow the public health advice because of the accommodation they are in. Despite this difficult situation, its frontline teams are working harder than ever to ensure those in need of support can access it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/shelter-supporting-those-who-are-struggling/2020/may/11/i-was-thrown-a-lifeline-when-i-was-in-a-dark-place-how-shelters-services-are-helping-homeless-families">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this weekly series, readers tell us about their favourite trees. This week: a flowering cherry tree in Essex<br /></p><p>This flowering cherry tree (<em>Prunus serrulata</em>) in the churchyard of St Peter’s church, Aldborough Hatch, Essex, is very special to me. A bitter cherry tree once stood on that spot all through my childhood. It was there when I joined the church choir as an 11-year-old in 1944. We used to eat the cherries, even though they were bitter, because there was hardly any fruit during the war.</p><p>About 25 years ago, the bitter cherry tree died. It was cut down and my wife Yvonne and I decided to replace it with a flowering cherry tree. It cost £25. After planting it, we watched that tree grow over the years that followed. Now, I often stand and look at it, especially when it is in full bloom, and I see it every Sunday when I go to the church.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/11/i-planted-this-glorious-cherry-tree-with-my-late-wife-it-still-connects-us">Continue reading...</a>

A celebrity interviewer gets famous people to hawk up gobbets about their private lives in exchange for promoting whatever project they have on the go. “So you’ve made a superhero movie – tell me about your divorce,” is my job, paraphrased. And most of the time, it’s fine: they get to promote their film, and I get to tell a good story.

This is not how heroines in young adult novels usually describe themselves, but then Alice is no ordinary heroine. She’s a 17-year-old pupil at an elite girls’ school, “an angry child’s crayon sketch of a human girl” whose self-harming is a cry of rage against what she perceives as a cosmic injustice: “Some lazy angel, desperate for a fag break, scribbled the wrong gender on my destiny forms.”</p><p>Before long, author Juno Dawson has whisked her heroine down a rabbit hole for an adventure that is both a retelling of Alice in Wonderland and an investigation of what might constitute reality in a society where money, power and celebrity are swept up in an ever crazier whirl of gossip, cocaine and cosmetics. But the central question of Wonderland is sane and sober, echoing that of Lewis Carroll’s original: “Who in the world am I?
