We’re all chomping at the bit for Elder Scrolls 6 news, but Bethesda’s Pete Hines has tempered expectations by saying the game will be coming out after Starfield, and we still don’t really know that much about that either. Needless to say, it'll be a long while before Elder Scrolls fans get anything substantial.  

The Mafia Twitter account has sprung back to life after almost two years of being dormant. Its latest tweet has given weight to rumours that a Mafia 2 remaster is in development and is set to launch in 2020 to mark the game’s 10th anniversary. 

Ubisoft has announced its summer digital showcase, promising exciting game news, reveals, and more. And a new partnership between numerous game publishers and developers will also result in another big summer event. The big gaming celebration will include involvement from studios like Larian, ZA/UM, and Paradox Interactive.

It's time to meet the best thief in the Outlands, Loba. The latest character to join Apex Legends.

When she was nine years old, Loba Andrade witnessed her parents’ murders at the hands of the simulacrum Revenant. Left to her own devices, Loba used her natural knack for thievery to claw her way into a high society life. With Revenant's reemergence at the Apex Games, she’s determined to use her unique skills to claim her revenge. And whatever loot she can get her hands on. 

Loba has a keen eye for valuables -- so keen she can see top-tier loot through walls. She uses her Jump Drive bracelet to teleport out of dangerous situations or enter lucrative ones. And she can even pull valuable loot to her Black Market Boutique, allowing her squad to load up on all the best gear.
