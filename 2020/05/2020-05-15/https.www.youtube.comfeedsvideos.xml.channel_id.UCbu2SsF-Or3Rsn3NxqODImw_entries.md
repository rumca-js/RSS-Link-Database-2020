This week on Good News Gaming, we celebrate the remaster of the Tony Hawk Pro Skater games with the greatest TikTok of al time. We also realise that time is a flat circle because the legendary Leeroy Jenkins meme turned 15 this week. 

There’s also a cool new way to look at Red Dead Redemption 2, thanks to a new camera perspective, and we become obsessed with a YouTube channel that makes gaming dioramas out of polymer clay. 

There’s also a follow-up to the DragonForce at 165% speed video from a couple of weeks back: the band’s guitarist Herman Li tries it himself. For more wholesome and funny things from the world of gaming, make sure to watch Good News Gaming every Friday here on GameSpot.

Persia visited 4 inspiring islands in Animal Crossing New Horizons and today, we're checking out the first two that will help get your creative juices flowing. 

StarmieGee is a Twitch Streamer and Esports Competitor with a love for Animal Crossing.  We tour POOM POOM and Starmie shows off her EDC themed island, talks about useful home-design tips, and even shared a special gift for one lucky commenter!

Our second island tour is Wabi-Sabi made by the amazing PeteFighter. His island is themed after Disneyland Paris and he takes us on an inspiring and hilarious tour of his take on the happiest place on Earth.

In her review, Kallie Plagge explains that "New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now."

In our next video, we visit our final 2 islands of these inspiring tours, don't miss it!

## Apex Legends Loba Tips - How To Improve Your Play With Season 5's New Character

Season 5: Fortune's Favor adds playable character Loba to Apex Legends. The teleporting thief offers a new support option to Respawn's battle royale game. However, instead of keeping her allies alive--like fellow support character Lifeline--Loba assists her squad with finding and securing the best loot.

In the video above, Max Blumenthal and Jordan Ramée talk about Loba and her abilities, as well as how to best use them to benefit her squad. Loba's passive ability allows her to see and ping epic and legendary loot through walls, her tactical ability lets her teleport, and her ultimate ability gives her squad the opportunity to loot an entire area from one location. 

After spending a few days testing her abilities and synergy with other characters, both Max and Jordan agree that she's a well-balanced character for Apex Legends. Though a powerful addition to the battle royale game, Loba isn't overpowered--her slow tactical ability and limit on how much she can steal with her ultimate ability keep her firmly in the support class, preventing the addition of yet another dangerous offensive threat. Apex Legends has too many of those already.

Loba isn't the only new addition to Apex Legends in Season 5--the full list of changes are outlined in the Fortune's Favor update patch notes. The new season makes several major map changes to Kings Canyon, implements a new battle pass, and adds a new story-focused PvE mode, Quests.

Sony's latest State of Play stream was all about Ghost of Tsushima, and the 18-minute presentation taught us a lot about how the PS4 exclusive actually plays. Tony goes into all the details in the video above.

The stream was divided into a few sections, starting with island exploration. Tsushima is full of points of interest and wildlife, including a fox you can pet at shrines. Combat is split between fast-paced samurai action and stealth-driven ghost sections. You can even experience the game in an Akira Kurosawa-inspired black-and-white film grain overlay, one of the game's many special modes. Ghost of Tsushima also features character customization, letting Jin wear various pieces of armor and Omamori charms.

Ghost of Tsushima is headed to PS4 on July 17. Developer Sucker Punch says we'll hear more about the anticipated game before launch day.

Persia talks about what know so far from Nintendo's surprise trailer for Paper Mario: The Origami King. As the title suggests, the first Paper Mario to hit Switch will have an origami theme, and a new ring-based battle system that mixes puzzle-solving skills with traditional turn-based combat. We also see Mario and Bowser team up to stop King Olly's plan to fold the world. Paper Mario: The Origami King launches on July 17th.

She also goes over details about EVO Online. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate looks to have been removed from the original lineup but exhibitions and other content is planned for all remaining games in the original roster. Four new games were announced for open online tournaments, including Mortal Kombat 11, Killer Instinct, Them's Fighting Herds, and Skullgirls. EVO Online is set to take place over the course of five weekends beginning the weekend of July 4th.

Phil Spencer's recent interview with Business Insider shows optimism about Xbox plans for the remainder of the year and into 2021. Spencer reassures us all that the industry will be fine as many games are in development. 

Lastly, Persia talks about Epic new free tools that will be available for all developers to enable cross-play support for games on any platform. Epic also has made Grand Theft Auto 5 available for free on the Epic Games Store.

This is your Save State for Thursday, May 14th.
