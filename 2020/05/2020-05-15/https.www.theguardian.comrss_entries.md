Thriller writer and journalist who relished the excitement and drama of the cold war<p>In Michael Frayn’s Fleet Street novel, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/24/fiction.books" title="">Towards the End of the Morning</a>, a smartarse graduate trainee scandalises a bunch of beery hacks by asking for a Pernod on his first visit to the paper’s local. The smart-arse’s prototype was the thriller writer Alan Williams, who has died aged 84. Williams had just joined the Manchester Guardian from the Cardiff Western Mail. “I never really lived that pastis down,” he used to say.</p><p>Williams had already pushed his luck more than once. In 1955, returning by train from a youth conference in Warsaw, he helped smuggle out a Polish student on the luggage rack. The following year, while still an undergraduate at King’s College, Cambridge, he delivered penicillin to Budapest during the Hungarian uprising, admitting afterwards that his real motive for going there was to witness a revolution at first hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/alan-williams-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former Gunners manager on his struggle with Özil, the language barrier and decisions that went against him</p><p>The plane from Baku flew through the night with no trophy on board and landed at 8am. Unai Emery went home to Cockfosters, slept for three hours, then returned to London Colney, where the players started arriving from midday, called in one by one. His first season at Arsenal was over. It had been “very good” he insists – repeatedly, in fact – only to collapse into a limp finish. Three defeats in seven days – against Crystal Palace, Wolves and Leicester – then a draw with Brighton cost them a Champions League place; that loss in Azerbaijan denied them the Europa League. Now the analysis began, preparations for the next stage.</p><p>Every player came, except Mesut Özil. Emery told them his plans and heard theirs: £130m was spent on signings, eight players in, 10 out, excitement building. But mistakes were made, he admits – from recruitment to the departure of all four potential captains – and within six months he was gone. Something had broken, the situation “unsustainable”, and he was sacked. He had overseen the best start in Arsenal’s history and their worst run in 30 years. As it disintegrated, he knew those games he watched alone and exposed on the touchline, toxicity all around, would be his last.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/15/unai-emery-arsenal-couldnt-protect-me-truth-is-i-felt-alone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Europe’s first elite league to return has planned meticulously but wants to make the most of its moment in the spotlight</p><p>Here we go. The phrase <em>Geisterspielen</em> – ghost games – is about to become part of international, rather than just German, football nomenclature because on Saturday the Bundesliga will become the first of Europe’s elite leagues to resume in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>It may not be the most endearing way of framing it but there is no escaping that its European counterparts are viewing the Bundesliga as their guinea pig, learning from their best practice and, perhaps, any mistakes. After a few years of spreading its wings, creating an international arm to the business and beginning to chase down the Premier League’s domination of global popularity, the Bundesliga now has at least a few weeks of a clear run at a hungry worldwide football audience.

Somehow, despite the remarkable enduring prominence of the dual role of Bruce Wayne and Gotham’s dark knight, the idea of honouring someone for being very very good indeed at dressing up as a giant bat to scare criminals probably has less chance of finding traction with the Academy than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/oct/28/uwe-boll-director-bloodrayne-alone-in-the-dark">Uwe Boll</a> has of coming out of retirement to win best film. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiiWdTz_MNc">The Joker? Well that’s another matter entirely</a>.</p><p>But this does not mean that the pressure is off when portraying Batman, far from it. Pull on the cape and cowl, and audiences and critics will still be mulling over your performance three decades later, as Val Kilmer and George Clooney have learned to their cost. There is no such thing as a cheap pay cheque for a forgotten movie in the era of on-demand streaming video, Twitter and the fanboy blogosphere.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/15/why-robert-pattinson-could-be-the-most-exciting-batman-in-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic has allowed strongmen and tyrants to get away with murder and mayhem while we look the other way</p><p>Under the cover of coronavirus, all kinds of wickedness are happening. Where you and I see a global health crisis, the world’s leading authoritarians, fearmongers and populist strongmen have spotted an opportunity – and they are seizing it.</p><p>Of course, neither left nor right has a monopoly on the truism that one should never let a good crisis go to waste. Plenty of progressives share that conviction, firm that the pandemic offers a rare chance to reset the way we organise our unequal societies, our clogged cities, our warped relationship to the natural world. But there are others – and they tend to be in power – who see this opening very differently. For them, the virus suddenly makes possible action that in normal times would exact a heavy cost. Now they can strike while the world looks the other way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/under-cover-of-coronavirus-the-worlds-bad-guys-are-wreaking-havoc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Late-night hosts on warnings from public health experts as Trump and Republicans press on with reopening</p><p>On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert recapped a week of troubling debates over reopening the country in Washington. “While Trump keeps trying to lure us out of safety, health experts are warning of dire consequences if we do,” he said, such as Dr Rick Bright, a former health department official who filed a whistleblower complaint claiming he was fired because of his opposition to Trump’s support of hydroxychloroquine as a coronavirus treatment. (It’s unproven and could have lethal side-effects). On Thursday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/rick-bright-testimony-coronavirus-trump-ousted-whistleblower">Bright warned Congress</a> about reopening too early, and recalled the dark moment when he realized America was in “deep shit” after a supplier told him they had run out of masks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/15/colbert-america-trump-coronavirus-late-night">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The PM’s struggles to deal with Keir Starmer may be why senior Tories are desperate to get all MPs back into parliament pronto</p><p>Does anyone know if Boris Johnson knows stuff about classics? Ancient world, that sort of thing? It’s so difficult to tell with a man who wears his learning as lightly as the prime minister does. But we must ask after a distressing – and distressingly well-sourced – <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9ed7a217-1462-4fba-9329-880dc76a3793">report in the Financial Times</a> suggesting that the reason senior Tories want all MPs to return to sitting in parliament like, yesterday, is because they feel their man does better when he’s backed up at the dispatch box by the only set of cheerleaders in the world you wouldn’t want to have sex with (I’m very slightly paraphrasing their comments). Poor prime minister. I believe the same thing happened in the Athenian agora to Socrates, who came across as a stuttering haystack unless he was supported by serried ranks of inadequates screaming “no, YOU are!” at his debating opponents.</p><p>Anyway, given that Johnson is our Churchill – the insurance dog version – perhaps it was inevitable that he would need a few nodding dogs on the frontbench next to him. All governments seek to disguise their own shortcomings, which is also why this one refuses to countenance a Brexit extension despite the vast economic shock of the coronavirus. Far from taking pause, the Conservatives are embracing the timing with the sweaty gratitude of a guy who knows that the unfortunate fire at a storage unit facility will take care of the corpse he’s been storing there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/15/boris-johnson-keir-starmer-frontbench-cheerleaders">Continue reading...</a>

I didn’t finish university, but had jobs throughout my 20s, which were fulfilling</strong><strong>. However, I never stayed</strong> <strong>longer than two years, thinking there was something better.</strong></p><p><strong>I had a shaky upbringing as one of three siblings. </strong><strong>My father was emotionally abusive, often did not have a job (my mother was the breadwinner) and </strong><strong>had affairs, which</strong><strong> my mother made us aware of</strong><strong>.

## Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt's Tituss Burgess: 'I’m the most boring of the rainbow of gay men'

<p>The scene-stealing sitcom star on how Tina Fey rescued his career with a role in TV’s kookiest comedy, and what he’s really like behind the memes</p><p>Much like the shows he started out performing in on Broadway, Tituss Burgess’s own life story is full of fairytale-style twists. On his last day playing the small role of D’Fwan, a hairdresser and reality TV star on Tina Fey’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2008/feb/07/30rockisthebestshowonte">30 Rock</a>, he went home to his studio apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, New York. “I remember getting on my knees and sobbing,” he says down the phone from New Jersey. “I was sad but I was praying that I would be blessed with another series-regular role, because I felt like I had finally found a purpose.” Instead, Burgess was evicted from his home and moved to a basement flat in Harlem, putting his TV career on hold. “Five years later, I get a text from my manager, and she goes: ‘When was the last time you spoke to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/sep/18/tina-fey-funniest-comedian-snl-liz-lemon-30-rock-sarah-palin">Tina Fey</a>? Because either you’re about to get a job, or this is a cruel joke.’”</p><p>His agent had received a breakdown for a character in a new ABC series (working title: Tooken) that seemed uncannily similar to himself: a down-on-his-luck actor and Broadway fanatic named Titus. Was Fey recruiting him for a lead role in her new show? Burgess still had to audition, having never been a series regular on network TV, but he landed the role, “and on my first day of filming, I was told to report to 52nd Street between Eighth and Ninth and that someone would take me to my trailer. My hand to God, my trailer was right outside of the apartment where I had prayed. It makes me teary thinking about it now.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/15/tituss-burgess-interview-kimmy-schmidt-netflix-interactive">Continue reading...</a>

Why don’t we include adverse reviews more often?

## Whiskey, addiction, breakups: Kalie Shorr is the new queen of country

<p>With her acid wit and poignant lyrics, the US songwriter is being hailed as a successor to Nashville-era Taylor Swift</p><p>Had everything gone to plan, Kalie Shorr would have just wrapped her first UK tour. Instead, the 25-year-old country songwriter is stuck in Nashville, diagnosed with coronavirus and fighting trolls who accused her of faking it for publicity. It’s the longest she’s spent at home since music became her full-time gig seven years ago. She has been writing songs with her two housemates but, otherwise, lockdown has been an exercise in getting comfortable with her own company. “I am very extroverted and thrive on chaos,” she says with a guilty laugh.</p><p>Shorr is no stranger to it. Her 2019 debut album, Open Book, documents the worst year of her life: her older sister’s fatal heroin overdose; a cheating boyfriend; an eating disorder relapse. “I’ve never been worse, thanks for asking,” Shorr sings on the album’s opening line. “Is it making you nervous, all this honesty?” Her poignant bleakness and acid wit (the latter honed at stand-up nights between gigs) did spook the famously conservative country industry. “They’re terrified to take a chance on something they don’t understand,” says Shorr. So she self-released the album, a gloves-off evolution of Taylor Swift’s Nashville years. It made the New York Times’ best albums of 2019.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/15/whiskey-addiction-breakups-kalie-shorr-is-the-new-queen-of-country">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The confusion sown by Boris Johnson has spread to Covid-19 testing and beyond</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest"> updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Many people I know are using lockdown creatively either to develop existing talents or to discover new ones. I appear to be the exception, unless you count working out how to do a Zoom call and worrying even more than usual as lifelong learning. The only skill I can vaguely claim to have acquired is how to cut the dog’s hair. Badly. A week ago, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/17/herbert-hound-has-adjusted-new-normal-wish-i-could-say-same-digested-week">Herbert Hound</a> was in a miserable state as his fur hadn’t been cut since Christmas, apart the odd trim with scissors around his eyes so he could see out. So I went on Amazon to investigate buying a pair of dog hair clippers, only to find that they are identical to the ones I use to shave my own head – excess hair is one of the few things not to have presented a problem for me so far – except the dog ones had a nice picture of a dog paw on the handle. So my wife and I got out my own clippers and took Herbie out into the garden. It wasn’t a total success. We started with me trying to keep the dog still and with Jill giving him a number 8 cut. Which appeared to make little difference, despite the large amount of fur that had collected on the patio. So we gradually worked our way down through the attachments before ending on a rather uneven number 3 cut – with the exception of the areas around the genitals which we felt required rather greater expertise than we possessed. Herbie has looked on us disapprovingly ever since, as if he believes we have made him the embarrassment of Tooting Bec common. He now doesn’t even bother to come into our bedroom before saying goodnight to us and clearly can’t wait for the time when we’re out the house more. Annoyingly, the new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/pets-at-home-under-fire-coronavirus-key-worker-school-childcare">dog grooming</a> salon rang us this morning to say they had just opened.

<p>Phil Taylor edged out rising star Fallon Sherrock in a wonderful match but darts, like any other sport, needs a crowd</p><p>Everything was different. The dartboards were electronic. The players were standing in their living rooms. There was no crowd, no raucous singing and the closest thing to fancy dress was the master of ceremonies, John McDonald, who had decided to wear a suit and tie but no shoes. Yes, everything was different, in all ways but one: when it came to the crunch, Phil Taylor prevailed, beating the rising star Fallon Sherrock 7-6 on Thursday night in the latest Darts From Home exhibition.</p><p>It was a wonderful match, as these things go. Taylor clinched it with a 167 checkout in the final leg, having trailed for most of the contest. Sherrock left empty-handed despite registering a paranormal three-dart average of 120, and twice coming close to a nine-dart finish. Even making allowances for the soft-tip board, with its appreciably larger treble and double segments, Sherrock offered plenty to suggest that she has been making extremely profitable use of her lockdown time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/15/game-on-why-darts-without-an-audience-will-never-hit-the-bullseye">Continue reading...</a>

## McDonald’s is back! Baby steps – give or take some Perspex screens – towards a type of normality

<p>‘Imagine: a burger picked up from a stranger and scoffed in your car. Maybe soon (dare to dream), you’ll actually walk towards those magical golden arches yourself’</p><p>As I described a warm <em>pain au chocolat</em> to my mother over the phone, I knew deep down that she’d probably never see London again. Like millions of others of her age and level of risk – 80s, lung problems – she is now scared to leave the house. The government’s campaign was a soaraway hit: 55 days of public announcements, playing every 10 minutes during ad breaks, have convinced her and millions of others to stay indoors unless their trip is vital. And eating pastries in public is never vital, no matter how you square it, even if they are so fragrant and fresh.<br /><br />As I talked her through the pleasing whiff of chocolate seeping from the window of a just-reopened coffee kiosk in east London, the passable standard of its takeaway americano and the joy of a waggy-tailed spaniel cross called Townsend whom I met proudly carrying his tennis ball home, I realised that in the new world perhaps one of my scant actual skills will come in useful: my powers of description. Perhaps from now on, and for many years to come, my restaurant column will be largely taken up explaining what it’s like outside the front door to folk who are far too terrified to leave home.<br /><br />Before Covid-19, my job was to put on shoes and pants and leave the sofa so you didn’t have to. I did not write reviews to charm chefs or captivate earnest food scene types; I wrote them for an imaginary reader called Tricia to read on the loo each Saturday while hiding from her own kids. Tricia went out much more before life happened – the babies, the budget, the tiredness; now she could live vicariously through the writing of a wastrel who was contractually obliged to go out and smile patiently at 11 courses of textures, emulsion and foam.<br /><br />But as lockdown loosens, perhaps my job, which is certainly ridiculous, might actually take on some poignancy. Britain feels divided into those who are ready for freedom and raring to forget Covid-19, and those who will never forget. The latter will not be rushing down Wagamama any time in 2020. They won’t do communal tables, touch the flappy menu or use the wine glasses. They won’t split a portion of gyoza with potentially Covid-drenched friends when they can Deliveroo them instead and eat them alone.<br /><br />As faint green shoots appear in the restaurant world, I wonder which side everyone I love will be choosing. Don’t get too excited, these are the smallest of shoots, yet still they’re visible. Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, will soon be doing takeaway food in its restaurants. And next week drive-thru McDonald’s is back! Baby steps – give or take some Perspex screens – towards some type of normality. Imagine: a Big Mac meal and a strawberry milkshake picked up from a stranger in uniform. Scoffed in your car, the burger box on your knee with salty fries balanced inside the lid. And then, maybe soon (dare to dream), the chance to leave your car and actually walk towards those magical golden arches and touch the interactive screen yourself.</p><p>How does that make you feel? Joyous? Scared? Angry? Will you be hitting the Hut for the pizza buffet this decade? How about the communal toaster at a Premier Inn? And, some day soon, bigger, flashier restaurant openings; new places specifically designed to provoke Fomo, offering new tastes, new trends, new flavours that will test the rigour of those most determined to stay in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/15/mcdonalds-is-back-baby-steps-give-or-take-some-perspex-screens-towards-a-type-of-normality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Guardian photographer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/christopherthomond">Christopher Thomond</a> has spent the last few weeks of coronavirus lockdown exploring Holcombe Hill in Greater Manchester - where he met local residents while exploring its multitude of paths, bridleways and moorland</p><p>“They say on a clear day you can see the Kremlin from here,” quipped the dog walker who had paused momentarily as he crossed the moor back towards home. The friendly passerby was clearly exaggerating but the views from Holcombe Hill are certainly far reaching. Below, nearly 3 million people are spread out across the Manchester conurbation and beyond, with the tallest buildings clearly definable on the city’s rapidly changing skyline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/15/on-a-clear-day-you-can-see-the-kremlin-from-here-the-hill-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>
