<p>Two years ago the photographer Palani Mohan received life-saving heart surgery. After his recovery he started to see the world and his work differently. He was drawn to images, old and new, that evoked silence and peace, and inspired reflection. ‘As we spend these days and weeks at home, I’m grateful for this time I have with my thoughts, and to witness the power of the small good things that surround us,’ he says. ‘My hope, especially in these difficult times, is that when you look at these images you can find a place for yourself within them, and be still.’</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/sep/09/the-last-rickshaws-of-kolkata-in-pictures">Palani Mohan: the last rickshaws of Kolkata – in pictures</a></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/may/03/be-still-12-images-to-evoke-silence-peace-and-calm-reflection-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The objections to restart plans are understandable and the game should pay attention, but ultimately clubs need to play games to survive</p><p>With each week the plans become a little more refined and with each week any final decision is pushed back. Football may return, and this is how it may look if it does, but nobody is sure, and any proposed date can only be provisional. Which is as it should be. In an age that often favours decisiveness over the decision itself, there is something vaguely comforting about a process that accepts the wisdom of waiting.</p><p>But in the background there is a crucial, nagging voice, and what it is saying is this: if football isn’t prepared to return, at least initially, in a form very different to the one it took before the virus, it may not return for a very long time – and for many clubs that means never.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/02/premier-league-critics-should-recognise-football-cannot-wait-for-ever">Continue reading...</a>

Apparently, the sky is no limit when it comes to honouring frontline health and care workers.</p><p>As an NHS doctor married to a former Royal Air Force fighter pilot, I know precisely how eloquent and moving a ceremonial flight can be – in particular, the military’s “missing man” formation. This aerial salute, usually in honour of a fallen comrade, involves one pilot within a small formation of aircraft abruptly pulling up and away from their fellows, vanishing symbolically into a blue vault of sky.

<p>The three-time Hugo award winner is one of the biggest names in modern scifi. She talks about overcoming racism to rewrite the future </p><p>In 2018, NK Jemisin became the first writer ever to win three consecutive Hugo best novel awards for science fiction and fantasy. Her first award had been in 2016, for her novel <em>The Fifth Season</em>, and its two sequels,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/11/hugo-awards-2017-nk-jemisin-repeats-best-novel-win-the-obelisk"> </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/aug/11/hugo-awards-2017-nk-jemisin-repeats-best-novel-win-the-obelisk">The Obelisk Gate</a></em> and <em>The Stone Sky</em>, won in the following years. Yet speaking on the phone from her home in coronavirus-hit Brooklyn, Jemisin says she never thought she’d be published. “I honestly didn’t think I had a chance. You just didn’t see characters like me in fiction,” she says.</p><p>Growing up in Mobile, Alabama and New York, Jemisin was an avid reader, making up her own stories from the age of eight, but the lack of black women writing science fiction and fantasy, the genre she loved, made her believe it wasn’t for her. “We were all exposed to nothing but white dude fiction, occasionally young white women fiction, and if that’s how you’ve grown up, then that is what is normal.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/02/nk-jemisin-its-easier-to-get-a-book-set-in-black-africa-published-if-youre-white">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coronavirus is the latest justification for extremism on the internet. Can two UK startups help solve the problem?</p><p>In the winter of 2002, nine months before Hanif Qadir unpacked his bag at a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, a group of men walked into the London MOT testing centre he owned with his brothers. They were collecting money for civilians caught up in the US invasion of Afghanistan; hundreds of children had been orphaned by indiscriminate bombing, the men claimed. Could he help? The appeal resonated with Qadir, who had lost his father when he was seven. He made a donation.</p><p>The men returned regularly. Each time, they asked for more money, before gradually changing the subject to Qadir’s faith. Eventually they invited him to a meeting at a local house to discuss the war in Afghanistan more freely. “I felt they were sincere and genuine,” Qadir recalls. At the meeting, the men encouraged Qadir to visit websites that claimed to show photographic evidence of violence against Afghan civilians by western troops.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/02/a-threat-to-health-is-being-weaponised-inside-the-fight-against-online-hate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Maybe there is something more we can do, aside from lying awake at 3am, and making the rainbow paintings</p><p>My sister is a junior doctor in a big hospital. I don’t have much to say about how work has been for her during the coronavirus pandemic, because she tells me nothing about it. Or, to be more specific, she tells me things are “fine”. This is how things are with us. I’ve always held out my problems for all to see, dumping them on friends and any poor sod who happens to sit next to me on the train, like a dog presenting its latest kill from the garden. But my sister operates in a lower key, as my parents and I discovered when she casually mentioned one night in her early 20s that she had been held up at gunpoint a year or so ago. She hadn’t thought to tell any of us at the time, because she didn’t want to worry people and, honestly, she was fine.</p><p>So I don’t hear much about the goings on at hospital from her, but I don’t really have to: I read about them in my newspaper every morning. Even aside from the whole global plague situation, which would be a big enough portion on any doctor’s plate, there are the now notoriously dwindling supplies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/coronavirus-ppe-shortage-doctors-face-hard-decisions-on-whether-to-treat-patients" title="">of personal protective equipment</a>, or PPE.

<p>The Essex Serpent author has been filling her days with sewing, baking and music - but not writing.

Authors on how to be creative in lockdown </a></li></ul><p>Some months ago I stood in the pulpit of Lancaster Priory and spoke on the virtue of art. What do we mean, I said, by “a good book”? I proposed that literature had use beyond pleasure, and that moral purpose was intrinsic to any book worth the cover price: the only way is ethics. I quoted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/02/the-lagoon-armand-marie-leroi-aristotle-review">Aristotle</a>; I burnished my halo. My duty, I said, was to write good books, and this was an act of love. Well, a haughty spirit comes before a fall, and I tripped on a virus, and fell into believing that literature was useless and I’d wasted my life in its pursuit. Even before the lockdown began I could not write. It baffled me that I’d ever done such a trivial thing. I have a banner hanging on my study door: “<em>L’amour c’est tout</em>”. It bloody isn’t, I thought. I never went in.</p><p>This is not to say I have been unable to create at all. With the privileges of comfort and time, I sew patchwork quilts, make bread, play the piano. This is common: “Everybody is feeling the same thing,” wrote Virginia Woolf of Londoners in the second world war, “therefore nobody is feeling anything.” Social media has become a village hall for the display of sourdough loaves and cross stitch samplers: fear and love sublimated into all the things we think our mothers did. What else can we do, inhabiting a place of present or anticipated grief?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/02/sarah-perry-what-good-are-books-in-a-situation-like-this">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The lockdown has led to a sex drought and falling sales of prophylactics. But there is unexpected light on the horizon<br /></p><p>Condom sales have taken a savage hit, as the opportunities for “intimate occasions” (in the delicate phrasing of the manufacturers) dwindle thanks to the lockdown. You don’t need an MBA for this stuff. Casual sex does not fit into any category of “essential activity”, whichever way you slice it. I think this is quite unfair, and signals a tendency to attach a negative moral judgment to sex that is so deep-seated that people don’t even realise they’re doing it.</p><p>Say, for instance, that you have two single nurses, who daily put themselves at risk of catching the virus, for no other reason than professionalism and humanity; those two people should, in my view, be allowed to have sex in a store cupboard, provided it is with each other. But I don’t make the rules.

## Fit in my 40s: 10-year-old girls love it, but will skipping work for me? | Zoe Williams

<p>This is a truly democratised activity perfect for our times</p><p>When I was planning to learn to skip, my main problem was a broken hand, and I had no idea what would become of exercise – the cornerstone of this huge fallacy of self-improvement in a crisis, plus one of only a handful of excuses to leave the house. Well, now my hand is healed(ish), and skipping is huge. I can see the appeal: on an atmospheric level, it is a truly democratised activity, as popular with boxers as it is with 10-year-old girls. On the practical one, it is, like all activities that use your entire body weight, a fail-safe calorie-burner. If you don’t already own a rope, they’re available on Amazon for a million pounds, if you’re prepared to wait until May (I’m being flip; you can get a perfectly good rope, fast, on eBay).</p><p>I already had a rope, and it was impossible, I thought because it was too long; turned out, it was because it was too light. You get much more feedback from a heavier rope, so your feet can feel it coming and react. Sounds improbable, but it’s true. Now choose a surface. I can tell you what doesn’t work: grass (too catchy); my kitchen (marble floor, bone-shaking; I felt as if I’d done parkour); my room with a carpet (fine, except that I made the house tremble). The dudes always demonstrate in a car park (search <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmYew1VwdbpHnSFG-CQ1A-A" title="">Jump Rope Dudes</a> on YouTube), and tarmac is kinder than concrete. Ideally, you want one of those spongy playground surfaces, but sadly, since lockdown, they’re out of bounds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/02/fit-in-my-40s-will-skipping-work-for-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Those brief features have long provided readers with a moment of connection that help us stay in touch with our humanity</p><p>Over the past few weeks, we’ve learned how to think a little more like epidemiologists. Each morning, we pore over statistical models that offer grim projections about how many people might get sick, when hospital beds will run short, how many might die within our age bracket. The coronavirus pandemic, in other words, has been a plague of statistics – and our expectations about the future have suddenly come to hinge on abstractions.</p><p>In opposition stands the obituary. These brief features, a cross between a short story and a death notice, have long provided readers with a moment of particular connection within the impersonal headlines. In a crisis of this magnitude, finding the emotional space to care about a single death can feel purposeless, unnecessary. But for many obituary writers past and present, there is a belief that this unique and embattled form of journalism can help us stay in touch with our humanity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/02/coronavirus-outbreak-death-statistics-obituaries">Continue reading...</a>
