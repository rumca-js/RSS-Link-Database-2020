The game has curated a lovely community as well, which we aim to celebrate in this weekly video series--starting with our favorite path designs.\n\nIn the video above, Persia talks about her favorite eight path designs and the creators behind them. From stunning black brick roads to rural tree stump paths, these designs are sure to help you capture the perfect aesthetic for your New Horizons island. We'd love to hear from you as well--let us know in the comments what your favorite path design is (even if it's your own; don't worry, we won't judge).\n\nIn GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review, Kallie Plagge writes, \"New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThe designs featured in this video include:\n\nBlack Brick design by user Zelda: MA-3689-2143-4570\n\nIvy Brick Path by user Kk: MA-2906-7843-7498\n\nIvy Stone Boarders by user Toria: MA-1264-3478-7702 \n\nBrick Boarders by user Udee: MA-9448-9193-5517\n\nTerracotta Round Boarders by user Melissa: MA-7011-8313-9106\n\nBlack Street Design by user TyCo: MA-0495-7028-1200\n\nTree Stumps Path by user Kaya: MA-0792-0805-1685\n\nStone Land Plaques by user Lupa: MA-9799-1853-4863", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30Ni-w5c8Lc", "date_published": "2020-05-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Apex Legends Season 5: Loba Theories And Abilities (Unconfirmed) Breakdown", "description": "Apex Season 5 has a release date, and we\u2019re breaking down Loba\u2019s \u201cLegacy of a Thief\u201d trailer to see if her abilities match the leaks, what easter eggs you might have missed, and how her story ties into Revenant's.\n\nApex Legends Season 5: Fortune's Favor is scheduled to begin May 12. As per usual, the new season will add a brand-new playable character to Apex Legends. Respawn has confirmed the next playable legend is Loba, a thief. Though Respawn hasn't announced what Loba's abilities are, we do have enough information to make an educated guess.\n\nIn the video above, Lucy James details everything we know about Loba--including her backstory, character design, enemies, and technology--in order to extrapolate theories as to what her passive, tactical, and ultimate abilities could be. In order to guess what Loba's abilities entail, we look at how Respawn has teased her involvement in the Apex Games, her in-game appearance, map changes that seem tied to her, and datamined character files.\n\nThis may go without saying, but not everything discussed in this video has been proven true. Lucy takes care to mention when we're talking about an aspect of Loba that has been officially announced or revealed versus when we're putting forth theories.\n\nAlongside Loba, Season 5 will add a new battle pass to Apex Legends that includes the usual cosmetic items, like legendary skins, but also provides brand-new rewards. Season 5 adds a new Quests mode to Apex Legends, which Respawn hasn't provided much detail for yet.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prYuGrKANgo", "date_published": "2020-05-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New Releases - Top Games Out This Month -- May 2020", "description": "Each week, New Releases takes a look at the top new video games coming to Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

This is especially true of the shonen genre, with franchises like Naruto, My Hero Academia, One Piece, and One Punch Man. Each of these properties presents fascinating worlds, charismatic characters, and interesting ideas that would work well as a game. And yet, in most cases, we keep getting boilerplate arena fighters.\n\nIn this video, Tamoor vents his frustrations with the state of anime and manga to video game adaptations, and remembers one particular example of it being done well. Why is he doing this? Because anime and manga deserve better, and he's hoping that others out there might see the video and feel the same. \n\nAdmittedly, Dragon Ball FighterZ was an excellent recent example of an anime adaption done right, but it's still buried under a pile of forgettable ones. Maybe if we complain loud enough someone will listen to our anguished cries for better anime games.

Clearly, you haven't seen anything yet--because this week, Byle the vile villager has decided to commit an even worse offense: Lie about Animal Crossing: New Horizons turnip prices.\n\nIn Episode 4 of Vile Villager, Rob Handlery and Jake Dekker decide to forgo winning employee of the month and tell their fellow GameSpot coworkers that the Nook's Cranny on Byle's island is buying turnips for 544 bells...when they're actually only going for 80. \n\n\"What's wrong with that?\" we hear you ask. \"After visiting MeatHouse island, you just walk over to Nook's Cranny, see that they lied, and then leave. It's only like a waste of 60 seconds.\" Well see, here's the thing. Rob and Jake didn't just lie about the turnip prices. They also built an elaborate obstacle course between the MeatHouse airport and Nook's Cranny so you actually had to waste a whole lot of time to only then learn that the entire ordeal wasn't even worth it in the first place. \n\nIn the video above, you can watch Byle build his diabolical trap, attract his would-be victims, dress up as a creepy jester (because why not), and then observe his prey scurry around to his heart's content.

The Nvidia Profile Inspector is used to tweak the graphics settings for some extremely un-optimized visuals. At first everything just gets shiny and smooth, but before long the Predator's cloaking technology starts claiming large chunks of the ground.\n\nCheck out the video above to see all the horrifying results, and check out Potato Mode for more mad graphics science with the latest games.\n\n#PotatoMode #Predator #HuntingGrounds", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIJ7S-6FGdQ", "date_published": "2020-05-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
