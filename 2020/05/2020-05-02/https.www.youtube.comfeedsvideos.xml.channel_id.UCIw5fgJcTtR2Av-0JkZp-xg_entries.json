(I tried to keep it low)\n\nEquipment used:\n- Elektron Octatrack MkII\n- Moog SUB37\n- Novation Circuit\n- Korg Microkorg XL+\n- iConnectAudio4+\n- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups\n- Teenage Engineering OP-1\n- myVolts mickXer\n\nMusic-nerd stuff:\nThis jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.\nThe Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+ (ica4+), which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit, Microkorg, OP-1 and SUB37. I had an issue with noise coming in from USB on the Circuit so disconnected it (which meant I had no MIDI synced start-stop) and I manually pressed play together to sync the Octa and Circuit. It's probably slightly off, but ok. Also, I experimented with MIDI sequencing from the Octa for the first time, so I didn't really play the keys, more sound shaping and stuff. Still figuring out MIDI live recording, which I would've preferred to do, at least on the Microkorg for the chords.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOGLML98uhU", "date_published": "2020-05-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
