They look at the surface of the phenomenon \u2013 the observable part, or data. Our approach, which borrows from physics and in particular the work of Richard Feynman, goes under the bonnet. It attempts to capture the mathematical structure of the phenomenon \u2013 in this case, the pandemic \u2013 and to understand the causes of what is observed. Since we don\u2019t know all the causes, we have to infer them. But that inference, and implicit uncertainty, is built into the models. That\u2019s why we call them generative models, because they contain everything you need to know to generate the data. As more data comes in, you adjust your beliefs about the causes, until your model simulates the data as accurately and as simply as possible.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/covid-19-expert-karl-friston-germany-may-have-more-immunological-dark-matter\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/covid-19-expert-karl-friston-germany-may-have-more-immunological-dark-matter", "date_published": "2020-05-31 10:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Living in the past: lifestyles from bygone eras", "description": "<p>Sick of 2020?

Radio gives us, as it always has, a constantly live event, familiar but ever changing. Whether you\u2019re a news junkie, a music fiend, or you just like silly chat, there are stations for you. There are phone-ins if you want to vent, pop quizzes for distraction, sing-alongs, help with schoolwork. Plus, if you find a show you like, a DJ can become a replacement friend \u2013 a warm presence chuntering in the kitchen corner, cracking quips over your headphones, blasting tunes out of speakers you\u2019ve put on the window ledge.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/31/its-what-people-turn-to-lauren-laverne-iain-dale-and-others-on-why-radio-is-thriving-in-lockdown\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/31/its-what-people-turn-to-lauren-laverne-iain-dale-and-others-on-why-radio-is-thriving-in-lockdown", "date_published": "2020-05-31 08:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "African nations fail to find coronavirus quarantine escapees", "description": "<p>There are more than 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the continent</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Police&nbsp;across swathes of Africa&nbsp;have failed to find more than a fraction of&nbsp;hundreds of people who&nbsp;have escaped from often unsanitary and uncomfortable&nbsp;Covid-19 quarantine centres&nbsp;in recent weeks.</p><p>There are more than 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in Africa, but low levels of testing means the true total is likely to be much higher.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/african-nations-fail-to-find-coronavirus-quarantine-escapees\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/african-nations-fail-to-find-coronavirus-quarantine-escapees", "date_published": "2020-05-31 08:00:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "George Floyd: protests and unrest coast to coast as US cities impose curfews", "description": "<ul><li>Police forcefully cracking down on protests across US</li><li><a href=\"\">Unrest comes to White House</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/trump-secret-service-george-floyd-protesters-white-house\">As protests rage, Trump comments inflame tensions</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/30/george-floyd-protests-minnesota-governor-riots-looting-police\">George Floyd protests \u2013 live updates</a></li></ul><p>Tense protests over the death of George Floyd and other police killings of black men spread across the US on Saturday night as mayors around the country imposed<strong> </strong>curfews and several governors called in the national guard amid scenes of violence, injuries and unrest.</p><p>After a Friday night that saw anger at police brutality erupt into rioting and unrest in cities across the country, authorities appeared intent on re-establishing order through increased shows of force.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-protests-saturday-curfews-minneapolis\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-protests-saturday-curfews-minneapolis", "date_published": "2020-05-31 07:42:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus test and trace system \u2018creating false sense of security\u2019", "description": "<p>Ministers accused by city leaders and local councils of launching operation before it is ready to contain local outbreaks </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Ministers have been accused of creating a \u201cfalse sense of security\u201d by launching a test and trace system that is not yet capable of controlling local outbreaks.</p><p>A series of concerns have been raised over the gaps in the system launched last week, with local health chiefs warning that they have not been given the time, powers or data to prepare for outbreaks in their area.

By the time <em>Nanette</em> aired on Netflix in 2018, Gadsby, now 42, had been performing standup for more than a decade, as well as acting and writing, but her blistering honesty, and refusal to let audiences off the hook, hit a universal nerve. <em>Nanette</em> was hailed as a #MeToo-era comedy game-changer, garnering awards including the (shared) best comedy prize at the 2017 Edinburgh fringe, introducing Gadsby to America and a wider international audience, and winning fans such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">Roxan</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely\">e Gay</a>, Monica Lewinsky and Emma Thompson.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/31/hannah-gadsby-you-dont-do-a-show-like-nanette-without-a-tough-shell\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/31/hannah-gadsby-you-dont-do-a-show-like-nanette-without-a-tough-shell", "date_published": "2020-05-31 05:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The best hotel restaurants make you feel as if you aren\u2019t  in a hotel", "description": "<p>Some dining rooms in hotels can be magnificent.
