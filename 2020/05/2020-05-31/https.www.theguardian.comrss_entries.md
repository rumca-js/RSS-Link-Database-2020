His wife, Hannah Gallagher-Bell, another nurse, is shielding because of diabetes and other underlying health conditions. The triplets –&nbsp;William, Benjamin and Florence, who are two and a half –&nbsp;were born prematurely and are vulnerable to lung infections.

<p>Coronavirus is driving more and more of us on to bikes. Here’s how to take the pain out of the commute or a night out</p><p>Desperate to get the country moving again, the government is promising a new era for cyclists, with pop-up bike lanes, car-free corridors and major investment to make roads safer across the UK. It just goes to show that sometimes you have to be forced to see the light. My own cycling conversion happened back in 2003, when the London congestion charge made it no longer possible to drive for free through the capital. I swore I would never pay it – and I never have.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the far bigger incentive of the Covid-19 crisis, this seems a rather shaming admission, except that it makes me an outlier. Most converts quickly fall by the wayside, but – apart from the occasional snowstorm, the odd multi-journey morning – I have never wavered, and that is because I’m not a zealot but a cycling pragmatist. I don’t cover huge distances – around 40-50 miles in a normal working week – but they are miles free from traffic jams and overstuffed tubes, and give me regular exercise while delivering me to my destination at a speed considerably faster than the seven-minute urban car mile. So if coronavirus is encouraging you to rethink how you get around, here are my top tips for a long and happy life on two wheels.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/beware-jeans-avoid-the-gutter-keep-your-saddle-dry-10-tips-to-make-cycling-a-delight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Being British meant I could never complain about standing in line. Now I’d rather take my chances at the garage shop than wait with everyone else</p><p>I wandered like a zombie into a social media argument about Kellyanne Conway, adviser to Donald Trump. I think I was looking for some outrage in public discourse I knew nothing about, to take my mind off the outrages I knew too much about. “People will wait in line for an hour for a Georgetown cupcake,” she said, “so I think they can probably wait in line to do something as consequential as … cast their ballot.” Her case didn’t look especially strong – taking the most indulgent and absurd thing that the time-rich, regular-rich person might sometimes do, and trying to extrapolate a voting system from it.&nbsp;</p><p>But I couldn’t keep my eyes on the bigger picture; all I could think about was the queueing. This is our life now. When I dream about chance encounters with lost friends, they happen outside the Co-op. On the great scroll of things we’re not really allowed to complain about, queueing is at the top. It’s a trivial inconvenience, in the grand scheme of the disaster. And it’s part of our national story, the one thing we are still supposed to be good at, after “sound governance” and “stiff upper lips” didn’t pan out so well.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/we-used-to-love-a-queue-but-that-was-before-the-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

They’re when she feels the most creative and can concentrate the best. But that’s not when her employer or society expects her to be productive.</p><p>“Going to bed at a ‘normal’ time feels so unnatural to me,” she says. “But society just doesn’t cater for people whose sleep cycle doesn’t fit the generic 9 to 5.” She has got into trouble at work for her timekeeping, which has led to disciplinary action. “I’ve had to write off so many events, meetings and opportunities, because they were in the morning and I just knew I wouldn’t be awake.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/extreme-night-owls-i-cant-tell-anyone-what-time-i-go-to-bed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The neuroscientist who advises Independent Sage on Covid-19 discusses the predictive power of his mathematical modelling and the risk of a second wave</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Neuroscientist <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=KJFRI52">Karl Friston</a>, of University College London, builds mathematical models of human brain function. Lately, he’s been applying his modelling to Covid-19, and using what he learns to advise <a href="http://www.independentsage.org/">Independent Sage</a>, the committee set up as an alternative to the UK government’s official pandemic advice body, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage). </p><p><strong>How do the models you use differ from the conventional ones epidemiologists</strong><strong> rely</strong><strong> on to advise governments in this pandemic?<br /></strong>Conventional models essentially fit curves to historical data and then extrapolate those curves into the future. They look at the surface of the phenomenon – the observable part, or data. Our approach, which borrows from physics and in particular the work of Richard Feynman, goes under the bonnet. It attempts to capture the mathematical structure of the phenomenon – in this case, the pandemic – and to understand the causes of what is observed. Since we don’t know all the causes, we have to infer them. But that inference, and implicit uncertainty, is built into the models. That’s why we call them generative models, because they contain everything you need to know to generate the data. As more data comes in, you adjust your beliefs about the causes, until your model simulates the data as accurately and as simply as possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/covid-19-expert-karl-friston-germany-may-have-more-immunological-dark-matter">Continue reading...</a>

Eavesdroppers might even catch the strains of Gilbert and Sullivan issuing from an 1890s gramophone as Michael Koropisz, a 24-year-old portrait artist who goes about his daily life as if he’s a well-to-do Briton of the 1890s, stages a tea party for fellow Victorian enthusiasts.</p><p>“We do get children pointing and laughing, and passersby taking selfies in front of us,” says Koropisz, who wears a top hat and 120-year-old frock coat, and adheres to a “pious” code of conduct.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/living-in-the-past-the-nostalgia-fans-who-feel-happiest-dwelling-in-a-bygone-era">Continue reading...</a>

Surviving as we are in an unfolding, dystopian nightmare, watching a man fix a clock is perhaps the ultimate escapism. In times of upheaval, we don’t want to be thrilled. The ideal feeling is to feel nothing at all.</p><p>Our interest in one of the biggest sectors of the last decade, post-apocalyptic fiction, will dry up now because “we’re living it”, says Lesley Thorne, the film/TV rights director at Aitken Alexander literary agents.

She lives in north London with her husband, Angelo, and their two children.</p><p><strong>What kind of lockdown are you having?<br /></strong>The silver lining is that I’ve spent more time with my children. But professionally, it’s intense. Everything we do really matters and is really scrutinised. Part of the joy of my job is the stuff that happens around the edges: bumping into people; picking up nuggets; talking to half a dozen backbenchers so you can get an idea of what they think about the government’s approach. You can tell how someone feels about a question by their body language – it might be just a flicker across a face – and without physical proximity to people, you don’t pick up on emotions so easily. So that richness and texture is gone – and also the fun. I love talking to people. I’m very gregarious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/31/beth-rigby-im-going-to-have-to-get-off-telly-soon-because-ill-be-too-old">Continue reading...</a>

There are phone-ins if you want to vent, pop quizzes for distraction, sing-alongs, help with schoolwork.

## South Africa's alcohol ban has given ‘massive boost’ to criminal gangs

<p>Prohibition of beer and spirit sales has cut rates of murder and violence but the resulting illicit trade will now be hard to stop</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The lockdown has been tough for David Mkoswe, a mechanic who lives in Alexandra, a sprawling township on the north-eastern edges of Johannesburg. Since Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa’s president, restricted the country’s 56 million inhabitants to their homes in late March, Mkoswe only earns if he works, and any savings are quickly spent.</p><p>For the last three weeks, there has been no money to buy milk for his nine-month-old daughter. “My little girl has been crying all the time,” Mkoswe, 38, said yesterday.<br /><br />But there has been another problem too. The strict lockdown imposed eight weeks ago included a prohibition on buying or transporting alcoholic drinks. “Within days, there was no more beer. Then there was no whisky,” said Mkoswe, who struggles with alcoholism.<br /><br />The lockdown is now almost over. On Monday, South Africa will move to “<a href="https://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/how-lockdown-level-3-will-affect-business-in-south-africa-48651685">level three</a>” of five, allowing many more businesses and some public transport to function under strict conditions.

<p> A new study shows that 60% of the world’s wars have lasted for at least a decade.

In Afghanistan, conflict has raged on and off since the Soviet invasion in 1979. America’s Afghan war is now its longest ever, part of the open-ended US “global war on terror” launched after the 2001 al-Qaida attacks.<br /><br />Yemen’s conflict is in its sixth pitiless year. In Israel-Palestine, war – or rather the absence of peace – has characterised life since 1948. Somalis have endured 40 years of fighting. These are but a few examples in a world where the idea of war without end seems to have become accepted, even normalised.</p><p>Why do present-day politicians, generals, governments and international organisations appear incapable or uninterested in making peace?

<p>From school to festivals, young people are missing so much – and all they get for their troubles is to spend more timewith their parents</p><p>However the current tussle between government, unions and teachers concludes, realistically there will be little or no “real” school before September, and none for my lads who, at 16 and 18, were supposed to be finishing exams and enjoying some kind of “legendary summer” (weeks in a dimly lit basement playing video games, sunburn at a festival and some kind of boring low-paid job, realistically).</p><p>This isn’t me having a controversial opinion about schools going back: I really don’t; it’s an impossible situation. I’m just desperately sad that we are where we are. It doesn’t inconvenience me personally, really. I barely see my boys for huge stretches of the day and I’m happy when I do. They’re lovely company, though the nine-meals-a-day regime is a drain on wallet and kitchen and I reflexively flinch now when I hear the words “What’s for lunch?” What makes me sad is that we are such a poor, inadequate substitute for what young people want and need: each other, the opportunity to do stupid stuff far from the parental gaze, and other adults.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/stuck-at-home-with-teens-here-are-a-few-distraction-tactics-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Full of knowing nods to space invasions past, debut director Andrew Patterson delivers a perfectly paced B-movie-style mystery</p><p>Director Andrew Patterson works low-budget wonders in his audacious feature debut, a 50s-set oddity that won the audience prize at last year’s Slamdance festival and was recently programmed for some socially distanced drive-in screenings in the US, doubtless adding a fittingly retro feel. Paying homage to a bygone era of television serials and sci-fi B-movies, the eerie night-time action– which plays out in close to real time – is lent a cutting-edge modernity by carefully choreographed kinetic camerawork that takes the breath away. Yet for all its sinewy visual panache, this theatrically wordy drama (from a screenplay by James Montague and Craig W Sanger) is at heart a radio play with pictures, pitched somewhere between Orson Welles’s infamous&nbsp;<em>The War of the Worlds</em>&nbsp;broadcast of the 30s, and the Wolfman Jack backdrop to George Lucas’s nostalgic 60s throwback masterpiece&nbsp;<em>American Graffiti.</em></p><p>It’s basketball night in the small New Mexico town of Cayuga, which like the rest of the US is gripped with tales of Soviet infiltration and extraterrestrial visitation. Fast-talking, savvy teen Everett (Jake Horowitz) is helping to set up the game’s recording equipment before heading over to local station WOTW (note the HG Wellsian initials) to present his radio show. Alongside him is Fay (Sierra McCormick), a bespectacled science enthusiast who works at the telephone exchange and is eager to experiment with her newly acquired reel-to-reel recorder. At their respective places of work, both hear a strange thrumming noise that seems to break through the ether into the airwaves. Meanwhile, reports of “something in the skies” coincide with mysterious calls offering bizarre explanations for the disturbances. Is Cayuga the subject of a foreign invasion? What have the US government been hiding all these years? And are our young heroes on the brink of a close encounter?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/31/the-vast-of-night-review-mesmerising-retro-sci-fi-andrew-patterson-debut-space-invasions">Continue reading...</a>

## Midnight rambler: the joy of walking around Britain after dark

<p>For a year, Matt Gaw hiked across the country at night – savouring the planets, the midnight light and the sense of earthly troubles shrinking into the universe</p><p>I still remember that first night walk in <a href="https://www.forestryengland.uk/kings-forest">King’s Forest</a> near my Suffolk home, two years ago. The clouds were smoking-room-thick, so there had been no visible sunset. The cold, white sky did not even blush. Instead, the light thickened and clotted as darkness began to form, seeping out from between stands of pines. It puffed from the shadows of my footsteps on the track and welled up from the deep ruts made by 4x4s.</p><p>I’m not sure why I kept walking that night. Partly it was just the rhythm: the metronome swing of the legs, the freedom of having nowhere to be and no place to go. But also, I’d been rallied by my 10-year-old son who, in his campaign for an ever-later bedtime, argued that an average human spends 26 years of their time on Earth asleep. His words had wormed their way into my brain. When was the last time I had been out at night? Not camping or running or toddling home from the pub, but <em>really</em> out into the dark. Was my life being only half-lived?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/31/midnight-rambler-walking-britain-after-dark-stars-planets-universe">Continue reading...</a>

It feels as if everyone else is having Zoom parties, quizzes and virtual meet-ups, while I’m sending the odd message and going to bed early after spending the </em><em>day talking to no one except my partner and one-year-old. In normal life, interactions with colleagues and “mum friends” helped disguise the fact I don’t </em><em>foster close relationships. Now that it’s all about keeping in touch, there aren’t many people who are bothered about a catch-up with me.</em></p><p><em>I</em><em> feel like a big part of it is caused by my relationship. I used to have an active social life, but when I left a very outgoing partner 10 years ago for my current one, that ended. He’s awkward, a terrible drunk and </em><em>not as cool</em><em>, so friends slipped away. I feel resentful towards him – as if he’s led me </em><em>to a life of loneliness.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/31/all-this-time-at-home-has-shown-me-how-few-friends-i-really-have">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Australian standup feared she would spook audiences with her frank examination of trauma, but it made her a star. With new show Douglas on Netflix, she’s taking risks of a different kind</p><p>Soon after she opens her new standup comedy show, <em>Douglas</em>, the Australian comedian Hannah Gadsby challenges the audience by asking: “If you’re here because of <em>Nanette</em>, why? What the fuck are you expecting of this show? I’m sorry, but, if it’s more trauma, I’m fresh out.”</p><p><em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81054700">Douglas</a></em>, now available on Netflix, is Gadsby’s follow up to her global standup phenomenon, <em><a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80233611">Nanette</a></em>. <em>Nanette</em> was a scream of visceral soul-baring, with Gadsby venting her rage and pain about being a woman, being gay, about homophobia (recounting how she’d been beaten up in the street), institutionalised misogyny, and more, all the while deconstructing comedy itself. By the time <em>Nanette</em> aired on Netflix in 2018, Gadsby, now 42, had been performing standup for more than a decade, as well as acting and writing, but her blistering honesty, and refusal to let audiences off the hook, hit a universal nerve. <em>Nanette</em> was hailed as a #MeToo-era comedy game-changer, garnering awards including the (shared) best comedy prize at the 2017 Edinburgh fringe, introducing Gadsby to America and a wider international audience, and winning fans such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely">Roxan</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/27/roxane-gay-writer-interview-literary-fiction-reading-diversely">e Gay</a>, Monica Lewinsky and Emma Thompson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/31/hannah-gadsby-you-dont-do-a-show-like-nanette-without-a-tough-shell">Continue reading...</a>
