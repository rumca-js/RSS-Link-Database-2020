We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They\u2019re recorded by the artists in their home. It\u2019s the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\n\n\nMay 27, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- For me, it was beyond surreal to watch Wire performing at my desk, in broad daylight, in 2020. I spent many an evening over the past 40 years, listening to their original, artful bursts of noise and imagery, seeing them in dark clubs in the '80s and beyond. From the time I first heard them in 1977, few bands have encapsulated my musical aesthetics like Wire.\n\n\nAnd yet there they were, with three original bandmates: Colin Newman, singing his enigmatic poetry, and those driving rhythms of Graham Lewis on bass and Robert Grey (aka Robert Gotobed) on drums. Matthew Simms was the 'new' bandmate, having now played with the band for the past 10 years. What's most remarkable is how the sound of songs such as \"Cactused\" from their 17th album, Mind Hive, sit so well next to \"French Film Blurred\" from their 1978 album \u2014 and one of my favorite records ever made \u2014 Chairs Missing.\n\n\nTry and imagine your favorite artist today, playing a concert in someone's office in 2062 and still having an emotional impact with extraordinary new songs. As I said, it's beyond surreal and genuinely thrilling.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cactused\"\n\"Be Like Them\"\n\"French Film Blurred\"\n\"The Offer\"\n\n\nMUSICIANS\nColin Newman: vocals, guitar; Graham Lewis: bass; Robert Gray (aka Robert Gotobed): drums; Matthew Simms: guitar\n\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, J.

While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Bettye LaVette\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/05/21/127043684/bettye-lavette-tiny-desk-concert\n\nFrannie Kelley | May 21, 2010\n\nWe were not prepared for Bettye LaVette's appearance in the NPR Music offices. We thought we were \u2014 having set up our cameras and recording gear and signed in all the friends who had heard she was scheduled to play and beaten down our door.\n\nBut then she blew into the room and conquered it before she'd sung a single note. She teased Bob Boilen mercilessly and told all the women how beautiful they were. She had reporters and producers doing her bidding all over the building. But after we cleared a spot for her to perch on the corner of Bob's desk, she went to work.\n\nThe first song she sang, a cover of Ringo Starr's \"It Don't Come Easy,\" killed the room. LaVette hunched her shoulders, dropped her chin and yanked the song out of her throat. It felt like a confession. Every movement she made \u2014 whether she threw her head back in a desperate wail or drooped it to close a phrase signifying defeat \u2014 shoved further meaning into the words. Her voice was bruising, shocking, and she sang really loud.\n\nBefore she began, LaVette asked us to close the blinds. It was 3 in the afternoon, but she said she was about to sing some night songs. She sang end of the night songs: \"It Don't Come Easy,\" \"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me,\" \"Nights in White Satin.\" (Due to licensing issues, only \"It Don't Come Easy\" is available in the video above, at least for the time being.) But she took those songs \u2014 glammed up and kindly lit in the recordings we remember \u2014 and tore off their clothes. She wrestled them to the ground. It was a real performance, from which each of us emerged a little sore.\n\nAt the end, LaVette's accompanist \u2014 Alan Hill, who had trained a gimlet eye on LaVette all the while \u2014 registered his approval. \"We should play more office parties,\" he said.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4YOIEg7U-c", "date_published": "2020-05-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
