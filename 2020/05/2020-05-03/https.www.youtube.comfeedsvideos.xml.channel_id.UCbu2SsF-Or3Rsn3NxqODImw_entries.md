Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the gift that keeps on giving, whether you're looking to hang out with celebrities or just need an outlet for your psychopathic tendencies. The game has curated a lovely community as well, which we aim to celebrate in this weekly video series--starting with our favorite path designs.

In the video above, Persia talks about her favorite eight path designs and the creators behind them. From stunning black brick roads to rural tree stump paths, these designs are sure to help you capture the perfect aesthetic for your New Horizons island. We'd love to hear from you as well--let us know in the comments what your favorite path design is (even if it's your own; don't worry, we won't judge).

In GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review, Kallie Plagge writes, "New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future."

Apex Season 5 has a release date, and we’re breaking down Loba’s “Legacy of a Thief” trailer to see if her abilities match the leaks, what easter eggs you might have missed, and how her story ties into Revenant's.

Apex Legends Season 5: Fortune's Favor is scheduled to begin May 12. As per usual, the new season will add a brand-new playable character to Apex Legends. Respawn has confirmed the next playable legend is Loba, a thief. Though Respawn hasn't announced what Loba's abilities are, we do have enough information to make an educated guess.

In the video above, Lucy James details everything we know about Loba--including her backstory, character design, enemies, and technology--in order to extrapolate theories as to what her passive, tactical, and ultimate abilities could be. In order to guess what Loba's abilities entail, we look at how Respawn has teased her involvement in the Apex Games, her in-game appearance, map changes that seem tied to her, and datamined character files.

This may go without saying, but not everything discussed in this video has been proven true. Lucy takes care to mention when we're talking about an aspect of Loba that has been officially announced or revealed versus when we're putting forth theories.

Alongside Loba, Season 5 will add a new battle pass to Apex Legends that includes the usual cosmetic items, like legendary skins, but also provides brand-new rewards. Season 5 adds a new Quests mode to Apex Legends, which Respawn hasn't provided much detail for yet.

Call of Duty has had some great weapons throughout its franchise, in every game, from CoD 4 to 2019's Modern Warfare there has been at least one stinker that was either under-powered or completely unused. Lets remember the duds.

At this point, the Call of Duty franchise has included hundreds of weapons, from archaic World War 2 rifles in World at War to recognizable ones in Modern Warfare, and some futuristic ones that doesn't even exist yet in Advanced Warfare and Black Ops.

While some weapons like the Intervention become iconic in video games, there are also those that bring shame to the armouries of their respective games.

After replaying every mainline Call of Duty title, Dave names and shames the worst weapons in the Call of Duty franchise history, pointing out those that needed buffs or updates and never got them, and remain terrible in games as recent as Modern Warfare 2019.
