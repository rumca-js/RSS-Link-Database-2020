After we wheeled one behind Bob Boilen's desk, it took the bulk of an hour to get the tuning just perfect for the very first Tiny Desk harpsichord recital. Given that our guest was Mahan Esfahani, the instrument's most ardent advocate, we were willing to wait.\n\nEsfahani, who grew up near Washington, D.C., but is now based in Prague, chose a double manual harpsichord \u2014 meaning two keyboards. This one was built by specialists Barbara and Thomas Wolf in 1991, but is based on a famous French instrument from 1770.\n\nThe carefully selected repertoire began with classics: a pair of sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti, which share the same key but couldn't be more opposite in personality. With elaborate curlicue ornaments in both hands, the opening sonata presents a sober, regal outlook. Its partner is a flamboyant rocker, with the hands chasing each other across the two keyboards like a cat and mouse.\n\nEsfahani made sure to also include a modern piece. Mel Powell's angular and slightly jazzy \"Recitative and Toccata Percossa,\" from 1951, is a tour de force in this artist's hands. It drives home a point he likes to make \u2014 that while the harpsichord had its heyday in the 18th century, it's still a vibrant instrument and very much alive. \"There are over 50 modern concertos for the harpsichord,\" he told the audience.\n\nReturning to the baroque, Esfahani closed with a little-known chaconne by Johann Pachelbel. Its steady bassline and colorful variations were a pleasant reminder of the composer's one-hit claim to fame, \"Pachelbel's Canon.\" Although the music stopped there, Esfahani's performance continued as he stayed for a while behind the desk, happily regaling the harpsichord-curious on the finer points of the instrument.\n\nSET LIST\nDomenico Scarlatti: \"Sonata in D, K. 534\"\nDomenico Scarlatti: \"Sonata in D, K. 535\"\nMel Powell: \"Recitative and Toccata Percossa\"\nJohann Pachelbel: \"Chaconne\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMahan Esfahani: harpsichord\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Tom Huizenga, Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineer: Josh Rogosin; Videographers: Kara Frame, Maia Stern, Melany Rochester, Shanti Hands; Editor: Melany Rochester; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Kisha Ravi/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMsTJo9yxGA", "date_published": "2020-05-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Abaji: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert From The Archives", "description": "We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Abaji\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/02/15/123533606/abaji-tiny-desk-concert\n\nTom Huizenga | February 15, 2010\n\nNot many of us were familiar with Abaji before he came to play this Tiny Desk Concert. But after he left, we all knew a bit more about music from half a world away, and a lot more about a big-hearted musician with a quick wit and a passion for instruments.\n\nAbaji's work spans many cultures and languages. With roots in Greece, Turkey, Armenia and France, he's at home strumming a twangy bouzouki, blowing into a breathy duduk or bowing a soft-toned kamancheh. When recording his latest album, Origine Orients, he played 10 different instruments, many of them simultaneously, with no second takes or overdubs. It took him just two days.\n\nAbaji begins with a song from the album, \"Min Jouwwa\" (\"From Inside\"), accompanying himself on an invention of his own, a tricked-out Western-style guitar with extra strings, giving it the sound of an Egyptian oud. He follows it with \"Summertime,\" with its haunting, serpentine riffs on the bouzouki and verses alternating between Arabic and English. Scatting in Arabic never sounded so natural.\n\nAfter the cameras shut down, Abaji hung around for a while to rummage through his menagerie of instruments, showing us \u2014 and demonstrating \u2014 a large duduk (an Armenian cousin of the oboe), an Indonesian suling (flute) and a Colombian saxophone (of sorts) made from bamboo that looked more like a snake. It was something like getting a lesson in world music from a good friend.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICBtVbDVinw", "date_published": "2020-05-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
