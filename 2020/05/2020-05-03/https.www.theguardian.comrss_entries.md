<p>More than a decade on, fact and fiction remain entangled in the tale of former teammates turned enemies. The human core of the entire episode, though, is not a footballer</p><p>Officially, nothing happened. This is, by the way, no minor detail: to this day Vanessa Perroncel fervently denies that any affair took place between her and John Terry in late 2009, and she has the printed apologies and legal documents to back it up. Normally this bit is begrudgingly buried at the bottom of the piece. But it’s worth dwelling on, if only because it forces us to confront the vast, incalculable gulf between what we definitively know and what, over the years, we’ve simply assumed.</p><p>A decade on, fact and fiction remain knottily entangled. Over time, the story of how Terry and his former friend and Chelsea teammate Wayne Bridge found themselves at the centre of one of English football’s most hysterical scandals begins to feel surreal, perhaps even a touch unreal: a bad memory that most would prefer to pretend never happened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/03/betrayal-and-bombast-surreal-story-terry-v-bridge-scandal">Continue reading...</a>

It has been incredibly therapeutic and healing to write it. I almost felt compelled to do it. It’s not about getting back at the police, it is about saying to other people who might be in a similar position to me: “I hear you, you are not alone.” It’s also a message to my former colleagues, many of whom are now in senior positions, saying: “These are the consequences of your words and actions, please listen and think.” But it’s not about portraying myself as a victim. I don’t want to call myself a victim because that would mean that it has all been for nothing and they have won.</p><p><strong>Do you regret having given so many years of your life to the police?<br /></strong>The biggest regret I have, which also blurs into shame, is that I allowed it to happen and that I said nothing for such a long time. I also feel a lot of shame that I joined the force in the first place and didn’t listen to the friends who warned me not to. Perhaps if my mum had tried to stop me I would have listened to her but she had respect for the police and she encouraged me. Now when I think about those wasted years, which I will never get back – I can’t describe how that feels. I lost everything – my marriage, my home, my income, my mental health.

From under a towel and behind a screen, Icelandic artist Gudrun Soley Sigurdardottir presents her show Elision, a contemplation of heat, change and togetherness. At the start of the show, which her audience are live-streaming from home, she considers what it means to watch a piece of theatre with others compared with watching alone. Community is an idea returned to in much of the work over the weekend at Gateshead international festival of theatre. Instead of being cancelled, the festival has been speedily but sturdily reimagined on a digital platform. Sigurdardottir peeks down the live feed: “Maybe we are together in some way.”</p><p>Making a theatre festival work solely online requires a heavy dose of trust, ingenuity and imagination.

<p>It started as a photo-sharing platform, but quickly rose to become the most influential app of our generation. Now, a forensic new book reveals the struggles and eccentricities of the men behind Instagram</p><p>One day in the autumn of 2015, a small but significant change was implemented at the Instagram offices in Menlo Park, California. Employees arrived at work to discover the rubbish bins under each desk had disappeared. The bins had allowed people to work efficiently – no one had to stand up to throw away a coconut water carton or wasabi pea wrapper after they’d enjoyed the company’s free food. But the bins weren’t really Instagram’s – they were installed by Facebook, which had purchased the photo-sharing app for $1bn in 2012.</p><p>Kevin Systrom, Instagram’s co-founder, didn’t like the bins. He didn’t like the cardboard boxes employees used to file papers and paraphernalia. He hated old, sagging birthday balloons. Instagram’s offices, he explained, after removing the bins, should represent its ethos. They should be beautiful, simple, pristine – much like the app itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/03/how-instagram-changed-our-world">Continue reading...</a>

Argleton vanished two years later. While its site was – and still is – a damp field in the middle of nowhere, it’s worth noting that Argleton is an anagram of G Not Real. Although Google never admitted to having created it, Argleton was a phantom settlement, planted as a trap.</p><p>In the world of digital mapping and cartography, snares to catch unwary plagiarists take the form of fake roads or places, known as “trap streets” or “paper towns”.

But then, just before I brought it to the table, I melted a generous slice of butter in a small pan and threw in a few flaked almonds with which to toss the hot couscous. The warm golden fat trickled through the grains and along with the crackling nuts turned a humble supper into a quietly luxurious one.</p><p>I have been keeping my shopping lists short. While the stores are mercifully uncrowded at the moment, shopping has turned briefly from a pleasure into something I no longer wish to take my time over. I’m in and out in a heartbeat.

<p>Video calls may be a lifeline but they’re causing all sorts of confusion in this household</p><p>We can’t claim to have had lockdown as tough as so many others, but some of our lowest ebbs have been about how much we miss family. Video calls help, but only offer a few brief moments of happiness for the boy before he gets frustrated, grabs the handset, turns off the call and navigates to the Netflix app for a fix of his precious, precious Peppa Pig.</p><p>Before lockdown, we’d managed to restrict his use of phones and screens for long enough that he didn’t really think about them. Now that screens are mandated for several weekly activities this addiction has returned, and with a vengeance. It’s a cruel whim of fate that the very thing we’re telling him not to use 90% of the week, we now have to force him to enjoy in smaller doses. These never satisfy his cravings, but still whittle away at the sobriety he’d built up. Imagine if the plot of <em>Lord </em><em>of the Rings</em> was just Frodo and Sam rousing the hopelessly ring-addicted Gollum from abstinence, forcing him into close proximity to the ring, refusing him even the small mercy of its absence, and frequently growing belligerent with him any time he reached out for it.

<p>Fifteen years ago, when the word podcast was added to the dictionary, only the tech-savvy were listening. Now, as star names pile in, they’re big business. Can the quality survive?</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/ask-the-pod-doctor-your-podcast-questions-answered">Ask the pod-doctor: Miranda Sawyer answers readers’ questions</a></li></ul><p>Hello friends! Do you fancy listening to “a new type of time-shifted amateur radio”? No? How about a brilliant podcast? Of course you do.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>, a magazine for fans of Apple products, announced, with limited fanfare, that Apple was about to add podcasts to iTunes, its music download offer. Unfortunately, few readers knew what a podcast was, hence <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>’s “time-shifted radio” definition. In June 2005, the idea of having thousands of ready-to-hear audio shows, anything from true-crime documentaries to all-chums-together comedy, to up-to-the-minute news to gripping drama to revealing interviews, and being able to listen to these shows whenever you want, wherever you are – well, that wasn’t quite happening. So Apple’s move didn’t seem important. Nor did the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary added “podcast” to its lexicon in the same year, after tech journalist Ben Hammersley came up with the term in 2004 (which was also the year the BBC launched a downloadable version of <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl">In Our Time</a></em>)<strong>. </strong>Podcasts were new. It takes time for the new to become everyday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/03/its-boom-time-for-podcasts-but-will-going-mainstream-kill-the-magic">Continue reading...</a>

There were immediate calls for a clamp-down. Not social media, but astrology. Not Covid-19, but the early days of the Second World War, as it became alarmingly apparent how much the British people relied on newspaper soothsayers such as Edward Lyndoe of the <em>People</em> and RH Naylor of the <em>Sunday Express</em> for their “news”.</p><p>Naylor’s advice for his readers as they anticipated the Blitz depended on their star sign: he counselled people born in January and November, for example, to take their chances in the open rather than underground shelters. The Home Office (Intelligence Branch) began an investigation and found that 40% of the population had some belief or interest in astrology and that a huge number of people were influenced enough to change their behaviour during air raids. The financial secretary to the Treasury called for “strong action to put a stop to this form of journalism”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/this-is-a-key-moment-in-the-publics-view-of-mainstream-news">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the UK celebrated wartime victory against Germany in May 1945, a landslide Labour poll win was only weeks away</p><p>It is through the photographs that we’ll imagine VE Day this week. Cheerful London crowds, thronging Piccadilly, packed down Whitehall, or pressing together down the Mall. Young men and women, their uniforms unbuttoned and their eyes blurred, dancing in the streets, crammed on to vans and buses, or splashing in the fountains of Trafalgar Square. Flag-bedecked street parties, the youngest concentrating on their celebration tea while the big kids and grown-ups, buttoned into their best clothes, turn to the meet the camera’s gaze.</p><p>But the apertured images simplify and limit the moment. Better, if you want to start to grasp the variety of what Victory in Europe meant, to explore the Manchester artist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jun/24/ls-lowry-tate-britain">LS Lowry’s painting VE Day 1945</a>. The cityscape is festooned with flags, crowds pack the squares and closes, and people pour out of the pub. Yet, away from the centre, the roads between the terraces and factories are emptier and quieter. Not everyone is dancing in a circle. A policeman watches. Someone walks the dog. A little girl, her head set firm, exits to the left on her own. In the middle of the painting, four tiny figures have scaled a roof and look out over the celebrations – trying, like us, to get a sense of the spectacle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/exhausted-relieved-yearning-for-change-britain-on-ve-day">Continue reading...</a>

My fresh-faced poppets are keen, ready for their young minds to be moulded and expanded. Yes there are challenges, but we are ready to meet them. The world is a great big classroom! “Mummy,” they say, eagerly, big eyes bright with excitement, textbooks piled neatly in front of them. “We just want to learn.”</p><p>Of course they say nothing of the sort: the younger doesn’t say anything. He keeps himself to a strict 20 words per parent per day regime in normal times and has maintained that discipline now. I don’t actually know where the elder is. Maybe he’s trying to stream <em>Ozark</em> next to the rock that gets a weak 4G signal, or waging war on the slugs devouring his seedlings?

## Why it’s good to be bored

<p>Nothing to do? Frustrated? Can’t summon the energy for even the smallest task? Fret not, says Elle Hunt. There’s a point to boredom, and it can offer us a chance to shape our own lives</p><p>I remember my first experience of boredom as vividly as my first kiss. The recollection is so clear I thought I must have been at least seven years old. Actually, my mother tells me, I was only three or four, which makes being bored my earliest memory. My sister and I were sitting in our family car, parked outside Mum’s friend’s house, into which she had disappeared. “Won’t be long,” she’d said. That had been 15 minutes earlier. I could do nothing but wait, but I wanted, strongly, to do anything else. I felt the bind on a physical level, the confines of the car consistent with the constraints on me. This was boredom, and I was appalled by it.</p><p>Neither the car radio nor my baby sister offered any relief. Then my gaze landed on a small hole in the velour lining of the car roof. One of the defining characteristics of boredom is that time seems to drag – minutes pass as hours. The inverse is also true: when we are highly engaged in what we are doing, we lose track. So I cannot tell you how long I had been happily at work on that hole when mum finally returned to the car to find the back seat, and both of her children, coated with foam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/may/03/why-its-good-to-be-bored">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The winger on taking penalties, learning English and his journey from a tiny town to winning three Champions League titles<br /></p><p>“It’s a strange feeling,” Lucas Vázquez says. “We’re used to competing, training, travelling, being together every day: 30 people, all the time. And then, overnight, you’re on your own.” On 12 March the Real Madrid basketball player Trey Thompkins tested positive for Covid-19. The football team had just turned up, but they did not head on to the field that morning. Instead, the club’s Valdebebas HQ was closed and they were sent home.</p><p>Seven weeks later, they are still there. Like everyone in Spain, they are in lockdown and Vázquez’s hair is longer than it has been for ages. For weeks no one has been out except to walk the dog. “By the third day the dog’s saying: ‘I need a day off,’” the Madrid winger says with a laugh. Next came the kids, released last weekend. And finally, this weekend, adults will get out. It is only an hour but it is something. Testing of players begins this week, a gradual return to training the week after. That, at least, is the plan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/03/real-madrid-lucas-vazquez-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A group of Californians keen to extol the importance of face masks during the deadly Spanish flu outbreak</p><p>This picture was taken in California in 1918, during the second wave of the Spanish flu pandemic that killed more than 50 million people around the world. In an effort to curb the spread of the disease, some states quarantined citizens; others made the wearing of face masks mandatory, at the same time as shutting down “all places of amusement”. According to a law passed in San Francisco in October of that year, on the day that state-wide infections passed 50,000, anyone seen not wearing a gauze face covering was subject to fines that ranged from $5 to $100 and the possibility of 10 days’ imprisonment.</p><p>Official advice insisted: “Wear a mask and save your life! A mask is 99% proof against influenza”. This was supported by advertising campaigns and jingles: “Obey the laws and wear the gauze. Protect your jaws from septic paws.” The people in this photograph were either a part of that campaign, or – carrying a sign reading: “Wear a mask or go to jail” – particularly keen supporters of it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/03/the-big-picture-spreading-the-message-about-the-1918-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

## The secret life of an anonymous speechwriter to the stars

<p>At work, I’m a ghost: always heard, never seen. But mastering the voices of celebrities and politicians helped me learn to speak for myself</p><p>I write speeches for people who can barely read their scripts because public speaking makes them nervous (statistically, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/10/30/clowns-are-twice-as-scary-to-democrats-as-they-are-to-republicans/">public speaking is the number one fear</a>, worse even than death). I write for people who are so compelling and beautiful that they could recite the alphabet and get a standing ovation. I write arguments that are recited in the House and Senate, in the seats of power. My words are on television and in stadiums that hold thousands of eager listeners. I’m not there at all. The speeches, toasts and rallying cries I write go further than I ever will: I may not be seen, but I am heard. The words that do not matter when I speak for myself are amplified when I put them in the mouths of others. Because as anyone knows, it’s not just the <em>words</em> that matter. It’s who says them, and when, and how.</p><p>Before I started writing for reality TV stars, musicians, political leaders and lecturers, I assumed that everyone wrote their own lines. Why wouldn’t I think that? A well-written speech sounds like the person who’s giving it. Or at least, it sounds like the person the speaker wants you to believe they are. Now I know that I was naive to assume that any public figure, even one who is a good writer, writes their own speeches and biographies and other ephemera. I’ve learned that you are probably hearing something written “in the style of” by a very talented mimic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/speechwriter-voice-transgender">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There have been some real beauties down the years, and not all the best ones were grand</p><p>Ah, hello. How lovely to see you. Welcome to the inside of my head. Forgive the dreadful mess. When you’ve got a few miles on the clock as I have, you do tend to acquire a bit of clutter. Ignore the problematic Sally James tableau over there; a little something left over from my grubby adolescence. And that bulge, draped in a dusty sheet, is where I keep all my sublimated fears. I try not to look under it too often and you shouldn’t either. Instead, come through to this lovely space. It’s where I keep all my favourite restaurant memories. Yes, I know. It’s as confused and tangled as everything else in here, isn’t it?</p><p>In these times, when our world has shrunk to its essentials, and many of the pleasures we take for granted have been wrenched from us, the inside of our heads can be a vital resource. I like to wallow in memories as if they were an orange blossom-scented bubble bath. I can wallow for Britain. I take myself stage by stage through the greatest experiences; the ones that didn’t just tick all the obvious boxes but which, at the time, let me live in the moment. Now I can live inside them again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/03/jay-rayner-my-favourite-restaurants-a-trip-down-memory-lane">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With so much time on our hands, it’s easy to dwell on loss, says Mariella Frostrup. Try distracting yourself with online dates, box sets and classic novels</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>Several months ago my partner of five years left me very suddenly. He’d gone abroad to work, but as far as I knew everything was fine. I even had flights booked to go and visit. The break-up was a huge shock that left me in a low place. </em><em>After a few weeks I felt I was beginning to come out of the fog and start moving on with my life, going out and seeing friends, going to classes, etc, but then the lockdown was imposed. Being shut away in my flat all day, alone with my thoughts, I seem to be going backwards.</em></p><p><em>I’m very aware that we are in the middle of a global crisis and it’s awful for everyone. Luckily, I</em><em>’m in a good position regarding </em><em>pay and I’m not </em><em>paying rent, so I really don’t have any reason to complain. However, all I can think about is my ex. It’s driving me a little bit mad</em><em>. Do you have any advice on dealing with non-</em><em>Covid-related troubles during this crisis? Talking to others about it</em><em> is hard</em><em>, and I don’t want to make it all about myself.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/03/my-partner-left-me-before-lockdown-and-i-cant-get-over-him">Continue reading...</a>
