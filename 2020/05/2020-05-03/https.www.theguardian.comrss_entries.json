Do you fancy listening to \u201ca new type of time-shifted amateur radio\u201d? No? How about a brilliant podcast? Of course you do.</p><p>Fifteen years ago, <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>, a magazine for fans of Apple products, announced, with limited fanfare, that Apple was about to add podcasts to iTunes, its music download offer. Unfortunately, few readers knew what a podcast was, hence <em>Mac</em><em>world</em>\u2019s \u201ctime-shifted radio\u201d definition. In June 2005, the idea of having thousands of ready-to-hear audio shows, anything from true-crime documentaries to all-chums-together comedy, to up-to-the-minute news to gripping drama to revealing interviews, and being able to listen to these shows whenever you want, wherever you are \u2013 well, that wasn\u2019t quite happening. So Apple\u2019s move didn\u2019t seem important. Nor did the fact that the Oxford English Dictionary added \u201cpodcast\u201d to its lexicon in the same year, after tech journalist Ben Hammersley came up with the term in 2004 (which was also the year the BBC launched a downloadable version of <em><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl\">In Our Time</a></em>)<strong>. </strong>Podcasts were new.
