But by her late teens, Bush clearly knew herself and wisely pushed for Wuthering Heights instead. When it saw the light of day, in early 1978, it was a hit. By March that year, it had become a No 1 hit, the first single written and recorded by a female artist to top the British charts. It replaced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/abba\">Abba</a>\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/all-abbas-uk-singles-ranked\">Take A Chance </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/29/all-abbas-uk-singles-ranked\">on Me</a>, and remained at the top for a month.</p><p>It is sometimes worth remembering the incredible fact that Bush wrote Wuthering Heights when she was 18 years old, though perhaps its keen ear for adolescent angst is part of what makes it so special.

Written from the perspective of the ghost of Catherine Earnshaw, a young woman pleading with the brutal Heathcliff, whom she loves and hates, to let her soul into the house, the song is a gothic melodrama that builds until it is thick with intensity. It is a magnificent achievement, though the writing of it was seemingly painless. \u201cActually, it came quite easily,\u201d Bush recalled later, telling the story of a single moonlit night at the piano. The vocal was said to have been recorded in a single take.
