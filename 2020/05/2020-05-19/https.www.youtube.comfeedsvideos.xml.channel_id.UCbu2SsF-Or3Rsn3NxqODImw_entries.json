After coming in second to PlayStation in the current-generation, Microsoft is hoping to start this generation off on a stronger foot.\n\nWhether or not Microsoft is successful in the next generation may even be more dependent on the Xbox Game Pass service than sales of Xbox Series X consoles, Eddie Makuch argues in a new video.\n\nIn the full video, Eddie speaks about how selling a lot of consoles is good, but the real money in games comes from software and services--and this is where Game Pass comes in. The full video covers how Game Pass could become the Netflix of Games, while it also touches on some of the issues and uncertainties related to Microsoft's strategy.\n\nWould Microsoft have pursued such a bold strategy had the roles been reversed and it was Xbox that came out on top this generation? We can never know, but it certainly feels like a watershed moment for gaming--and that's something to be excited about at the start of a new console generation.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8TYgCnQztU", "date_published": "2020-05-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath \u2013 RoboCop vs. Terminator Gameplay Trailer", "description": "RoboCop arrives in Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath May 26th, but he isn't the only metal man on the roster.

The conclusion to The Witcher trilogy is one of our favorite games here at GameSpot; it's a part of the small collection of titles we've given a 10/10 review score.\n\nIn the video above, Jake Dekker explains The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's history, including how the game influenced the industry and cemented itself as a modern-day classic. If you haven't yet played Wild Hunt and want to do so after listening to Jake explain how important of a game it is, you should check out one of his other videos next: The Unreasonable But Correct Way To Play The Witcher 3. \n\nIn GameSpot's The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt review, Kevin VanOrd writes, \"And make no mistake: this is one of the best role-playing games ever crafted, a titan among giants and the standard-setter for all such games going forward. Where the Witcher 2 sputtered to a halt, The Witcher 3 is always in a crescendo, crafting battle scenarios that constantly one-up the last, until you reach the explosive finale and recover in the glow of the game's quiet denouement. But while the grand clashes are captivating, it is the moments between conflicts, when you drink with the local clans and bask in a trobairitz's song, that are truly inspiring.\"\n\n#TheWitcher3 #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If5U5Z4qj2M", "date_published": "2020-05-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
