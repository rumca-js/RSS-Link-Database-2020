COVID-19 has the potential to ebb and flow with the seasons, but because it's a novel pandemic, that doesn't mean we're off the hook this summer.

While this episode was in production, an additional report was published in Science supporting the conclusion that too many people are susceptible to the virus for warm weather to make much of a dent: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/15/science.abc2535

Check out Nature: Spy in the Wild 2 on PBS (http://pbs.org/spyinthewild) to follow more than 50 animatronic spy creatures as they go undercover in the animal world. And check out their YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/user/NaturePBS) for more great videos of the natural world.

Birds fly, and fish swim. We learn this when we are children. But not everything in nature is quite so simpleâ€¦ Meet Limacina helicina, an artic-dwelling sea butterfly that flies through the water.
