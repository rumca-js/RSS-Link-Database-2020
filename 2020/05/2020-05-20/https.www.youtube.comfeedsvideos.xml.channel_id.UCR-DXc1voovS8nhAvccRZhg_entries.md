In this video, I show you how to find the new Raspberry Pis on your network and connect to them with SSH. Then I explain Kubernetes and the many different flavors of Kubernetes you could install on a Raspberry Pi.

Finally, I set up Rancher's K3s lightweight Kubernetes distribution on the Turing Pi cluster, make sure the cluster is working correctly, then show you how to shut down the cluster safely.
