<p>This film about Jesse Dufton, a blind climber aiming to scale a 450ft seastack, is a fascinating, action-packed account of defying expectations</p><p>Those who have not yet taken their tentative steps back into the great outdoors will find much to ogle at from the safety of their living rooms in the short, sweet Climbing Blind (BBC Four). It tells the story of Jesse Dufton, a climber with a degenerative eye condition that has left him with almost no sight. Three years ago, he says, he thought he might have to give up “lead” climbing (for outsiders like me, that’s going up first) completely. But with the help of his fiancee Molly and his own determination, he set himself a challenge instead. He intends to become the first blind climber to lead on the Old Man of Hoy, a gorgeous, imposing 450ft seastack in Orkney.</p><p>This is a film made by, and largely for, climbing enthusiasts, though it does the casual non-climbing viewer the courtesy of explaining everything that needs to be explained. Director Alastair Lee has made plenty of climbing films before and his wealth of experience shows. He is present in the story, because he has to be – to film a climb means being on the climb.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/20/climbing-blind-review-a-tale-of-tenacity-adaptation-and-hope">Continue reading...</a>

He was concerned, he said, that black people are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 in the UK than the national average, and he needed to protect his five-month-old son, who has had breathing difficulties. “It only takes one person to get infected within the group, and I don’t want to be bringing that home,” he said.</p><p>His concerns were understandable, but at the time he seemed to be being perhaps a little overcautious. The number of excess deaths among BAME communities has not been fully explained, but people from ethnic minorities are overrepresented in many high-risk groups, such as those employed in critical industries including health, transport and essential retail businesses, those living in areas of high depravation and in overcrowded homes, and those with certain relevant underlying health conditions. People from BAME backgrounds are more likely than average to be in poorly paid jobs, to be unable to work from home, and so to be forced for financial reasons to put themselves at risk of infection, or to be living with someone who is.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/20/deeneys-decision-to-stay-away-justified-by-watfords-positive-tests">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The brilliant creativity of British theatre must be safeguarded – and not just the great national institutions</p><p>Theatre has brave new thinking in its bones. What is it, if not the imagining and sharing of alternative worlds? But no amount of creative thinking can change the reality that theatre across the UK is on the brink. It is precisely what makes it so special that makes it so vulnerable – it depends on a real-time, shared experience, with performers and audience at close quarters. Put in economic terms, that means selling a lot of tickets to an audience sitting indoors, very near to each other. Theatres may not be able to reopen fully till at least much later this year, and possibly 2021.</p><p>With no income coming in, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/18/arts-funding-plea-as-shakespeare-globe-warns-it-may-not-survive-covid-19-crisis" title="">Globe</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/13/old-vic-theatre-perilous-matthew-warchus" title="">Old Vic</a> in London have sent out warning signals that they are weeks from collapse. Such theatres as these – with no public subsidy – are particularly at risk, being ineligible for emergency funds from Arts Council England. Those supported by public funding are not far behind, despite the furlough scheme: Nuffield Southampton Theatres called in the administrators at the start of the month. This week, the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh announced all jobs are at risk of redundancy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/the-guardian-view-on-uk-theatre-on-the-brink">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Some well-crafted action scenes are thwarted by a stilted script in Andrew Gilbert’s plodding post-apocalyptic thriller </p><p>This post-apocalyptic survivalist thriller, set in rural Britain, is both violent and depressing, with some iffy line-readings, weird script moments and untied plot strands. It isn’t badly shot by any means, with one or two effective action scenes and interesting use of remote locations, but it takes two ploddingly long hours to tell a cumbersomely inflated and often dull story, which even at the finish line has to be wound up pretty arbitrarily.</p><p>We are in a lawless, chaotic land where food, water and shelter are grimly scarce. A lone individual (Luke Hobson), haunted by his tragic past, makes common cause with a young woman (Georgie Smibert) and a desperate, angry man (Chris Kaye) to win out against a terrifying band of marauding cannibals and rapists, led by a brutal figure known as The Beast (Bryn Hodgen). They also get help from a couple, played by Nicholas Chambers and Susan Lee Burton who have their own reasons for fearing and hating these evil monsters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/20/edge-of-extinction-review">Continue reading...</a>

But eyes will lift eventually, and as that happens we will notice how the wider world has already changed as a result of Covid-19.

But there was a gripping reminder this week about one effect that is now more real than ever: the pandemic’s role in boosting the global heft of China.</p><p>The rise of China is of course not new. In some Chinese perspectives, it goes back centuries. Even from a western viewpoint it was already well advanced before the pandemic.

<p>No more Linda McCartneys in our house: I’ll be making my own banging bangers from now on – from a powder</p><p>I stopped eating meat five and a half years ago after getting close to a lamb in Turkey. I only spent a few minutes with this lamb, whose name, translated, was Courage. But, as these were the closing minutes of the poor lamb’s life, the bond grew very strong, very quickly, before being severed by the knife of its killer. Perhaps, though, the bond is actually as strong as ever, given that I think about him most days.</p><p>Until that point in my life, I had been a voracious meat-eater. Most evenings, my dinner table resembled Fred Flintstone’s. I am no massive animal rights campaigner. I am quite happy to sit with people who are eating meat, neither do I mind cooking flesh for friends and family if that’s what they want. I fear that makes me the Centrist Dad of vegetarianism. My logic is merely that, as I happen to be able to feed myself very well without any animals dying, I think it is the right thing to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/the-perfect-vegan-sausages-from-a-dry-mix-what-other-meat-free-joys-of-the-70s-did-i-miss">Continue reading...</a>

The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.</p><p>That wasn’t to be.<strong> </strong>Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-summer-temperature-warm-hot-spread-study-pandemic-a9506201.html">limited effect on Covid-19’s spread</a>. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/summer-holiday-no-10-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

## When should British schools reopen? Here's what the science tells us | Devi Sridhar and Ines Hassan

<p>We need to get children back into education, but a locally managed approach using testing and tracing is the only way<br /><br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The big debate over the past few days has been whether it’s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable. However, this isn’t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it’s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are <em>safe enough</em> to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.</p><p>In the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/bma-backs-teaching-unions-in-opposing-reopening-of-schools">teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/15/rushed-and-premature-parents-reveal-fears-over-schools-reopening-amid-covid-19-crisis">parents</a> alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of “test, trace and isolate” strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/british-schools-science-children-education-testing-tracing">Continue reading...</a>
