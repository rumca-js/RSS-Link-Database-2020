COVID-19 has the potential to ebb and flow with the seasons, but because it's a novel pandemic, that doesn't mean we're off the hook this summer.

While this episode was in production, an additional report was published in Science supporting the conclusion that too many people are susceptible to the virus for warm weather to make much of a dent: https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/15/science.abc2535
