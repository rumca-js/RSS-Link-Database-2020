The subtitle explains, \u201clike struggling to breathe\u201d, but you hardly need the translation. What we\u2019re watching looks like sign language, mime and dance rolled into one. It\u2019s actually visual vernacular, or VV, an art form little known beyond the Deaf community (Deaf, with a capital D, refers to a distinctive culture as opposed to a solely audiological condition). And it\u2019s part of a new film Here/Not Here by director Bim Ajadi, that finds connections between three seemingly disparate physical languages: krump dance, football and British Sign Language (BSL).<br /><br />Ajadi, who is profoundly deaf, brings together these three passions of his in a bigger story about three groups of young people who clash over the use of an abandoned warehouse space, with a script by hip-hop theatre pioneer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/16/jonzi-d-breakin-convention-on-my-radar-get-out-tribe-called-quest-slick-rick\">Jonzi D</a>. Ajadi explicitly wanted to bring VV in to the mainstream. He calls it a form of visual poetry but he could see the connection with dance and its potential appeal beyond signers. \u201cIt\u2019s a way of expressing visual vignettes,\u201d he says, through an interpreter over a video call. He describes how Deaf people growing up in the 70s and 80s, watching television with no subtitles, would take the shows in visually \u201cand almost have their own version of the story. And when they would communicate back to other Deaf friends they would describe that using VV.\u201d The gestures can work like a storyboard, with cinematic effects, zooming in or out or switching between characters in a scene.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/10/visual-poetry-taking-physical-languages-beyond-the-deaf-community\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/10/visual-poetry-taking-physical-languages-beyond-the-deaf-community", "date_published": "2020-05-10 12:14:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus US live: death toll nears 80,000 as Trump rages over Russia", "description": "<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/global-report-anthony-fauci-and-two-other-white-house-covid-19-taskforce-members-to-self-quarantine\">Fauci and two other task force members to self-quarantine</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest global updates</a></li><li>Get a fresh perspective on America \u2013 sign up to our <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/info/2018/sep/17/guardian-us-morning-briefing-sign-up-to-stay-informed\">First Thing newsletter</a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T12:11:13.611Z\">1.11pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak in the US, and of course the politics of and around it.</p><p>It\u2019s a fine \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/polar-vortex-brings-may-snow-and-freeze-warnings-to-new-york-and-new-england\">if surprisingly cold</a> \u2013 day in New York, still the epicenter of the outbreak in the US although as Andrew Cuomo said on Saturday, things are improving if still, of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/children-coronavirus-death-kawasaki\">vastly concerning</a>. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/10/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Here are the Johns Hopkins figures</a>:</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/mississippi-poorest-us-state-attempts-reopen-economic-strain-of-coronavirus\">'We can't stay home': how America's poorest state is trying to reopen</a> </p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/donald-trump-covid-19-coronavirus-us-healthcare-unemployment\">Under Trump, American exceptionalism means poverty, misery and death | Robert Reich</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-us-latest-news-updates-death-toll-donald-trump-russia-anthony-fauci-quarantine\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/10/coronavirus-us-latest-news-updates-death-toll-donald-trump-russia-anthony-fauci-quarantine", "date_published": "2020-05-10 12:14:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Charities call for safe routes for migrants to claim asylum in UK", "description": "<p>Record number of people confirmed to have crossed Channel in boats on Friday<br /></p><p>Charities have criticised the lack of legal routes to claim asylum in the UK from abroad after a record number of migrants were confirmed to have crossed the Channel in small boats on Friday.</p><p>The Home Office has confirmed 145 people, including 51 onboard an inflatable boat, were brought ashore on 8 May after making the perilous journey across the channel.

Its core message, asking the public to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives, has been very effective, but this has consistently been undermined by ministers and advisers inaccurately briefing the press that there is about to be a shift in policy. Before the Easter weekend, reports appeared that ministers thought that the public had been too obedient in following the lockdown, and that a relaxation was imminent. The same happened before this bank holiday weekend, forcing the government to clarify that there was no change in restrictions and that people must continue to abide by the law.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/the-observer-view-on-the-governments-lack-of-a-proper-lockdown-plan\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/the-observer-view-on-the-governments-lack-of-a-proper-lockdown-plan", "date_published": "2020-05-10 05:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Under Trump, American exceptionalism means poverty, misery and death | Robert Reich", "description": "<p>No other advanced nation denies healthcare and work protections, or loosens lockdown while fatalities mount</p><p>No other nation has endured as much death from Covid-19 nor nearly as a high a death rate as has the United States.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/03/donald-trump-reopen-us-economy-lethal-robert-reich\">Donald Trump's four-step plan to reopen the US economy \u2013 and why it will be lethal | Robert Reich</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/donald-trump-covid-19-coronavirus-us-healthcare-unemployment\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/donald-trump-covid-19-coronavirus-us-healthcare-unemployment", "date_published": "2020-05-10 05:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "What does it take to get really great service in restaurants?", "description": "<p>The first rule is, don\u2019t be a complete schmuck...</p><p>In the opening chapter of <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/wine-girl-9780349726274.html\" title=\"\">Wine Girl</a></em>, the hugely entertaining memoir by Victoria James, once America\u2019s youngest sommelier, the author describes a blood-boiling encounter with the kind of customer for whom involuntary euthanasia should be devised. It is a Monday lunch at the glossy <a href=\"https://www.aureolenewyork.com/\" title=\"\">Aureole</a> in New York and the host of a testicle-heavy table of four has ordered a $650 bottle of a serious white burgundy (a 2009 Chevalier-Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet).</p><p>Having checked at her serving station that the wine isn\u2019t tainted, James returns to the table and pours a small measure for the customer to taste.

There are only two bottles of the wine in the restaurant\u2019s cellar. James does not want to waste a big-bucks bottle when she knows it is perfectly fine. Instead, she presents the unopened second bottle, takes it away, then returns and gets him to taste the original bottle again. And between racist epithets, he declares it perfect, with a fat top note of triumph in his voice.
