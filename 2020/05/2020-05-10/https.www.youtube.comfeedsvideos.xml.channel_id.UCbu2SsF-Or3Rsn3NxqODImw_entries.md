It's time to meet the best thief in the Outlands, Loba. The latest character to join Apex Legends.

When she was nine years old, Loba Andrade witnessed her parents’ murders at the hands of the simulacrum Revenant. Left to her own devices, Loba used her natural knack for thievery to claw her way into a high society life. With Revenant's reemergence at the Apex Games, she’s determined to use her unique skills to claim her revenge. And whatever loot she can get her hands on. 

Loba has a keen eye for valuables -- so keen she can see top-tier loot through walls. She uses her Jump Drive bracelet to teleport out of dangerous situations or enter lucrative ones. And she can even pull valuable loot to her Black Market Boutique, allowing her squad to load up on all the best gear.
