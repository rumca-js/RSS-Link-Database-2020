OST for Top Gear 2 Amiga by Patrick Phelan (1994). This upload is intended for headphones only.\n\nJumplist:\n00:00 \"Night Train\" (Title)\n02:01 \"Topracertitle\" (Ingame 1 Auckland *)\n05:10 \"Top2\" (Results/Champion)\n05:56 \"Burn Rubber\" (Ingame 2 Ayers Rock)\n07:51 \"Destructive Comment\" (Ingame 3 Canterbury Plains, AGA version **)\n\n*) Looks like this track is missing from the AGA version.\n\n**) In the AGA game, this is the first heard ingame music (Auckland). There were 2 different 'Destructive Comment' tracks available. The one tagged AGA is larger so probably has some higher quality samples (or samples that don't exist on the OCS version). For this reason i chose AGA version.\n\nMade using real A1200 Rev. 1D.4 audio.\n\nVisit my channel for more Amiga music.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lujFa-Ysyc", "date_published": "2020-05-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
