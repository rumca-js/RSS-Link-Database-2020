We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They\u2019re recorded by the artists in their home. It\u2019s the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nMay 4, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Jon Batiste came to the Tiny Desk with some surprises back in November of 2019. Midway through his set, he stopped to say, \"it's the first time we're ever playing these songs, and it's the first time we're playing together.\" The New Orleans musician came to the Tiny Desk not with his late-night house band, but with an all-new cast. His all-female collaborators \u2014 Endea Owens on acoustic bass, Negah Santos on percussion, Sarah Thawer on drums, and Celisse Henderson on guitar and vocals \u2014 were an inspiration.\n\nAs is often the case when musicians perform in Washington (and especially blocks from the Capitol) the banter hinted at the political. Jon Batiste stopped to tell the NPR crowd, \"we're playing some music, and we're coping. The times are in an interesting place, but music is always that universal language that can bring people in a room together.\" Little did Jon know how those words would feel six months later.\n\nJon Batiste took us through some of the many sides of his rich musical history, from the soulful ballad titled \"Cry,\" to the jazz and hip-hop inspired, \"Coltrane\" and a rocking Motown-inspired tune, \"Tell The Truth,\" before ending with a bit of church with, \"I Need You.\" In just over 15 minutes, Jon Batiste bounced from playing the Wurlitzer to the electric guitar to the piano and then a melodica, all the while singing and sharing his talents and bringing us joy in interesting times.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Cry\"\n\"Coltrane\"\n\"Tell The Truth\"\n\"I Need You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJon Batiste: vocals, piano, Wurlitzer, guitar; Endea Owens - acoustic bass; Negah Santos: percussion; Sarah Thawer: drums; Celisse Henderson: guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith, Kara Frame; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, J.

While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Laura Veirs' Tiny Desk concert from 2010: https://www.npr.org/2010/03/01/124015786/laura-veirs-tiny-desk-concert\n\nMike Katzif | March 1, 2010\n\nIf Laura Veirs was in a songwriting rut prior to recording her lovely and spare new album, July Flame, it doesn't show. Perhaps the return to pared-down and simply constructed songs worked to arouse musical inspiration, because the record is among her best. For the most part, the songs on July Flame orbit around Veirs' acoustic-guitar playing and voice. But it's her idiosyncratic lyrics and melodic flourishes that imbue her music with sun-dappled warmth; hers is the sound of immense, wide-open spaces.\n\nAll the perfectly chosen instrumentation in the songs' arrangements \u2014 the fluttering plucks of strings, the subtle vibrato of a marimba, the stirring backing vocal harmonies, the swooping violins \u2014 come courtesy of producer Tucker Martine. There's a noticeable comfort between them; Martine has now worked with Veirs on her last six albums, and he seems to know just how to augment her delicate voice with just the right touches to let her shine.\n\nWhen a very pregnant Veirs settled in for this performance behind Bob Boilen's desk \u2014 a venue that can be a little awkward for many musicians \u2014 that same warmth and intimacy shone through. After a slight musical miscue, endearing enough to keep in the final video, Veirs and her small backing band treated the NPR Music offices to a three-song set that introduced us into her musical world.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fym6Yxbmki8", "date_published": "2020-05-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
