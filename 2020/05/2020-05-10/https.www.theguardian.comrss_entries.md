<p>Here/Not Here, a new film by Bim Ajadi, is aiming to bring the visual vernacular art form in to the mainstream</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/17/hottest-front-room-seats-the-best-theatre-and-dance-to-watch-online">Hottest front-room seats: best theatre and dance online</a></li></ul><p>Addressing the camera, Ryan Pendley’s arms swipe the air, his hands fly with ferocity and pent-up frustration, his fingers crawl up his neck and clasp over his mouth. The subtitle explains, “like struggling to breathe”, but you hardly need the translation. What we’re watching looks like sign language, mime and dance rolled into one. It’s actually visual vernacular, or VV, an art form little known beyond the Deaf community (Deaf, with a capital D, refers to a distinctive culture as opposed to a solely audiological condition). And it’s part of a new film Here/Not Here by director Bim Ajadi, that finds connections between three seemingly disparate physical languages: krump dance, football and British Sign Language (BSL).<br /><br />Ajadi, who is profoundly deaf, brings together these three passions of his in a bigger story about three groups of young people who clash over the use of an abandoned warehouse space, with a script by hip-hop theatre pioneer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/apr/16/jonzi-d-breakin-convention-on-my-radar-get-out-tribe-called-quest-slick-rick">Jonzi D</a>. Ajadi explicitly wanted to bring VV in to the mainstream. He calls it a form of visual poetry but he could see the connection with dance and its potential appeal beyond signers. “It’s a way of expressing visual vignettes,” he says, through an interpreter over a video call. He describes how Deaf people growing up in the 70s and 80s, watching television with no subtitles, would take the shows in visually “and almost have their own version of the story. And when they would communicate back to other Deaf friends they would describe that using VV.” The gestures can work like a storyboard, with cinematic effects, zooming in or out or switching between characters in a scene.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/10/visual-poetry-taking-physical-languages-beyond-the-deaf-community">Continue reading...</a>

## I Break Horses: Warnings review – more woozy synthscapes

<p>(Bella Union)</p><p>Having started out as a My Bloody Valentine-indebted shoegaze duo, <a href="https://www.ibreakhorses.se/">I Break Horses</a> had become a solo vehicle for Swedish singer-songwriter Maria Lindén by the time of 2014’s rather more electronica-influenced second album, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/12/break-horses-chiaroscuro-maria-linden-review">Chiaroscuro</a></em>. The six years since have been notable chiefly for a series of false starts: collaborations that didn’t come off, two years’ work lost on a crashed hard drive. But despite a new creative foil in producer Chris Coady (Beach House, TV on the Radio), the long gestation period of this third album<em> </em>hasn’t brought about any quantum leaps in style: <em>Warnings</em> majors in the sort of gently woozy homemade synthscapes that defined its predecessor.</p><p>The record is most effective when Lindén sounds more animated, as on<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTuJZjRhs-E"> I’ll Be the Death of You</a> and the nimble, propulsive, Kraftwerk-influenced Neon Lights. Unfortunately these moments are overshadowed by lengthier excursions that give longueurs a bad name. The opener, Turn, details the aftermath of a relationship gone sour, but the cloyingly tinkling synths and funereal pace make its nine ponderous minutes feel like an endurance test. Lead single Death Engine is similarly overegged, and the three instrumental interstices anaesthetise the palate rather than cleanse it. There’s the kernel of a good album here – but it’s no more than that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/10/i-break-horses-warnings-review-more-woozy-synthscapes-maria-linden">Continue reading...</a>

## I thought I'd have coronavirus crafting all sewn up – but it was a creative calamity | Eleanor Margolis

<p>With a lockdown boom in wholesomely mindful hobbies, I had a go myself. My stress levels quickly went through the roof</p><p>Of all of the strange side effects of the pandemic, I suppose the craft boom was inevitable. The mindfulness industry (which goes hand in hand with sewing, knitting and the like) was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality">already thriving</a> before lockdown sent our levels of boredom and anxiety through the roof. Now, we’re seeing something of a craft renaissance: John Lewis’s haberdashery sales have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/04/a-good-yarn-uk-coronavirus-lockdown-spawns-arts-and-craft-renaissance">reported an online boost</a>, while Hobbycraft, that stalwart of the craft-industrial complex, has said the number of people visiting its website for crafting ideas has tripled since the lockdown began. For every sourdough starter, there’s also a handmade face mask or a piece of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/tiger-king-reflects-our-world-back-to-us-one-run-by-megalomaniacs-and-amateurs">Tiger King</a><em>-</em>inspired embroidery.</p><p>It’s not difficult to see why people turn to crafts in times of crisis. During a particularly potent spell of unemployment in my early 20s, I took to making little people out of tampons. It started when, unable to sleep one night, I gathered up all the “crafting” materials I could find in my room (some felt tips and a box of Tampax) and turned five tampons into the Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. This was, it should be said, in the wake of the twee-core explosion of the late 2000s, when doing this sort of thing was considered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2014/jul/16/why-the-manic-pixie-dream-girl-must-never-return">Zooey Deschanel-esque</a>, and therefore good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/coronavirus-crafting-sewn-up-creative-calamity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Glaswegian comedian’s voiceover videos are a lockdown hit – not least with Nicola Sturgeon</p><p>Janey Godley is having a productive lockdown. The 59-year-old comedian has had a run of viral (in the good sense) hits with her sweary and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/janeygodley/videos">very funny voiceovers</a>, typically overdubs of recent press briefings given by Nicola Sturgeon, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. A former pub landlady, Godley became a standup comic at the age of 35, and her material often references her early experienceof violence and abuse. She lives in her native Glasgow and records near-daily Facebook Live updates and <a href="https://janeygodley.podomatic.com/?utm_source=web-player&amp;utm_medium=podcast-link">podcasts</a> from the flat she shares with her husband, their daughter – the comedian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/14/fringe-edinburgh-festival--family-comic-dynasties">Ashley Storrie</a> – and dachshund Honey.</p><p><strong>Why are people responding to your voiceovers?<br /></strong>I think because we’ve become so exhausted by looking at the news. You see Boris talking, you see Nicola Sturgeon talking, and you could turn the volume down and not learn anything more. So I just translate it into what they’re actually saying. And that is: “Shut the fuck up, stop moaning, stay in the house, wash your hands, and if I see any of you then I’m going to give you a kick up the crack of your arse.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/10/janey-godley-i-translate-the-news-into-what-politicians-are-actually-saying">Continue reading...</a>

Jackie Cox and Heidi Aphrodite lipsynced last week and neither went home, apparently because they’re both just too good! While this was a huge relief for both girls, imagine being one of the others.

<p>The Swedish author, whose life was laid bare in controversial novels by her ex-husband, is successfully reviving her own career</p><p>Linda Boström Knausgård is sitting at a corner table in a London cafe a few days before lockdown. Slender, pale and serious in a high-necked cream blouse, she looks like a character in an Ibsen play. This is apt in more ways than one, for as hundreds of thousands of readers know from the books written by her ex-husband, Boström’s life has been as full of dark, domestic and psychological drama as any of her fellow Scandinavian’s heroines. But the Swedish poet and author is here to tell me that she is through with being a character in someone else’s novels. “I am finding my own language and it feels good. I feel free,” she says.</p><p>The ex-husband in question is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-ove-knausgard">Karl Ove Knausgå</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/karl-ove-knausgard">rd</a>, the Norwegian writer whose six-part series of autobiographical novels, <em>My Struggle</em>, became a worldwide literary sensation over the past decade. As well as documenting his own daily life in minute detail – from the kind of cigarettes he smokes to the grim alcoholic death of his father – the books laid bare Boström’s lowest and most intimate moments. When we meet, I feel I already know more about her than I do about some of my closest friends.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/10/linda-bostrom-knausgard-i-would-like-to-be-seen-as-a-person-and-author-in-my-own-right">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After the pandemic, EU citizens must seize the moment to build a democracy of equals who share the same protections </p><p>In 1933, the year of the Nazi takeover, the French writer Julien Benda wrote his Discourse to the European Nation,<em> </em>urging Europeans to come together around their shared universalist values and against the rising monsters of nationalism. As Europe marched towards the murder of its soul and its people, many dared to dream the impossible.</p><p>Benda was not alone. The Ventotene manifesto, one of the founding texts of European federalism, was drafted in 1941. And it was against the background of a continent in ruins that Churchill spoke of a “United States of Europe” in 1946. The rebirth of Europe would have been unthinkable if the flame of European unity had not been kept alive throughout the continent’s darkest hour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/10/elites-failed-create-european-republic-pandemic-eu-citizens-democracy-equals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Toast is a great go-to. Why not turn it into a proper feast?</p><p>Toast, in one form or another, has become even more of a comfort than usual. Lavishly buttered or glistening with olive oil, of course, but oh so much more than that. Toast tucked under a pile of pak choi or spinach that you have sautéed with olive oil, lemon juice, dried chilli flakes and pepper. Toast to sneak under a mound of mushrooms fried in butter and thyme. And, using up the weekend roast, toast to cushion a sauce made with leftover chicken, browned onions, sage and cream. Best of all was a blue cheese sauce, properly made with bay-infused milk into which I folded steamed spinach and fat butter beans from a tin.</p><p>Toast has been a lockdown go-to partly for its ability to make a light dish more substantial. The trusty crust that sits under a piece of grilled lamb belly or roasted red peppers and soaks up their garlicky, herby juices. The thickly cut chewy bread that lends heft to a light lunch of taglierini, basil and crushed tomatoes, or acts as a delicious raft on which to sit a vast, wobbling spoonful of parmesan soufflé.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/10/nigel-slater-comforting-toast-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

Their son, meanwhile, had sneaked into his parents’ bedroom, desperate not to attract the attention of the grown-ups.</p><p>A few hours later, emotions overwhelmed him.

Such gentlemanly discretion, in the social media age of self-promotional disclosure, is much to be admired, like a rose blooming in some discarded shit-pants.

<p>Providing all the stimulation a young mind needs is tricky when he’s happy behind the sofa</p><p>It’s hard to know how much lockdown is affecting my son. He’s now 22 months old and at this stage looks likely to be spending his second birthday in some form of quarantine or other. In a lot of ways, he got used to it quicker than we did, and we didn’t take much longer after that. One of the strangest parts of this whole saga has been how quickly it all became normal, barring my incessant longing for a mediocre meal in a mid-price Italian restaurant, and the constant low-level worry that he’s being starved of stimulus and will emerge from all this woefully behind all his friends because their mums and dads were actually good parents and had a nine-hour course of cultural delights planned each day.</p><p>It doesn’t help that so many of the ‘great ideas for young kids’ you see online are so complex and labour intensive, and when we try them on him he seems resolutely uninterested and happy to continue doing his same old thing. We read to him, play games, do painting and building, speak to him all day in full sentences and try to keep screens to a minimum. We video-call his nana and grandad and make sure he has a little run-around in the park for half an hour every day. But we still fear it’s not enough. That we’re not enough, and he’ll arrive at his first day back at playgroup saying ‘nee naw’ at his new fire engine, while all his playmates are tuning their violas and punning in Greek.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/10/beating-boredom-is-the-first-rule-of-toddler-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic has thrown publishing and booksellers into crisis – and left customers struggling to obtain books when they most want them. But some in the industry sense an opportunity to drag it into the 21st century</p><p>On 18 March, Emma Corfield-Walters received the news that for the second year running, her shop, Book-ish, in Crickhowell in the Brecon Beacons, had landed the title for Wales in the regional round of the independent bookshop of the year award. Corfield-Walters has run <a href="https://www.book-ish.co.uk/online_shop/">Book-ish</a> for 10 years. It has 16 staff and a cafe, is the base for a literary festival that she also organises, and is credited with having played a major part in the regeneration of Crickhowell’s award-winning high street. Above all, it is a highly successful business: 2019 was a record year. The fact that it would now again be a contender for the overall prize – to be announced in June at the British book awards – was for Corfield-Walters a hard-earned affirmation of a decade’s passion and work.</p><p>But she was hardly celebrating. Britain was then five days from lockdown. “It was surreal,” she says. “We’d won best bookshop in Wales, yet I wasn’t sure for how much longer I’d have a shop that people could visit. It was like that scene in <em>Star Wars</em> when the walls are moving in, and the room’s getting smaller and smaller. The goalposts were shifting every day. At first, we thought: OK, we’ll buy hand sanitiser! But by the weekend, it was clear the shop would have to close.” Her first thought was for her staff, who are “like family” to her; the government’s subsequent announcement of its <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/03/furloughed-from-work-it-pays-to-know-your-rights">furlough scheme</a> came as a huge relief. But there was also the question of her stock, and how she might keep selling it. Suddenly, the Book-ish website, hitherto used only to sell event tickets and signed copies, came into its own: “On the Saturday before lockdown began, we managed to get all 6,000 titles from the shop on to our website.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/10/could-lockdown-herald-an-exciting-new-chapter-for-the-book-trade">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Victor Grayson was briefly the most famous socialist in Edwardian England. But in 1920 he disappeared. His fate remains one of the most compelling mysteries in British political history</p><p>“<em>Oh mad, foolish Grayson!</em>”<br /><em>Editorial in the socialist magazine </em><em>The Clarion</em><em>, August 1907</em></p><p>In the aftermath of the general election of February 1974, the mood in Marsden socialist club in west Yorkshire was grim. David Clark, the young Labour MP for Colne Valley, in which the former mill town of Marsden sits, had lost his seat. Clark gamely attempted to lift his activists’ spirits with a rousing speech. But one elderly stalwart remained unmoved: “Old Harry was sitting at the bar nursing a pint,” recalls Clark, who is now 80 and a Labour peer. “He said: ‘All due respect to master Dave, but we’ve only ever had one true socialist MP around here. And that was Victor Grayson.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/10/a-century-on-whatever-happened-to-labours-firebrand-lost-leader">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Taking Britain safely out of lockdown will necessitate greater surveillance</p><p>A commonplace criticism of political parties is that they have drifted “into their comfort zone”, which mostly means that Labour talks a lot about raising spending, while the Conservatives talk about cutting taxes. But politicians have comfort zones that are operational as well as ideological: ways of working that they find more attractive than others.</p><p>In late 2014, one ambitious young shadow cabinet minister asked his aides to draw up a 14-point plan to help him become leader of the Labour party. Step two involved an itemised list of Labour MPs, each of whom, he was told, he needed to wine and dine if he was to have any hope of making a successful bid at the job. The frontbencher in question contemplated evening after evening spent in conversation with his colleagues versus time spent with his wife and children. Surely, he reasoned, he could achieve the same end by writing thoughtful columns in the newspapers and delivering wide-ranging speeches?

<p>The myth of the American west meets the energy of riot grrrl in Justine Kurland’s photographs of free-spirited teenage girls</p><p>In 1997, <a href="http://www.justinekurland.com/">Justine Kurland</a>, then a fine arts student at Yale University, went in search of teenage girls to photograph. At a time of increasing conformity and commercialised ideas of beauty, the girls she had in mind were free-spirited and wild-haired; making dens and hanging out in woods, messing about in rivers, smoking in parking lots, lost in languid afternoons, careless not only of the male gaze but any onlookers at all.</p><p>Kurland started out on her quest in New Haven’s semi-industrial hinterland before travelling further afield over the next five years on a mazy road trip; if the girls were on the margins, then she would be too. She loosely choreographed the groups of teenagers that she found, but mostly invited the girls into a promising setting and let them do their thing. She took this photograph of four girls in an abandoned car in the millennium year, and called it <em>Shipwrecked</em>. The girls she chose invariably understood the idea of the pictures. “I can always spot people,” she has said. “It’s, like, really one of my superpowers. I can always tell which teenage girls would love living in the woods with their friends.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/may/10/the-big-picture-americas-wild-young-women">Continue reading...</a>

Yet just the day before, most newspapers were emblazoned with <a href="https://www.thepaperboy.com/uk/2020/05/07/front-pages-archive.cfm">excited headlines </a>foretelling a significant relaxation of social distancing restrictions, based on briefing from government sources: “Lockdown freedom beckons”, “First steps to freedom from Monday” and “Stay home advice to be scrapped”.</p><p>Despite the critical importance of clear public messaging to any public health strategy, the government’s communications have been marred by mixed messages throughout this deadly pandemic. Its core message, asking the public to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives, has been very effective, but this has consistently been undermined by ministers and advisers inaccurately briefing the press that there is about to be a shift in policy. Before the Easter weekend, reports appeared that ministers thought that the public had been too obedient in following the lockdown, and that a relaxation was imminent. The same happened before this bank holiday weekend, forcing the government to clarify that there was no change in restrictions and that people must continue to abide by the law.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/10/the-observer-view-on-the-governments-lack-of-a-proper-lockdown-plan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The first rule is, don’t be a complete schmuck...</p><p>In the opening chapter of <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/wine-girl-9780349726274.html" title="">Wine Girl</a></em>, the hugely entertaining memoir by Victoria James, once America’s youngest sommelier, the author describes a blood-boiling encounter with the kind of customer for whom involuntary euthanasia should be devised. It is a Monday lunch at the glossy <a href="https://www.aureolenewyork.com/" title="">Aureole</a> in New York and the host of a testicle-heavy table of four has ordered a $650 bottle of a serious white burgundy (a 2009 Chevalier-Montrachet from Domaine Ramonet).</p><p>Having checked at her serving station that the wine isn’t tainted, James returns to the table and pours a small measure for the customer to taste. He declares it corked. “I think she has too much perfume in her nose, this girl…” he says, as if competing for a gold in the misogyny Olympics. There are only two bottles of the wine in the restaurant’s cellar. James does not want to waste a big-bucks bottle when she knows it is perfectly fine. Instead, she presents the unopened second bottle, takes it away, then returns and gets him to taste the original bottle again. And between racist epithets, he declares it perfect, with a fat top note of triumph in his voice.
