Full (?) OST for Top Gear 2 Amiga by Patrick Phelan (1994). This upload is intended for headphones only.

Jumplist:
00:00 "Night Train" (Title)
02:01 "Topracertitle" (Ingame 1 Auckland *)
05:10 "Top2" (Results/Champion)
05:56 "Burn Rubber" (Ingame 2 Ayers Rock)
07:51 "Destructive Comment" (Ingame 3 Canterbury Plains, AGA version **)

*) Looks like this track is missing from the AGA version.

**) In the AGA game, this is the first heard ingame music (Auckland). There were 2 different 'Destructive Comment' tracks available. The one tagged AGA is larger so probably has some higher quality samples (or samples that don't exist on the OCS version). For this reason i chose AGA version.

Made using real A1200 Rev. 1D.4 audio.
