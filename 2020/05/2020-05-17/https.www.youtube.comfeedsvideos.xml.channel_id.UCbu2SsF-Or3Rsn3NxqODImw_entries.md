Microsoft is set to go into the next console generation in Holiday 2020 with the release of Xbox Series X, the fourth generation of Xbox consoles. And with that generational change, Microsoft has the opportunity to fix a long-standing problem with its Xbox consoles: Achievements and Gamerscore.

In the video above, Jordan Ram√©e airs his grievances about Xbox Achievements, namely that Microsoft continues to allow developers and publishers to create ones with numeric values that aren't multiples of five. Unlocking these Achievements can lead to a Gamerscore becoming an imperfect prime number--an annoying stain to an Xbox account's reputation. 

It's not all doom and gloom though. Jordan makes sure to point out what he likes about Xbox Achievements too in hopes Microsoft continues those trends with the release of Xbox Series X. Tracking an Achievement's unlock rate is his favorite feature, as it gives him a sense of pride when he unlocks an Achievement that few others have, such as Titanfall 2's Every Nook and Cranny or Dark Souls III's The Dark Soul, and a sense of fascination to see where the majority of a playerbase fell off of a game.
