<p>German photographer and artist best known for her pictures of the Beatles, whose distinctive image she helped to shape</p><p> “Black and white means photography to me,” said Astrid Kirchherr in 1995. “It’s much easier to take a good colour photograph, but you can get more drama into a black and white one.” It was in black and white that Kirchherr, who has died aged 81, captured the unknown Beatles in 1960, shooting them in leather jackets against industrial Hamburg and helping to form their distinctive image.</p><p>It was her mastery of light and shade in her <a href="https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp84332/astrid-kirchherr">1962 portraits of John Lennon and George Harriso</a>n that influenced the cover of the 1963 album With the Beatles. However her influence went further than photography. It was Kirchherr who brushed out the flat-top hairstyle sported by her then Beatle boyfriend Stuart Sutcliffe, which led to the rest of the band adopting the famed “moptop” look.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/17/astrid-kirchherr-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

The aim of providing a route out of lockdown was a reasonable one. But the strategy and execution were badly mishandled and confused. The botched broadcast fractured a valuable existing consensus. At a stroke, a unified UK-wide approach was cast aside. A week ago, Mr Johnson became in effect the leader not of the United Kingdom but of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/13/boris-johnson-prime-minister-england-coronavirus" title="">England alone</a>.</p><p>Mr Johnson’s announcements were not followed by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations. Instead they chose to stick to the lockdown. This division among the partner nations was avoidable. It is also unhelpful to their citizens as a whole. The error was Mr Johnson’s. He needs to focus urgently on restoring a common approach across the four nations that avoids what the Greater Manchester mayor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/are-we-all-in-this-together-it-doesnt-look-like-it-from-the-regions" title="">Andy Burnham</a>, has called a London-centric approach.

<p>Financial imperatives should not override safety concerns in resuming the interrupted football season</p><p>At the end of March, a poll found that in societies locked down to combat Covid-19, <a href="https://www.sportspromedia.com/news/gen-z-millennial-digital-live-sport-coronavirus-pandemic-study" title="">almost 40% of young men</a> said they felt the absence of live sport more keenly than any other deprivation, including going outside. Those pining for some action received their first proper fix for two months on Saturday, as the German equivalent of the Premier League reopened behind closed doors.</p><p>The Bundesliga is the first major football league to try to resume the interrupted season. In France, it was decided to curtail championships and award trophies on the basis of matches already played. In the Netherlands, the season was simply voided. The unfortunate players and supporters of SC Cambuur, who were 11 points clear at the top of the second division, are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/27/cambuur-captain-im-still-angry-its-an-unbelievable-decision" title="">understandably miffed</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/the-guardian-view-on-a-premier-league-restart-dont-force-the-pace">Continue reading...</a>

But while past waves of self-help and mutual aid led to the formation of large-scale co-operative and mutual enterprises, with 1 billion members worldwide, the obstacles to people moving from informal mutuality to a formal mutual body are now considerable.</p><p>The earliest mutual aid bodies, from burial societies in Rome to cow societies in England, were formed around common needs such as insurance, housing or credit. Today these tend to be regulated sectors with rules, such as initial capital requirements, that only work for new ventures if they are investor-owned.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/building-a-better-world-through-mutual-aid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Romantic and family ties are facing new kinds of challenges. Maybe there’s something the state can do</p><p>The 75th anniversary celebrations of VE Day may have been more muted than planned, but they still had the ingredients of a national pick-me-up. It remains striking how little the annual commemorations make space for reflection on the reality of living through war and the years that followed. Speak to those affected, and individual memories are far more complex than the national story of years of hardship followed by the sweetness of it all being over.</p><p>So many of the parallels drawn between war and pandemic have come in the form of cheap battle metaphors, which have little to add. But a better understanding of the way in which the social earthquake of war, experienced collectively by a generation, profoundly affects family relationships over the long term, might offer something.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/lockdown-straining-relationships-help-romantic-family-state">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Is the Premier League vital when grassroots organisations, lower-league clubs and the women’s game are under threat?</p><p>Another week, another Zoom. On the morning after the 2019-20 Premier League was supposed to finish, its 20 clubs will once again gather in their virtual conference room to decide how it will actually finish. There, emboldened by the successful resumption of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/16/germany-borussia-dortmund-schalke">Bundesliga over the weekend</a>, they will vote on the league’s protocols for returning to training, before debating how they will play the season’s 92 remaining fixtures, and what should happen if they cannot.</p><p>If the first part should be simple enough – the clubs are overwhelmingly expected to vote through the new medical protocols, allowing players to return to formal training by Tuesday morning – then what follows promises to be a good deal more contentious. A potential restart date will be mooted, with 19 June seeming to be the frontrunner at present. At which point, the same people who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/20/arsene-wenger-offside-plans-sensible-var-armpit-remote-refereeing">brought us the VAR armpit debacle</a> will try to convince us, with an entirely straight face, that they can run an impenetrable bio-secure league in the midst of a global pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/17/its-offensive-for-big-clubs-to-suggest-theyre-at-financial-risk">Continue reading...</a>

Powerful vocalist, frontman and songwriter with the Pretty Things, the outlandish rock band that inspired Bowie and Nirvana<p>As the singer and chief songwriter of the Pretty Things, Phil May, who has died aged 75 from complications following hip surgery after a cycling accident, achieved a status in pop history out of all proportion to his group’s record sales. The Pretty Things were outlandish and endlessly inventive, and inspired any number of punk, indie and glam-rock bands.</p><p>Their admirers have included <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/25/we-were-reprobates-the-pretty-things-on-being-loved-by-bowie-and-smoking-a-spliff-with-norman-wisdom" title="">David Bowie</a>, David Gilmour, Jimmy Page, the Sex Pistols, Iggy Pop and Nirvana, while their 1966 single <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3qJ-KPlt4M" title="">Midnight to Six Man</a> supplied the opening line of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96UtZPLiT90" title="">the Clash’s (White Man) in Hammersmith Palais</a>.

## Don Vappie & Jazz Créole: The Blue Book of Storyville review – delicate rhythm and banjo

<p>(Lejazzetal)<br />The New Orleans banjo maestro goes back to his roots</p><p> An easy-going singer, virtuoso of the banjo and larger-than-life character, <a href="https://lejazzetal.com/don-vappie-jazz-creole/">Don Vappie</a> is as New Orleans as they come. His mixed-race Creole ancestors were living in the city before Napoleon sold it to the US in 1803. A century later, Creoles, still speaking their own version of French, accounted for many of the city’s early jazz musicians, and Vappie (originally Vapaille) is making sure nobody forgets any of it. Not that they’d want to after experiencing this lively collection of traditional Creole songs, old jazz standards and Vappie originals.</p><p>To begin with there’s that inimitable New Orleans rhythm. It’s not always the same pattern, but it has what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/03/jazz.johnfordham">Jelly Roll Morton</a> (another Creole) called the “Spanish tinge”. With no percussion, there’s a delicacy about it here too. There are just three in the accompanying band: Dave Kelbie (guitar), Sébastien Girardot (bass) and David Horniblow (clarinet), whose bright tone and fluid style make him a perfect partner for Vappie. Their duet playing in the instrumental numbers, such as <a href="https://soundcloud.com/lejazzetal-records/couleur-de-creole?in=lejazzetal-records/sets/the-blue-book-of-storyville-by-don-vappie-jazz-creole">Couleur de Cr</a><a href="https://soundcloud.com/lejazzetal-records/couleur-de-creole?in=lejazzetal-records/sets/the-blue-book-of-storyville-by-don-vappie-jazz-creole">eole</a>, is simply brilliant. And it’s about time someone showed the jazz world what the banjo really can do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/17/don-vappie-jazz-creole-the-blue-book-of-storyville-review-delicate-rhythm-and-banjo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cooking and clearing up has been relentless – and that’s without adding a special birthday cake to my range of signature dishes<br /></p><p>I’m sitting down to write this having just cleaned fox poo out of the tiny grooves in the soles<strong> </strong>of my four-year-old’s sandals.

But for many parents – at which point I insert an enormous caveat to make it clear that I’m talking about those who haven’t been infected, or made redundant, and aren’t frontline workers, and are extremely lucky enough to still be operating in a strange bubble of “normal”<strong> </strong>–<strong> </strong>I’d suspect that the greatest challenges of the past few weeks, and moments of profoundest despair, have come in the kitchen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/17/family-cooking-under-coronavirus-ive-become-a-chef-with-two-grumpy-regular-customers">Continue reading...</a>

We step inside the yurt-inspired hub that’s fixing their culture shock</p><p>Visit Ulaanbaatar on Google Earth – the only way most of us are likely to get there for some time – and you will find that the Mongolian capital looks like no other city. Scattered around the Soviet-era urban centre are hundreds of thousands of tiny white dots. It is as if someone has emptied an enormous bag of confetti across the landscape, the white specks clustering in the folds of the valleys, extending outwards for miles in long, snaking tendrils.</p><p>These dots – separated in their own plot and sometimes accompanied by the orange rectangle of a tin-roofed shack, visible when you zoom in close – are yurts (or <em><a href="http://www.mongoliagercamps.net/home/pages/about_mongolia_ger">gers</a></em> in Mongolian). For thousands of years, these transportable tents, made of wooden latticework wrapped with insulating felt and canvas, have been the house type of choice for the Mongolian herders on the plains.

<p>Demand has rocketed as people consider how to get into work after lockdown. They enable riders to avoid car use and the close contact of public transport – but just how safe, affordable and healthy are they?</p><p>When Ben Longdon’s son got too heavy for him and his wife, Laura, to manage on the back of their bikes on their hilly Cornish commute, it looked as if they might have to start using their car. Instead, they hit on another solution – an e-bike. In non-lockdown times, Ben and Laura work at the University of Exeter campus about three-and-a-half miles from their home in Falmouth, and their children – they now have another son – attend the on-site nursery.</p><p>Most days, the family commute together. Ben rides a conventional bike, with Laura on the e-bike, pulling a trailer in which the two boys sit. “I can just about keep up on the flat if there’s not a headwind,” he says. “But she beats me up the hills. She can beat people wearing Lycra up the hills, even with the kids on the back. She normally waits by the entrance to the campus so I can have a drink of water and catch my breath.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/17/i-can-just-glide-through-traffic-how-e-bikes-could-answer-our-commuting-problems">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s now clear that drastic changes are needed: the Labour party cannot afford to play it safe</p><p>About a month ago, many people I know on the political left were brimming with the belief that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19 crisis</a> opened the way for a watershed conversation about deep social change. Now, as the full horror of the UK’s coronavirus experience becomes clearer and we begin to understand an all-enveloping crisis whose effects will be felt for years, that mood seems to have been supplanted by a pained mixture of anxiety and fatalism. On a bad day, our national nightmare now appears so deep and complex as to feel not just depressing, but insurmountable.</p><p>But from a somewhat unlikely source, there was recently a note of hope. Around the time of the recent VE Day celebrations, the journalist and historian Max Hastings – something of a freethinker, but also someone with a classic establishment background – wrote a piece for <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-joy-of-ve-day-masked-a-hunger-for-change-xhkxvlrpx">the Times</a>. His jumping-off point was the social revolution that began in 1945, but he quickly moved his focus to 2020. “The present crisis seems destined again to change the face of Britain, unleashing demands for social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories,” said this <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jun/24/boris-johnson-prime-minister-tory-party-britain">one-time editor</a> of the Daily Telegraph.

While he was there he took up track and field, and set world records over 100 yards, 220 yards and the low hurdles. He also played American football as wide receiver, and did it so well that the Detroit Lions drafted him after he graduated.

## We're all keen to show we care, but we've shaped a society that doesn’t care at all | Sam Byers

Superficially at least, we seem to have taken his admonition to heart – particularly now, as the Covid-19 pandemic forces us to find new ways of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/26/clap-for-carers-applauding-the-nhs-during-coronavirus-in-pictures">balancing isolation with solidarity</a>. For perhaps the only time in our lives, we can mobilise and participate simply by remaining at home. The contribution of individual behavioural changes to the management of a global crisis – which ordinarily feels dispiritingly small – can now be graphed practically in real time. To isolate is, in a very real sense, to care.</p><p>The problem, though, is that we’ve been conditioned into publicly expressing our care. Coaxed through social media into a perpetual state of display, we seem<strong> </strong>to fear that silence and indifference are synonymous. The act of caring about something – a cause, a tragedy, a crisis – is intimately bound up with how we communicate that care. In isolation, no one can see our concern, and we can’t gauge the commitment of others. As a result, our faith in each other becomes fragile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/17/show-care-lockdown-clap-transgressors-rontline-workers-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

Apparently it’s already been filmed, and involves “boundary-pushing technology” (Zoom) as well as a lip-sync for the crown.

## Ming Smith: 'I've always had to break boundaries'

<p>Photographer Ming Smith has been making pioneering work since the 1970s. Finally she is receiving the acclaim she deserves</p><p>In 1978, when Ming Smith took her portfolio to an open call at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the receptionist presumed she was a courier. “When I returned to collect my work and the museum wanted to buy it, she treated me very differently,” she says. But when Smith heard MoMA’s offer for her work, she almost didn’t take it. “I thought I was going to be rich, but it didn’t even really cover my supplies.” A curator convinced her to leave two images with the museum for the weekend in the hope that she would change her mind. She did (her boyfriend convinced her to take the money) and Smith became the first African American female photographer in <a href="https://www.moma.org/artists/7906?=undefined&amp;page=&amp;direction=">MoMA’s collection</a>.</p><p>Smith has often been at the forefront of change. As a child in the 1950s, hers was one of the first black families to move into a white neighbourhood in Columbus, Ohio. In her 20s she moved to New York and befriended Grace Jones, who invited her to Studio 54 the first night she performed there in 1978. Smith was the first woman to join <a href="https://whitney.org/exhibitions/kamoinge-workshop">Kamoinge Workshop</a>, a pioneering group of black photographers who, she says, “introduced me to the idea of owning the images we saw of ourselves”. Now, in her “senior years” (she doesn’t share her age), Smith is one of a group of artists finally receiving recognition from an art world becoming more diverse in its representation. But Smith, by her own admission, is a loner and only now feels comfortable to use her voice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/17/ming-smith-ive-always-had-to-break-boundaries">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tasty, comforting, simple dishes that will fill you up and also use up odds and ends from the cupboard</p><p>There has been much rummaging in cupboards recently and, whilst I have come across a small cornucopia of seeds, nuts and dried fruit in tightly lidded storage jars, few have contained more than the end of a packet. I could have used them up in a seeded fruit cake, but what felt more useful right now was a recipe within reach of anyone, maybe someone who has never cooked before. A recipe that won’t mind if you mix and match the ingredients according to what’s left in the cupboard. Which is why I dug out Mum’s flapjack recipe, the first thing I ever cooked with her; a recipe that in addition to being up for a few additions from the store cupboard, carries with it the warm scent of butter and golden syrup and baking oats and tells you, almost more than any other, that everything is going to be all right.</p><p>I am currently grateful for recipes that are happy with a bit of give and take</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/17/nigel-slater-easy-recipes-chicken-leeks-and-lettuce-fruit-and-oat-flapjacks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With time on our hands, jigsaws are having their moment. But what’s the appeal? And why are they so hypnotic? Richard Godwin speaks to puzzlers, creators and scientists to see the bigger picture</p><p>The darkness was all-consuming as we reached the midpoint of our journey, blackness and confusion all around. It had already taken us two days to make it to the forest. At a certain point, we looked up and realised our child was no longer with us, lost amid the shimmering foliage. “Teddy, where are you?” my wife called. “Forget him, he was only slowing us down,” I murmured, perceiving the dim shape of a branch through the leaves.</p><p>But there is always a way through – if not the colour, then the shape will guide you. Backs aching, eyes narrowing, language stripped to pure function, we began to piece together the blackest sections of the puzzle. “This is a waste of life,” my wife eventually concluded and returned to her novel. The glory would be mine alone. By midnight on the eighth day, the 500-piece Super-3D holographic jigsaw of the Hogwarts Express was complete.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/may/17/picking-up-the-pieces-the-great-jigsaw-revival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author argues we should celebrate the positives of being alone - and that concerns about the effects of lockdown on mental health may be misplaced</p><p>Frankly, I am having rather a good lockdown. Partly this is because I live very rurally – Dumfries and Galloway, in south-west Scotland, has an exceptionally low population density (about 60 people per square mile compared to the UK average of 727). Social distancing is a great deal easier and less stressful where there are so many fewer people. In addition, almost everyone who lives up my single track road works in agriculture and is therefore an essential worker and not in lockdown. Life is pretty “normal” in a daily sense. And we have a strong sense of community cohesion and care. Within 24 hours of the lockdown our “resilience hub” had been established; because I am over 70 my shopping is done for me and delivered, my neighbours keep an eye out for me. I feel both safe and undisturbed.</p><p>Moreover, after about the dreariest, wettest three months I can remember, we have been enjoying an extraordinary and glorious spring. The absence of traffic, both on the roads and in the sky, mean not just a wonderful quiet peacefulness but also a massive improvement in air quality. This combination of sunshine, hush and low pollution has increased birdsong – the other day I actually found myself irritated by the incessant repetitious carry-on of a cuckoo – and very possibly both wild flowers and butterflies. In addition we have had a good lambing and there can be few hearts not cheered by the enchanting gambolling of new black-faced hill lambs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/17/sara-maitland-savour-solitude-it-is-not-the-same-as-loneliness">Continue reading...</a>

He has asked subscribers to tell him their jokes and recorded himself reacting to them.

It is the alias of Olajide Olatunji, a 26-year-old from Watford, who happens to be one of the most successful YouTubers in the history of YouTube – a product and exemplar of our very online culture. (Friends call him JJ.) More than 20m people subscribe to his main YouTube channel, which he registered in 2008, when he was 15 and still at school and uploading videos of himself playing Fifa. This was before most of us, least of all grown-ups, came to realise that recording yourself playing video games in your bedroom might actually turn out to be lucrative. “I have African parents,” Olatunji says. “They wanted me to be the kind of person who becomes a doctor.” When he was asked to leave school, at 16, acrimoniously (grades troubles), family relationships became strained, though his parents needn’t have worried. At the time of writing, Olatunji’s videos have been viewed more than 5 <em>billion </em>times. He has 5.7m followers on Twitter and an Instagram audience of 8m. Even his secondary YouTube channel has 10m subscribers. At a moment when numbers like these really seem to matter – culturally, financially, <em>anthropologically</em> – Olatunji is overloaded with them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/17/ksi-money-gravitates-towards-me">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Births, marriages and fleeting hopes in times of struggle catch the eye of Witold Krassowski</p><p><a href="http://www.witoldkrassowski.com/">Witold Krassowski</a> took this photograph of a bride and her bridesmaid at a wedding celebration in Bulgaria in 1991. In his new book, <em>Sackcloth and Ashes</em>, there is a companion picture to this one, which shows the same wedding party parading along a street in Fakulteta, the Roma ghetto in the capital, Sofia. In that picture, the bride picks her way through mud and rubbish, leading a raggedy line of revellers that includes a clarinettist and an accordion player. Here the instruments have been hung up on the shack behind, in a pause in the festivities.</p><p>Fakulteta is the kind of place Krassowski has been documenting for 30 years. Its 25,000 residents remain cut off from the Bulgarian capital, long denied water and sanitation, and with only off-grid electricity. Many residents are effectively forced to work recycling the industrial waste that is dumped in the area. Krassowski, who first took photographs of his native Poland at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, has subsequently travelled in places as distinct as Tanzania, Peru and Mongolia, but his photographs have a remarkable collective poignancy. He has often been drawn to the universal exclamation marks in human lives – births, marriages and deaths; and, as here, to little moments of reflection and hope in lives characterised by hardship and struggle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/may/17/the-big-picture-a-pause-during-celebrations-in-90s-bulgaria">Continue reading...</a>
