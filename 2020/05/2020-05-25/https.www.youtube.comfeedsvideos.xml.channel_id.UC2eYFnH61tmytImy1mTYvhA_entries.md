Some of the big advantages of dwmblocks is the ability to signal changes in modules, rather than rerunning scripts over and over again. My build is also clickable, left and middle clicks run commands, right click opens an informational message and shift clicks open the actual script to edit. All of the modules are scripts that can be easily customized and I've had them since my i3blocks build with many improvements.

Yes, if you're a normie, this is how you make your computer look "cool like the people in the movies!" 🤚😮🤚

This is my setup/build of dwm. I talk about some of the interesting things you can do with it, including multiple layouts in stacks, binding all the programs you like, vanity gaps, moving things around efficiently and automatically, floating windows, mouse binds, tags and workspaces and everything else.

You can download my entire system on an Arch-based distro by looking at https://larbs.xyz
