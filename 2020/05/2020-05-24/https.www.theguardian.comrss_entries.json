The UN leader\u2019s appeal received strong support from civil society groups, charities, churches and human rights organisations. In Colombia, the Philippines and South Sudan, armed groups initially heeded his call. But to their great shame, the US, China and Russia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/un-ceasefire-resolution-us-blocks-who\">blocked the plan </a>in the UN security council. They continue to do so.<br /></p><p>Those who suggest a global ceasefire would be a merely symbolic gesture should listen to the Norwegian Refugee Council. Since 23 March, when Guterres spoke, more than <a href=\"https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/may/armed-conflict-displaces-660000-since-un-call-for-global-ceasefire/\">660,000 people around</a> the world have been forced to flee their homes because of armed conflict, it reported last week. Failed ceasefires in Yemen, Libya and Afghanistan continue to take a dreadful daily toll of civilian lives.<br /><br />\u201cThis not only hurts those who are forced to flee. It seriously undermines joint efforts to combat the virus,\u201d said the NRC\u2019s chief, Jan Egeland. \u201cWhile people are being displaced and killed, powerful members of the UN security council <a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/report/world/un-security-council-fails-support-global-ceasefire-shows-no-response-covid-19\">squabble </a>like children in a sandbox. World leaders must unite in protecting all communities from Covid-19.\u201d<br /><br />Donald Trump\u2019s objections to a ceasefire resolution, repeatedly proposed and delayed in recent weeks, have nothing to do with war or virus-related suffering, to which he appears indifferent. Trump dislikes the fact that the latest draft refers, indirectly, to the World Health Organization \u2013 with which he is irrationally feuding as part of his China virus vendetta.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-observer-view-on-the-failure-to-secure-a-global-ceasefire-during-the-pandemic\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-observer-view-on-the-failure-to-secure-a-global-ceasefire-during-the-pandemic", "date_published": "2020-05-24 05:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "With restaurants still shut, it's time to order a takeaway", "description": "<p>There\u2019s a wide variety available, from literally gilded to cheap and cheerful</p><p>In the depths of lockdown, the arrival of a takeaway can feel like a promising message from a lost world; one where restaurants continue to do what they always did.
