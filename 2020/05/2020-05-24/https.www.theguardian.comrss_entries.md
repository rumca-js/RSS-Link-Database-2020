<p>PM didn’t throw a protective ring around care homes, but he sure as hell threw one around Classic Dom</p><p>Look on the bright side: at least we’ve had it confirmed who is actually running the country these days. And it isn’t the prime minister. Boris Johnson is no more than Dominic Cummings’s sock-puppet. A fairly shabby one at that. The reality is that without Classic Dom, there could be no Boris. All that Boris really amounts to is a parasitical ball of compromised ambition fuelled by a viral overload of neediness and cowardice. There is no substance or dignity left within the prime minister. His only instinct is his own survival.</p><p>The equation was quite simple. If Dom was to be fired, then Boris would have to fire himself, because it is inconceivable that the ersatz prime minister didn’t know the de facto prime minister had broken the lockdown rules by doing a runner to Durham. But just in case Boris had been in any doubt, Dom had arrived at Downing Street four hours before the daily coronavirus press conference to remind him who was boss. There were to be no sackings and no resignations. Not yet anyway. There may be in the days to come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/no-dignity-no-future-boris-forsakes-leadership-to-protect-cummings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson’s absurd defence of his adviser shows his contempt for the public<br /></p><p>Ever get the feeling you’ve been cheated? Boris Johnson has previously lauded the effort and sacrifice of the British people, who for nine weeks of lockdown have endured not only inconvenience and discomfort, but hardship and in many cases real sacrifice: of desperately needed income, of the opportunity to support struggling relatives, see dying family members, or attend the funerals of loved ones. Now it emerges that the rules are optional for the prime minister’s friends. The stated message was: “Stay at home”. The unstated: “Do as we say, and not as we do”.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-durham-trip-coronavirus-lockdown" title="">breach of rules</a> by Mr Johnson’s adviser Dominic Cummings, revealed by the Guardian and the Mirror, is not an abstruse Westminster affair involving complicated financial dealings, or arcane parliamentary regulations. It is a matter that everyone understands and in which everyone has a stake, because everyone has given up something they valued and many have paid dearly. People feel not just indignation, but rage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-guardian-view-on-dominic-cummings-the-unaccountable-elite">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Authority faces £49m shortfall as airport revenue slumps during coronavirus lockdown<br /></p><p>Luton borough council is drawing up drastic cuts to services to avoid bankruptcy after after a coronavirus-related collapse in passenger numbers at Luton airport blew an estimated £49m hole in its budget.</p><p>The council described the impact of the projected drop in revenue from the airport as a “nightmare scenario”.

## By backing Cummings, Johnson has laid bare his disdain for the British public  | Martin Kettle

<p>The prime minister’s self-centred endorsement of his overmighty adviser is an outrageous snub to the rest of us</p><p>The shadow of death still hangs over the country. The losses from the Covid-19 virus continue to mount. The end is not yet in sight. The way we live will be altered by the pandemic and its consequences for years to come. Amid the weight and seriousness of life-changing and life-ending events, how can the national conversation be dominated for three days by the bad behaviour of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/24/dominic-cummings-must-resign-says-tory-mp-steve-baker">Dominic Cummings</a> during the lockdown?</p><p>The answer is brutal but clear. It is because Cummings has so much power and has done so much to make this country what it is today, first because of Brexit, and now because of the mishandling of the pandemic. The furore over his rule-breaking cannot be dismissed as a bubble issue, especially after Boris Johnson backed him so comprehensively and divisively from the No 10 lectern today. Now, whether Cummings ultimately goes or stays, this is a choice that affects everyone and everything.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/dominic-cummings-elitism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The French-American-Canadian who won at Roland Garros 20 years ago could turn opponents into spectators, but despite her talent it was a pushy parent that often stole the show</p><p>Twenty years ago, Mary Pierce was being dragged across the court. As she chased Monica Seles’s blows from side-to-side during their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vlJQDgt3xY" title="">2000 French Open quarter-final match</a>, one vicious drive volley flew straight towards her. Pierce instinctively leaped into the air and connected with the ball between her legs, which lobbed high over Seles’s head and landed perfectly inside the court. The shot has been replayed millions of times.</p><p>For most players, Pierce’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAZaHJsPIVI#=1m01s" title="">famous tweener</a> would have been a great omen of things to come. But tennis fans had spent a decade as attuned to Pierce’s demeanour as the actual strokes. The question was always, after all she had been through, if she was relaxed and loose enough to ever fly. As the crowd roa red, the answer came: Pierce sprinted the width of the court in glee and a smile glossed her face. A few days later she had beaten the world No 3, Seles, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/story/0,3604,330007,00.html" title="">No 1, Martina Hingis</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cWOhaB_8Fg" title="">Conchita Martínez, the No 5, </a>and become the first French singles champion at Roland Garros since 1983.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/24/mary-pierce-three-passports-two-grand-slams-one-overbearing-father">Continue reading...</a>

## In the fight against coronavirus, there can't be one rule for people like Dominic Cummings, and another for everyone else | Devi Sridhar

<p>The very message that was at the core of the government’s plan to suppress Covid-19 – stay at home – has been undermined</p><p>The lockdown was a nationwide policy: everyone was expected to follow the same rules. It has nevertheless exposed some stark inequalities. Elites have been able to endure the period in comfort, often in remote, spacious holiday homes. Those with office jobs have found themselves stuck in their flats, juggling restless children and Zoom meetings. And at the lower end of the income scale, there are people still showing up for their essential jobs as cleaners, delivery drivers and nurses, with scant childcare support and constant worry about exposure to the virus.</p><p>These are tense times, with millions of us making sacrifices, some large, some small. Whether’s it’s cobbling together a home-schooling programme while ill yourself, being deprived of the support of extended family or missing a loved one’s funeral, the toll has been significant. It’s no surprise then, that news the prime minister’s chief adviser travelled from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-and-lockdown-a-timeline">London to Durham</a> with his family while lockdown measures were in place has set off a wave of fury. While the British people have been remarkably forgiving of special privileges for senior members of the government – such as access to priority testing and tracing for themselves and their families, and early medical support upon diagnosis – extending this to an exemption from lockdown rules feels like a step too far.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/dominic-cummings-coronavirus-covid-19-stay-at-home">Continue reading...</a>

In reunion episodes, we get to hear from all the past contestants, with their thoughts on the trials and tribulations of the season. It’s one for the hardcore fans, for sure.</p><p>This one could make for a challenging watch (not to mention, a challenging recap) because it’s all been done virtually, for obvious, world-changing reasons.

<p>This multi-skilled explorer may well have been first to the North Pole – in 1909. What’s not in doubt is his resourcefulness and love of the Inuit</p><p><strong>Passport details<br /></strong>Matthew Alexander Henson, perhaps the first person to the North Pole. Born Charles County, Maryland, US, 8 August 1866.</p><p><strong>Claim to fame<br /></strong>Matthew Henson, the descendant of slaves, has a plausible claim to being the first explorer to reach the North Pole. He grew up in Washington DC and Baltimore, was orphaned and left school at 12 to be a cabin boy. When he was 22, a chance encounter with naval engineer Robert Peary resulted in a lifelong working relationship, including 18 years of Arctic exploration. On 6 April 1909, Henson, Peary and four Inuit drove their dogsleds to the North Pole – or as near as makes no difference. Peary took the credit for being first, but a newspaper article on their return quoted Henson as saying he’d been part of a leading group that had overshot the pole by several miles: “We went back then and I could see my footprints were the first at the spot.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/may/24/matthew-henson-arctic-explorer-first-man-to-north-pole">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shopping has taken us in some mighty strange directions since the virus arrived</p><p>So perhaps, if we stay alert and follow Mr Johnson’s absolutely infallible multicoloured plan, the shops will open soon. I don’t know how I feel about that. On the one hand, I have missed ferreting through the TK Maxx beauty aisle, sorting the brand-name wheat from the quixotically named chaff (so many unlikely doctors selling moisturiser!) then entering a fugue state and emerging with a yoga block, some bath salts and four bags of nearly expired cantucci biscuits. On the other, it’s been interesting to experiment with consuming differently, and less.</p><p>Of course, it’s only “interesting” when you’re not hungry, skint, sick or scared. But there’s a salutary jolt to the system in not buying things you don’t need, having to wait, and wait, for a pair of scissors, or being thrilled by a bag of penne. Since the panic buying subsided, I’ve shopped in the ways I always knew I should: making careful lists, planning meals and staying local. Some intriguing alternative networks have sprung up around food, in particular, mixing old and new. A tip from an acquaintance about a wholesaler selling online transformed my stepfather into the yeast king of his street, doling it out to all comers. A weekly email sends me to a car park where a man in a van hands over foraged greens, local eggs and rhubarb on tick. A different man leaves an Eccles cake on your doorstep at 3pm if you DM him at 9.30am sharp. I’ve even heard of an invitation-only fish-buying collective (I’m not invited).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/24/emma-beddington-who-knew-a-massage-gun-would-be-a-lockdown-essential">Continue reading...</a>

<p>During the decade our writer lived in BA, he got to grips with its streets through the verse of Jorge Luis Borges – and is now revisiting the city via his poetry</p><p>Lockdown has made me nostalgic – not about travelling so much as about places. It’s no surprise the focus of some of my fondest remembering has been the world capital of looking back: Buenos Aires. The reasons behind this are many and complex. Porteños – BA residents – are famously given to looking far away, to the Spain or Italy of their ancestors, and to romanticising the brief belle époque of the early 20th century, when Argentina was rich and promising. Tango is laced with longing for the missed and elusive.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/05/lockdown-learning-how-to-dance-tango-classes-online-youtube">Bored in lockdown?

<p>German photographer Peter Bialobrzeski finds Britons clinging to their tribes in the post-Thatcher years<br /><br /></p><p>There is a probably apocryphal story of an <em>Observer</em> news journalist who, when asked to write an impressionistic feature story, was told to “make sure it has plenty of colour”. When the story came in, it was his standard news copy except that every noun had an accompanying adjective from a child’s crayon set: “blue sky”, “green trees”, “black tarmac”, “yellow sun”.</p><p>I was reminded of that story when looking through Peter Bialobrzeski’s pictures of the aftermath of Margaret Thatcher’s Britain, all taken in 1991 and 1992. If we were ever tempted to view those post-industrial years in political black and white, Biaolobrzeski’s pictures insist on colouring them in.

<p>In blocking the UN plan, the leaders of the US, China and Russia are responsible for more conflict and chaos</p><p>Two months have passed since António Guterres, the UN secretary-general, called on warring parties around the world to lay down their weapons and help fight another battle – against Covid-19. “The fury of the virus illustrates the folly of war,” Guterres said. “That is why I am calling for an immediate <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972">global ceasefire </a>… It is time to put armed conflict on lockdown.” <br /><br />This was and remains an entirely sensible idea. The UN leader’s appeal received strong support from civil society groups, charities, churches and human rights organisations. In Colombia, the Philippines and South Sudan, armed groups initially heeded his call. But to their great shame, the US, China and Russia <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/un-ceasefire-resolution-us-blocks-who">blocked the plan </a>in the UN security council. They continue to do so.<br /></p><p>Those who suggest a global ceasefire would be a merely symbolic gesture should listen to the Norwegian Refugee Council. Since 23 March, when Guterres spoke, more than <a href="https://www.nrc.no/news/2020/may/armed-conflict-displaces-660000-since-un-call-for-global-ceasefire/">660,000 people around</a> the world have been forced to flee their homes because of armed conflict, it reported last week. Failed ceasefires in Yemen, Libya and Afghanistan continue to take a dreadful daily toll of civilian lives.<br /><br />“This not only hurts those who are forced to flee. It seriously undermines joint efforts to combat the virus,” said the NRC’s chief, Jan Egeland. “While people are being displaced and killed, powerful members of the UN security council <a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/un-security-council-fails-support-global-ceasefire-shows-no-response-covid-19">squabble </a>like children in a sandbox. World leaders must unite in protecting all communities from Covid-19.”<br /><br />Donald Trump’s objections to a ceasefire resolution, repeatedly proposed and delayed in recent weeks, have nothing to do with war or virus-related suffering, to which he appears indifferent. Trump dislikes the fact that the latest draft refers, indirectly, to the World Health Organization – with which he is irrationally feuding as part of his China virus vendetta.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-observer-view-on-the-failure-to-secure-a-global-ceasefire-during-the-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>
