Yes, if you're a normie, this is how you make your computer look "cool like the people in the movies!" 🤚😮🤚

This is my setup/build of dwm. I talk about some of the interesting things you can do with it, including multiple layouts in stacks, binding all the programs you like, vanity gaps, moving things around efficiently and automatically, floating windows, mouse binds, tags and workspaces and everything else.

You can download my entire system on an Arch-based distro by looking at https://larbs.xyz
