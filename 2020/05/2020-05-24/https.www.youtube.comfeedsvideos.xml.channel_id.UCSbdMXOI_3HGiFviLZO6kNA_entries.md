Here are 3 ways (4 if you include RTX voice) to improve ANY VR headset's microphone quality. I will also go over fixing the robot voice that the Rift S does all the time. I also offer a microphone comparison between multiple VR headset mics and how they sound with Voicemeeter on and off. Spoilers, the valve index mic is incredible.
