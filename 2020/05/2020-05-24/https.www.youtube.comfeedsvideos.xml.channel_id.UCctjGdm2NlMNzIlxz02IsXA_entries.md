I don't say sorry very often, so naturally I was confused when several twitter critics implied that I didn't apologize hard enough on a Livestream I did with Vaush not too long ago. Let's take a look at some poorly thought out criticisms of yours truly and figure out why exactly I refuse to apologize. Normally I let these things go ... but I think we're all a tad bored lately.
