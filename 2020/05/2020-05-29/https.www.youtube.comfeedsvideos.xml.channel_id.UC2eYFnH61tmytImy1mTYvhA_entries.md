Classic video of me milking random statusbar modules I've written for educational notes about the Linux file system and the command line. I write a very terse module that checks your current cumulative network traffic (upload and download) and determines your download and upload rates per second or any time interval you give it. NO STUPID DEPENDENCIES!

Check out the script below. Tell me what obvious inefficiencies I missed.

You'll learn about RX/TX bytes, how to monitor network status, string operations on the command line, paste, and shell arithmetic. I go over some things quickly because there's a lot to talk about even in this minimalist script, but I might cover some of these topics in videos in the future because they're worth it.
