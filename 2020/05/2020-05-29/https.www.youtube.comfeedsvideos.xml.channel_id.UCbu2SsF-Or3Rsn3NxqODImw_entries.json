This week, Persia takes a look at six of her favorite in-game recreations.\n\nThese recreations run the gamut from video games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Pokemon Gold & Silver to anime like Spirited Away and live-action TV series like Parks and Rec. With a little imagination, the multitude of items, vegetation, landscaping tools, and furniture in New Horizons can be used to transform your island or home into a clever reference to your favorite location or setting from pop culture.\n\nAll of the recreations that Persia goes over aren't ranked--they're listed out in a random order. We here at GameSpot just want to celebrate some of the cool stuff that the community has created.\n\nIn GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review, Kallie Plagge writes, \"New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nZavJ's Spirited away Boiler Room: https://bit.ly/3ddhvHF\n\nruilarryliu's 2008 Olympic scroll: https://bit.ly/3cc5HnE\n\nOhSoPrecious16's Parks and Rec Scene: https://bit.ly/3gvymaH\n\nIggy524's Shibuya Crossing: https://bit.ly/3dcHSxo\n\nHyrule_game's Ocarina of Time Courtyard: https://bit.ly/3gGY7oC\n\nhinopika's Pokemon Gold and Silver island: https://bit.ly/36EZMqb\n\n#AnimalCrossingNewHorizons #ACNH #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NuVLxCBbB4", "date_published": "2020-05-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mortal Kombat 11 Aftermath Review", "description": "Shang Tsung steals the show in Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath's additional story content, but the expansion doesn't feel like an essential part of the already superb fighting game.\n\nEdmond Tran wishes Kano and Shang Tsung were his dads.

Persia goes over Boon's favorite feature for next-gen which is the slim-to-none loading times. Of course, great graphics are expected but Boon says load times are an underrated and door-opening part of next-gen gaming. \n\nPersia gives the PSA to Division 2 players as in-game audio files reveal spoilers for the Warlords of New York DLC. The in-game files are on the public test server and if you want to avoid having the story and future manhunt targets spoiled, steer clear of these audio leaks. \n\nE3 might not be happening this year but we've got you covered.
