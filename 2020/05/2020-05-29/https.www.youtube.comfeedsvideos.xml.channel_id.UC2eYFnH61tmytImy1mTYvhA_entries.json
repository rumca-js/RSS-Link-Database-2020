I write a very terse module that checks your current cumulative network traffic (upload and download) and determines your download and upload rates per second or any time interval you give it. NO STUPID DEPENDENCIES!\n\nCheck out the script below. Tell me what obvious inefficiencies I missed.\n\nYou'll learn about RX/TX bytes, how to monitor network status, string operations on the command line, paste, and shell arithmetic. I go over some things quickly because there's a lot to talk about even in this minimalist script, but I might cover some of these topics in videos in the future because they're worth it.\n\nDONATE NOW: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\n\nHere's the Network Traffic module I wrote/mentioned: https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/blob/master/.local/bin/statusbar/nettraf", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5phSVBEHhQ", "date_published": "2020-05-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA", "title": "Vim Diesel's OFFICIAL Vimtutor Let's Play/Commentary!
