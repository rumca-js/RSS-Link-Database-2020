To celebrate 25,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel, I thought I'd do a giveaway. And what better prize than the BRAND NEW Raspberry Pi 4 8GB model B computer I just got in the mail today!

To enter, just donate to any open source project, contributor, or maintainer, and fill out the Google form linked above. See the form for all rules/instructions.

I won't link to my Patreon/GitHub sponsor URLs because I want you to go find another open source contributor and support *that* person today! Thanks for watching, see you soon!
