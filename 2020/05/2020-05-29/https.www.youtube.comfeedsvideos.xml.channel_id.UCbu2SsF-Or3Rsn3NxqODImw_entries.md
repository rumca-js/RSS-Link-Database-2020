We're back with another video that highlights amazing community creations in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. This week, Persia takes a look at six of her favorite in-game recreations.

These recreations run the gamut from video games like The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and Pokemon Gold & Silver to anime like Spirited Away and live-action TV series like Parks and Rec. With a little imagination, the multitude of items, vegetation, landscaping tools, and furniture in New Horizons can be used to transform your island or home into a clever reference to your favorite location or setting from pop culture.

All of the recreations that Persia goes over aren't ranked--they're listed out in a random order. We here at GameSpot just want to celebrate some of the cool stuff that the community has created.

In GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review, Kallie Plagge writes, "New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future."

Shang Tsung steals the show in Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath's additional story content, but the expansion doesn't feel like an essential part of the already superb fighting game.

Edmond Tran wishes Kano and Shang Tsung were his dads. He spent around 10 hours with Aftermath, completing the story and putting the new characters through their paces online. Code was provided by the publisher.

Jean-Luc and Ben are back to destroy Mortal Kombat 11's graphics with a special Aftermath expansion-themed episode of Potato Mode!

Mortal Kombat 11 has finally received its Aftermath expansion DLC, and brought tons of new content with it. New characters, stages, and story chapters to accompany brand new ways to bring the pain to anyone sitting on the opposite side of the screen as you. A nice surprise was also the return of friendships! Everyone’s favorite humor filled way to humiliate their opponent after defeat is well and alive in MK11! What better way to celebrate all of this new content? Why we are doing a special run-back episode of Potato Mode just to cover it all!

Potato mode is our premiere low graphic show where not only do we turn the graphics down all the way, but we take it just a little further. Textures, models, and more will be turned to mush as we fight and friend out way through each of the new stages and check out new fatalities and friendships for Robocop, Fujin, and Sheeva as well as many others. Whose insides will oddly look the most delicious in this second follow up episode of MK11 Potato mode?

## Xbox Series X Will Improve Your Old Games! | Save State

Persia talks about Xbox Series X and its backwards compatibility techniques to make old Xbox games look better. These techniques will also double frame rates and provide HDR support to game that didn't have them before. All backwards compatible games will also have Quick Resume support which will allow you to navigate between multiple xbox games and generations with ease. 

Mortal Kombat creator, Ed Boon, appeared in a livestream recently to discuss PS5 and Xbox Series X. Persia goes over Boon's favorite feature for next-gen which is the slim-to-none loading times. Of course, great graphics are expected but Boon says load times are an underrated and door-opening part of next-gen gaming. 

Persia gives the PSA to Division 2 players as in-game audio files reveal spoilers for the Warlords of New York DLC. The in-game files are on the public test server and if you want to avoid having the story and future manhunt targets spoiled, steer clear of these audio leaks. 

E3 might not be happening this year but we've got you covered. This summer GameSpot is going to be hosting Play For All, a multi-week event that is going to be the best place for you to get all the latest gaming news, features, interviews, and live streams.
