Pub beer gardens | Grace Dent", "description": "<p>\u2018The most useful thing Dominic Cummings could do for his country right now is to flout lockdown again, only this time do it in a pub\u2019</p><p>In case you\u2019ve not noticed, going out \u2013 the comeback \u2013&nbsp;has started. I have been out, and I\u2019m not sure I like it. The new world has lots of rules and they\u2019re largely opaque. And the dining out options are lousy. I began with a trip to a newly reopened fish and chip shop in Chingford, while resembling an extra from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/oct/30/television\">prison camp drama Tenko</a>, hair-styling, mascara and bra-wearing having fallen off my agenda several months ago. Nowadays, only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rita-ora\">Rita Ora</a> and women on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok\">TikTok</a> wear actual makeup. The rest of us have grown too accustomed to not caring. Pre-lockdown, I wore more makeup than your average rodeo clown; right now, bothering even to tweezer a division in my monobrow feels fancy.<br /><br />No one will see me in the chip shop, anyway. The rules \u2013&nbsp;because there are chip shop rules these days \u2013 say queuing in a confined space is forbidden. \u201cTwo people only permitted inside the shop,\u201d the sign said. Everyone found this confusing. Did that mean two people from one household? Or two strangers? Did it mean that, if two people were inside the shop, I could stand outside and shout my order? Everyone\u2019s confusion about the new rules made the woman serving us livid. Although I\u2019m not sure if she was mad about us breaking the rules or mad that the rules meant she had to wear a mask.<br /><br />Alas, those chips, which I\u2019d dreamed about and plotted over for more than 60 days, were lukewarm and soggy by the time I\u2019d driven them home. The rules strictly forbid leaning against the ledge eating them hot and fresh in the chip shop while helping yourself to extra salt and vinegar, which, now that I think about it, was one of life\u2019s sweetest, simplest pleasures. Yes, eating in a layby is, technically, permitted, but let\u2019s face it, I\u2019d look like a carb-loading dogger. I\u2019m trying hard to love life in the new world, but my feelings are presently tepid.<br /><br />Along with chip shops and takeaway coffee, we seem to have been given back the right to have picnics. This is great news for fans of eating Sainsbury\u2019s coleslaw somewhere that has no working toilet, throwing a scotch egg into a bush to re-route hornets, drinking too much warm ros\u00e9 with friends of friends you have never really liked, and inevitably stinging your va-jay-jay on nettles while weeing. It\u2019s a no from me, but many people are devotees. The rule seems to be that you can eat mini-quiches outdoors, but mind who you do it with. And do not, whatever you do, attempt to use a picnic bench in the park for your picnic, because they\u2019re all still taped up like crime scenes.</p><p>It could be time for us to question many of these things, and what we possibly need right now are more rule-breakers. The most useful thing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> could do for his country right now is to flout lockdown again, only this time do it in a pub beer garden. He needs to take one for the team. There are few sadder sights across the land than these much-loved but now abandoned sun traps, their tatty wooden benches baking indolently in the sun. All these unseasonably glorious May days have been going to waste, and for a man so fiercely Brexit, that is about as anti-British as it gets. I drove past a dozen pubs on my way home with my lukewarm chips, and my heart was colder still.<br /><br />Cummings\u2019 last jaunt made us question our pilfered right to wander in forests and even take a pleasant day trip to Barnard Castle, but we need him for a much bigger job. He should start this Saturday morning with a swift drink on the lovely sun terrace outside the <a href=\"https://www.the-albion.co.uk/\">The Albion in Islington</a>, before sinking four or so more \u2013 possibly with his top off \u2013 over lunchtime.<br /><br />Yes, the fallout would be incendiary, but once the quacking had stopped, something magical might happen. Perhaps we could prise these spaces open again. Although we\u2019re grateful for car showrooms and golf clubs, these things mean nothing to the majority.&nbsp;And, obviously, there would need to be some rules \u2013 most of us have proved we\u2019re good at following those \u2013 but there would also be cloudy cider with friends, giant Jenga, hot chips in a plastic basket, cheap ketchup in sachets, bad jokes and lots of sunburned forearms. Things will move on, but I know I will never take my right to loiter and languish, to laugh with friends or to drink lager from a pint glass for granted ever again.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/29/the-thing-i-miss-most-in-lockdown-now-pub-beer-gardensgrace-dent\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/29/the-thing-i-miss-most-in-lockdown-now-pub-beer-gardensgrace-dent", "date_published": "2020-05-29 09:00:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Britain's teacher heroes: the legends of lockdown lessons", "description": "<p>From a teacher who has created his own YouTube character to another who takes students on virtual walks, we profile some of your nominations </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>When they went into emergency lockdown two months ago, many thousands of teachers were forced to fall back on deeply unfamiliar practices: digital learning, lessons by Zoom and Teams, classes of remote, invisible pupils.</p><p>Now, ahead of a very gradual \u2013 and controversial \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/28/reopening-english-schools-on-monday-could-lead-to-new-surge\">back-to-school operation</a> starting Monday, an entire profession has received a glowing report card from parents full of admiration for the way teachers have taken to technology, creativity \u2013 and fancy dress \u2013 to keep their children keen.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/29/britain-teacher-heroes-educators-making-most-lockdown-lessons\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/29/britain-teacher-heroes-educators-making-most-lockdown-lessons", "date_published": "2020-05-29 08:51:58+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "B&M buoyed by DIY sales boom in UK coronavirus lockdown", "description": "<p>Retailer reports 23% surge in demand for gardening and home improvement items</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The discount retailer B&amp;M has said exceptionally strong demand for DIY and gardening products in the coronavirus lockdown drove a 22.7% jump in underlying UK sales over the last eight weeks.</p><p>The group, which has traded throughout, said UK like-for-like sales growth had accelerated from 6.6% in the final quarter of its 2019-20 year, which benefited from a strong grocery performance in March.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/29/b-and-m-diy-sales-uk-lockdown-home-improvement-gardening\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/29/b-and-m-diy-sales-uk-lockdown-home-improvement-gardening", "date_published": "2020-05-29 08:01:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'Free drinks, drugs, boys': what happens next for RuPaul's Drag Race winners", "description": "<p>Ahead of Friday night\u2019s season 12 finale, past victors including Jinkx Monsoon, Alaska and Sasha Velour look back at what the crown meant for them</p><p>An hour before the first episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season three aired on US cable network Logo TV, Raja turned up for her gig at Micky\u2019s, a popular gay bar in West Hollywood.

But when Covid-19 hit, his artworks began to feel eerily prescient</p><p>I was in Toronto for both waves of Sars in 2003. You didn\u2019t quibble with the disease. Globally, it killed one in 10 of its victims. Toronto had 44 deaths. The Toronto Sars experience was similar to, but different from, Covid. One huge difference is that in 2003, the internet and smartphones were still in semi-infancy. There was a crazy deadly virus out there and like now, people wore masks and stayed inside. But importantly, they weren\u2019t spending all their waking hours terrifying themselves with dire forecasts, quack statistical modelling, blatant misinformation and political toxic waste \u2013 and the Sars experience was clearly, distinctly, far less scary than Covid-19. There\u2019s a lesson there.</p><p>Eight years later in Vancouver \u2013 and this will ultimately connect up \u2013 I hosted a \u201cYouTube Night\u201d at a friend\u2019s nightclub. My MacBook Pro was linked to a jumbo screen, and guests shouted out directions for where to surf next. It was a terrible idea. Going online remains an entirely solitary activity and everyone that evening left feeling unsatisfied. The nightclub had asked me to do posters advertising the event. I liked that idea, but I wanted them to have huge words so that people could read them while driving by in their cars, so I used the nightclub\u2019s house font, a bold sans serif called Knockout, which had originated on boxing posters. I created 10 slogan-like statements that made sense in 2011, but which would have been meaningless to someone 20 years ago. We then pasted them on to construction hoardings around Vancouver. The most popular slogan remains: <strong>i miss my pre-internet brain</strong>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/29/i-miss-my-pre-internet-brain-slogans-coronavirus-douglas-coupland\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/29/i-miss-my-pre-internet-brain-slogans-coronavirus-douglas-coupland", "date_published": "2020-05-29 06:00:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The journey home after a perfect trip away is the best, bittersweetest bit | Hannah Jane Parkinson", "description": "<p>A lot of people love getting home and putting the kettle on.
