<p>F1 firm’s revenues slump but government refuses emergency £150m loan</p><p>When the government called for British industry to help build life-saving ventilators as the scale of the coronavirus crisis became clear, McLaren was one of the first to step forward. As part of the VentilatorChallengeUK consortium alongside Airbus and Rolls-Royce, by mid-April the Formula One firm was making components for the life-saving machines and building the trolleys used to transport them.</p><p>This week it has emerged that the high-tech business is involved in a different sort of emergency – attempting to shore up its own finances – and is trying to pledge its collection of hugely valuable cars and its state-of-the-art Norman Foster-designed HQ in Woking, Surrey, as collateral to get the finance it needs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/22/mclaren-pledges-luxury-cars-as-collateral-in-bid-to-secure-250m">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite some fine words about the environmental crisis, ministers are pushing ahead with a trade bill that threatens to damage the planet </p><p>The dust storms that devastated the US prairie during the Great Depression were the worst ecological disaster in American history. They were also, partly, <a href="https://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-the-dust-bowl" title="">manmade</a>. Decades of farming in the Great Plains had rid the topsoil of its native grass, leaving nothing to prevent fields crumbling to dust when drought struck in 1931. Across the Dust Bowl in midwest America, millions of acres of farmland were swept away in brown blizzards. Forced off the land, hungry families headed west in search of new jobs and lives. The dust blew so far east that it settled on the <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pt2WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184&amp;dq=dust+bowl+dust+white+house+lawn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H2Xbis2JJK&amp;sig=ACfU3U04oDfI8qk40riHrjvlOVjPyvorHA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjg07XjkcfpAhWko3EKHW8tAfsQ6AEwEnoECAoQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dust%20bowl%20dust%20white%20house%20lawn&amp;f=false" title="">White House lawn</a>.</p><p>Almost 90 years ago the US president’s response was not to lie about the scale of disaster or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-30000-americans-trump-blame-who" title="">blame others</a>. Instead, Franklin D Roosevelt launched one of his New Deal’s signature relief programmes: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/opinion/coronavirus-unemployment-youth.html" title="">the Civilian Conservation Corps</a>. Its mission was to put unemployed Americans to work. More than 3 million people planted 3bn trees, built shelter belts across the Great Plains to reduce the risk of dust storms, and created 700 state parks.

<p>The city is not the only place that should take heed of China reneging on its agreement</p><p>The end of one country, two systems is now clearly in sight. Though Beijing promised to respect Hong Kong’s freedoms and autonomy for a full half-century, it has chipped and then hacked away at them since the handover in 1997. Almost a year ago, the people of Hong Kong startled themselves and the world with their all-out rejection of the growing encroachments. About one in four took to the streets to protest against the extradition law.</p><p>Now, less than halfway through the 50-year pledge, China has taken a bulldozer to its foundations. The National People’s Congress is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/22/chinas-national-security-law-ban-subversion-and-separatism-hong-kong" title="">proposing</a> a national security law for Hong Kong prohibiting acts of “treason, secession, sedition, or subversion”.

It threatens to undermine all the cherished institutions and rights that distinguish this international city from mainland China. The legislation is designed to prevent “sedition, subversion, secession and treason”, but the manner in which it is being introduced is undercutting Hong Kong’s relative autonomy, its independent judiciary and its legislature.</p><p>The issue has always been controversial. In 1989, Beijing became worried by Hong Kong’s support for the pro-democracy movement in China; it requested that the territory draft anti-subversion laws on its own after 1997, when Hong Kong was handed over to China by Britain. Although this is required by article 23 of Hong Kong’s mini-constitution,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/hong-kongs-security-laws-what-are-they-and-why-are-they-so-controversial"> the Basic Law</a>, it has never been enacted.

<p>Recessions blight young people’s prospects for decades. We need New Deal-type policies now to help them</p><p>Youth unemployment and its scarring effects on the careers of young people were a major concern in the 2008-09 recession. Now that hopes for a “V-shaped recovery” from the Covid-19 pandemic are vanishing, the issue of scarring is again relevant.</p><p>Past research has shown that those who enter the labour market during a downturn carry the costs of doing so into middle age. These come in the form of lower wages and higher risk of unemployment. Whereas the work and pensions secretary, Thérèse Coffey, may claim it is “too early to set anything like that at all” (BBC Today Programme 19 May), the evidence is clear: recessions do lasting damage to young people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/22/we-must-act-now-to-shield-young-people-from-the-economic-scarring-of-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the amount of time I work has increased, my involvement has evaporated: is Fortnite and afterschool fun any substitute?</p><p>My wife received a text from a friend recently, asking her to thank me for something I had said about home schooling. My wife told me this, and followed up with the question: “What the hell do you know about home schooling?!” I decided to interpret her tone as playful rather than laced with rage, but she is absolutely right.</p><p>I have been spending an increasing amount of time working, which means my involvement in home schooling has evaporated. I am upstairs while the kids do home school with their mum, seeing me only when I pop downstairs to ask them to keep it down a bit, which I imagine makes my wife love me even more. In my defence, I only do this when I am recording voiceovers, a home setup that requires me to cover myself in a duvet to deaden any echo and use my phone as a torch inside my makeshift tent. (Remember that if you happen to watch anything with my voice on it during lockdown.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/22/while-my-wife-home-schools-ive-become-fun-dad-but-am-i-too-fun">Continue reading...</a>

## Why Sweden is unlikely to make a U-turn on its controversial Covid-19 strategy | Tae Hoon Kim

According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/20/sweden-becomes-country-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-per-capita/">coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world</a>, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK. But they are higher than those of Portugal and Greece, two countries with a similar size of population to Sweden. The <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/">figures</a> are also much higher than Sweden’s Nordic neighbours, with Denmark at 11,182 cases and 561 deaths, Norway at 8,309 and 235, and Finland at 6,537 and 306.</p><p>International observers and critics within Sweden blame these depressing figures on its controversial Covid-19 strategy. Unlike the rest of Europe, or what is often cited as the exemplar nation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/south-korea-beating-coronavirus-citizens-state-testing">South Korea</a>, Sweden has not imposed any lockdowns nor carried out mass testing.

## Wine: supermarket special offers aren't always what they're cracked up to be | Fiona Beckett on wine

<p>It has been called ‘one of the finest council estates in the country’. So why is Cressingham Gardens facing demolition? We report on the free book helping communities fight back</p><p>Nestled in the corner of Brockwell Park, <a href="https://c20society.org.uk/building-of-the-month/cressingham-gardens-estate-lambeth">Cressingham Gardens</a> housing estate feels like an extension of the rolling municipal greenery. The low-rise fingers of housing weave their way around clusters of mature trees, framing pedestrian paths flanked by lush patio gardens. Slightly higher blocks to the west mask noise from the main road, creating an oasis of calm where a village green faces a community hall rotunda, designed with “fairground overtones of merry-go-rounds and bandstands”, as a 1979 issue of the Architectural Review put it.<br /><br />Cressingham Gardens is, <a href="https://municipaldreams.wordpress.com/2014/09/09/cressingham-gardens-lambeth/">in the words of council housing expert John Boughton</a>, author of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/19/municipal-dreams-john-boughton-review">Municipal Dreams</a>, “one of the finest council estates in the country”. The London scheme was designed in the late 1960s by a team of Lambeth Council architects led by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/jan/24/guardianobituaries">Ted Hollamby</a>, a pioneer of high-density low-rise housing who championed a move away from tower blocks. </p><p>Hollamby wanted his developments “to create a sense of smallness inside the bigness” of the city, and to have “the kind of atmosphere in which people did not feel all herded together”. His philosophy is embodied in the layout of Cressingham Gardens, with its village scale and neighbourly feel, encouraged by front doors facing each other and ample space for children to play in the patchwork of lanes and wooded areas, a particular boon in these times of being trapped at home.<br /><br />Despite all this, Lambeth Council wants to knock the estate down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/22/a-kafkaesque-nightmare-the-survival-guide-helping-condemned-estates-beat-the-bulldozers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘The problem with eating in glass houses is other nitpicker diners throwing figurative stones’</p><p>We may be teetering towards a vague genre of semi-normal – some pubs are serving takeaway pints, Mr Whippy is being eaten in parks – but as we gain back some small freedoms, we won’t give up our new national hobby lightly. Many of us have learned the simple pleasure of spying. Actually, scratch that: spying, judging and sometimes even a little light dobbing. To the council, to the police or on social media. I’m as guilty as everyone else. I love being shown evidence of a rule-flouter, because it makes me feel ever so righteous and holy. But as I packed two plastic glasses this week and set off on foot to toast a friend’s birthday, I weighed up a new threat. I’d stay four metres away for the full duration, and we could even fit in some Zumba stretches, but that wasn’t what frightened me. It was more that if I went into the sunshine, I may be spotted by someone else in the sun who would get angry at me for taking a risk.<br /><br />This dual-think is increasingly common. The new patron saint of the national hobby, freshly canonised, is <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/family-dorset-beach-coronavirus-lockdown-complaints-a4444681.html">that amazing woman on Durdle Door beach </a><a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/family-dorset-beach-coronavirus-lockdown-complaints-a4444681.html">BBC News spoke to earlier this week</a>. Jane and her family had driven for an hour and a half to breathe some sea air and enjoy the feeling of sand on their toes. But when she got there, she found something quite harrowing: there were other families on the beach who were flouting the law. This summer, I reckon, all pub landlords, restaurateurs and shop owners will find their job specs stretched to include unofficial Covid-19 refereeing. Their work will involve one long, confused, tit-for-tat customer square-up. “I am drinking a quiet pint in the sun with my uncle to help with his lack of vitamin D,” some might say, but others will complain: “Those people across the beer garden are simply on the piss – you need to make them leave.” Or: “I am keeping the local economy thriving by using the local bakery, but these other people who queue up for pastries are idiots.”<br /><br />One way of reopening restaurants I saw in America involved guests sitting in small outdoor greenhouses, in tables of four and shielded from other diners. But the problem with eating in glass houses is the other nitpicker diners throwing figurative stones. “How can table three be sharing a bread basket? We overheard them say they’re not even in the same household!” Heaven knows what we will do with children eating out in the new world, not least as none of us can agree on their place in proceedings at the best of times. Perhaps we’ll return to the good old days of British childminding and leave them in the car with a packet of Salt’n’Shake and the window ajar. It was fine for me and the rest of Generation X. Absolutely no problems to see here.<br /><br />I saw something freshly peculiar by the see-saw in the local park this week. A gran, her son and a toddler, all drinking brought-from-home cups of tea in the sunshine. They also had a bag of brought-from-home sandwiches. It was a lesser-spotted, cross-generational grouping! They scoured my expression nervously and hid the flask from my sight in case I took some sort of issue or called an authority. This slightly paranoid feeling of watching and being watched is getting more normal by the day.</p><p>And as for some snooping friends, well, I didn’t know they had it in them. A woman I know in her mid-50s, famed for her lively parties where the guest list stretches to hundreds, took to social media last weekend to complain that some of her neighbours were having a barbecue. Should I call the police, she asked rhetorically. “It’s like they think lockdown is over!” she said, clearly upset and, yes, possibly within reason. “Definitely call them!” came the answer from many, including the kind of people who last year were being sick in her rhododendrons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/22/im-loving-the-new-national-hobby-of-spying-on-and-judging-each-other-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An estimated 1m businesses in the UK have been protected until October through the government’s job retention scheme. Here, Daniel Pillai, CEO of the Welsh solar roofing firm BIPVco, discusses how it has worked for him</p><p>Daniel Pillai first realised that life was about to change when he arrived at San Francisco airport on a business trip in February. Queuing at passport control, he noticed masked biosecurity staff checking the temperatures of incoming passengers. “I realised this thing [coronavirus] was about to hit us, and it was only a matter of time,” says the CEO and co-founder of BIPVco, a Welsh solar roofing company. “Our business had all sorts of contingency plans, everything from fire to worst-possible scenario. But a health pandemic? That wasn’t even on the radar, especially not for a company of our size.”</p><p>As at many small businesses across the UK, the Covid-19 pandemic forced BIPVco to reconfigure. The company had been manufacturing solar modules from its Newport factory since 2015, and currently employs 16 people. On 16 March, when the government advised that all non-essential businesses should cease activity to limit contagion, Pillai phoned his staff to tell them not to come to work the next day. At the same time, worries about his business started gnawing away. “We had many concerns: the welfare of our staff, letting customers down, plus the long-term viability of the business given that orders could disappear.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/22/i-call-furloughed-staff-once-a-week-how-one-company-is-coping-during-the-coronavirus-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the owner of East Lothian gastropub the Mercat Grill, Graham Blaikie has had to adapt his business to survive. Here, he tells Sophie Goddard how he’s keeping not only his pub afloat, but is helping out the people – and animals – around him, too ...</p><p>For thousands of small business owners, the global pandemic has flung their futures – and those of their staff – into uncertainty. That’s certainly true for Graham Blaikie, and his pub the Mercat Grill in Whitecraig, Scotland. “I’d been watching the news about Covid-19 since December and luckily we’d prepared,” he explains. “Even before we closed, we had contactless hand sanitisers and I was always wiping down handles and menus. I’d also removed items from tables, so there weren’t as many touch points.” But when Boris Johnson’s March announcement saw pubs and restaurants close to the public, the business that had taken Blaikie nine years to build was suddenly forced to adapt for survival.</p><p>The first step was ensuring customers could still enjoy the food they loved. “Prior to the shutdown, we’d been talking about what our strategy would be – I bought containers and had our takeaway menu prepped, so we were ahead of the game”, he says of being ready for business the next day. “We had a lot of fresh food in the pub, so on the Saturday we started the takeaway system.” But it wasn’t without its problems. “It’s not as easy as you think doing takeaway food, especially restaurant-style. When people order with us they’re having haggis cigars, patties, fish and chips, pepper beef with rice and my mum’s desserts ... that’s six different containers at least. We spent about £2,000 on takeaway boxes initially, that’s a lot of money. But it’s hopefully keeping us going.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/may/22/from-gourmet-takeaways-to-feeding-a-zoo-how-a-scottish-pub-adapted-to-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>
