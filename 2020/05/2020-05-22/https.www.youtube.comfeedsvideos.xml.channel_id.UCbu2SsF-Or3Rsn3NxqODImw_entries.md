With Ultra Instinct Goku now available in Dragon Ball FighterZ, we have all the pieces to recreate some of the most dramatic moments from Dragon Ball Super's Tournament of Power arc and Dragon Ball Super: Broly. When it comes to incredible moments in the Dragon Ball anime, very few come close to topping Goku vs. Kefla, Goku and Frieza vs. Jiren, and Goku vs. Broly.

In the video above, we recreate these memorable battles to the best of our ability. For instance, even though Goku goes Ultra Instinct in Dragon Ball Super to defeat Kefla in spectacular fashion, you actually need to use Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (or Super Saiyan Blue) Goku when fighting Kefla in Dragon Ball FighterZ in order to get the finisher that he uses in the anime. It still looks pretty badass though.

In GameSpot's Dragon Ball FighterZ review, Peter Brown wrote, "FighterZ is complex and distinct enough to be enjoyed by fighting game competitors, but there's no question that it's been designed to tap into the hearts of Dragon Ball's most dedicated fans, and no doubt those same qualities will win people over who've never given the series a chance. Where past games attempted to get there through huge character rosters and deliberately predictable trips down memory lane, FighterZ has bottled the essence of what makes the series' characters, animation, and sense of humor so beloved and reconfigured it into something new: a Dragon Ball fighting game that can go toe-to-toe with the best of the genre."

The latest dramatic finish added to Dragon Ball FighterZ recreates the fight between Ultra Instinct Goku and Kefla in the Tournament of Power arc of the Dragon Ball Super anime. While Ultra Instinct Goku has now been released as part of Pass 3, triggering this dramatic finish is actually performed with the Super Saiyan Blue version of Goku (SSGSS). Kefla, the first character of Pass 3, was announced alongside UI Goku and released earlier this year on February 28.

## Eating The Rich As A Shark in Maneater

A Grand Theft Auto Online Community Friday stream gone awry, Jean-Luc and Ben decide the best course of action to not only save the stream but also to vent their frustration over malfunctioning Rockstar servers is to become the sharks they knew they were always meant to be. 

Here is the trimmed version of the Community Fridays stream with over one hour of failed GTAO connecting removed. We are sorry for any awkward confusion this may have caused. Please enjoy us exacting revenge on a bunch of rich people who profited off of shark finning by plucking them right off of the golf courses they were looking to relax on.

## Fortnite - Tenet Trailer Revealed In Party Royale (Live Event)

Fortnite has held another live event that required players put their guns down and watch a video together. This time around it's just a simple trailer premiere--one for Christopher Nolan's upcoming film, Tenet. 

In the video above, David Ahmadi captures the new trailer, so if you happen to have missed the live premiere--either because you don't have Fortnite or you forgot to log-in or you just couldn't be bothered--then you can watch it here.

This is not the first time that Fortnite has been the center stage for showcasing a piece of media. An exclusive scene from Star Wars Episode IX: Rise of Skywalker premiered in Fortnite in December 2019 and both DJ Marshmello and Travis Scott have held concerts in Epic Games' battle royale. 

In GameSpot's Fortnite review, Michael Higham wrote: "While there are several moving parts in the game's ecosystem, Fortnite's biggest accomplishment is in how it seamlessly merges a number of simple mechanics to create a distinguishable battle royale game. What looks to be a straightforward building system steadily escalates to an elaborate display of tactical prowess. As the saying goes: It's easy to learn, hard to master. Although a few shortcomings in the map design eventually surface and fatigue in looting can set in, Fortnite rarely fails at challenging you in unexpected ways, resulting in something more than just another typical last-person-standing shooter."

Phil Hornshaw chomped, chewed, thrashed, and devoured sea life and uncautious humans for about 12 hours in Maneater on PS4, and wishes Chris Parnell could narrate everyday life, or at least additional shark-related life. Review code was provided by the publisher.

## Minecraft Dungeons Tier VI Redstone Mines Combat & Boss Gameplay

Minecraft Dungeons offers a new dungeon crawling-based interpretation of the block-building game. Though the basics of Minecraft still apply, you now need to reinterpret that Minecraft knowledge into how to build the ideal warrior or mage, forge a party of adventurers, and journey into monster-filled labyrinths in search of loot and bosses to defeat. 

In the video above, David Ahmadi fights one such boss. With his trusty bow and dagger in hand, the young rogue journeys into a Tier VI level dungeon, exploring the Redstone Mines until he encounters a blocky boss.

After a brief delay, Minecraft Dungeons is scheduled to release for Xbox One, PS4, PC, and Nintendo Switch on May 26. The game will be available through Xbox Game Pass on both Xbox One and PC day one, so if you're already a subscriber, you'll be able to go ahead and pick up Minecraft Dungeons "for free." 

Just because David goes it alone doesn't mean you have to. Minecraft Dungeons supports both local and online four-player co-op. It's drop-in and drop-out co-op too, so you can call up a friend while in the middle of a dungeon if you're having trouble.
