<p>The creator and star of Stath Lets Flats on the magic of David Earl’s YouTube creation, Steve Cumberland, and his pathos-tinged adventures</p><p>Lockdown seemed like the perfect time to watch loads and loads of stuff, but the more I watched, the more sort of sick I felt about myself. So, in the past few weeks I’ve watched less telly than I have done at any point in my adult life, just to ensure that I don’t become one with the couch, though I occasionally drift away from working to watch a web series on my laptop. My biggest binge is probably the same as it’s been for about 11 years, which is a series of YouTube videos starring a character that David Earl created called Steve Cumberland.<br /><br />David does standup as a character called Brian Gittins, but when vlogging first became a thing he started making the Cumbo videos too. He’s this perfectly flawed modern day character – essentially a very, very sweet loser who has convinced himself that life’s the party, and he’s the DJ. His delivery totally undermines everything he says; he can be telling the viewers that he had an incredible night out, but in reality, he probably sat in a car, waiting for some teenagers to come and smoke weed with him. When he laughs, he’s looking at you and praying deep down that you’re laughing too. There’s an upward lilt at the end of the laugh that says, “is that funny?! I really hope it is because if it’s not I have absolutely nothing!”<br /><br />Cumbo is relatively untapped, but for my money he stands alongside the character greats: your David Brents, Alan Partridges, Jill Tyrells. I get as excited about him releasing a video as I would a new episode of Human Remains. He can do anything and I find it funny. There’s a great four-episode miniseries on his channel, or you can just watch him playing the Sims. It’s all incredible. David’s performance throughout is untouchable. It’s such a brilliant and subtle observation of someone on the edge, without overdoing it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/07/for-me-cumbo-stands-alongside-alan-partridge-jamie-demetrious-lockdown-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coronavirus prompted an emergency operation to house rough sleepers in Travelodges and Holiday Inns. In many ways it has been a success – but what happens next?<br /></p><p> To begin with, Clare Sutcliffe found the shift from sleeping in a doorway in Soho to a king-size bed in a central-London hotel very disorientating. After 15 months sleeping rough, she found it hard to relax and really believe she was in a safe space.</p><p>“The first couple of nights, I couldn’t sleep with the light off,” she says. “This might sound mad, but I was a bit scared. It was different; when you’re used to sleeping out in the open outside and then all of a sudden you’re in a bed, in a room, with a door that shuts.” When she arrived at the hotel five weeks ago, she was a skeletal six-and-a-half stone; since then, with three meals delivered to her room every day, her health has begun to improve.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/07/i-might-have-died-if-hadnt-rescued-me-hotels-for-homeless">Continue reading...</a>

But what do they particularly love about writing for theatre?</p><p>A play in its conception is, for me, uniquely intimate and private. Eventually it grows to be the opposite of that and blossoms outwards, but there’s something about building it that initially feels delicate, fragile and personal.

<p>I found the story of Moomintroll waking up alone in a world transformed deeply unsettling as a child - and still do, writes historian Tom Holland<br /></p><p>When I was a young child and couldn’t get to sleep, I would dare myself to open my favourite book. Tove Jansson’s <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/moominland-midwinter-9781908745668.html">Moominland Midwinter</a> was not obviously frightening. It told the story of a large-snouted, gentle, lovable and wholly imaginary creature called Moomintroll, who lived with his bohemian family in a <em>gemütlich</em> house, in a beautiful valley, surrounded by friends. A hibernatory creature, like all Moomins, he normally had his adventures in summer. But in Moominland Midwinter, “something happened that had never happened before, not since the first Moomin took to his hibernating den. Moomintroll awoke and found that he couldn’t go back to sleep again.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/may/07/my-favourite-book-as-a-kid-moominland-midwinter-by-tove-jansson">Continue reading...</a>

## The Hundred Years' War on Palestine by Rashid Khalidi review – conquest and resistance

<p>A passionate history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ... does the political will exist to bring about meaningful dialogue?</p><p>Rashid Khalidi’s account of Jewish settlers’ conquest of Palestine is informed and passionate. It pulls no punches in its critique of Jewish-Israeli policies (policies that have had wholehearted US support after 1967), but it also lays out the failings of the Palestinian leadership. Khalidi participated in this history as an activist scion of a leading Palestinian family: in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and as part of the Palestinian negotiating team prior to the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. He slams Israel but his is also an elegy for the Palestinians, for their dispossession, for their failure to resist conquest. It is a relentless story of Jewish-Israeli bad faith, alongside one of Palestinian corruption and political short-sightedness.<br /><br />Khalidi sets out his stall early on: the Palestine-Israel war was never one between two national movements contesting equally over the same land but was always a “settler colonial conquest” by Europe-based Zionists whose founding father, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/05/antisemitic-attacks-hungary-israel">Theodor Herzl</a>, laid bare the project to Khalidi’s great-great-great uncle in 1899: Palestine’s indigenous population did not matter and would anyway benefit from the modernising effects of Jewish “pioneers”, such as America with its westward Manifest Destiny. For Khalidi, Jewish settlers, aided by Britain from 1917, and by the US later on, colonised Palestine, creating and securing Israel through six “wars”:<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/01/arthur-balfour-declaration-100-years-of-suffering-britain-palestine-israel"> the Balfour declaration</a> of 1917; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/27/guardian190-partition-palestine-alistair-cooke-1947">1947 UN partition plan</a>; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/26/israel-resolution-242">1967 UN security council resolution 242</a>; the 1982 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/jan/04/lebanon-israel-palestinians-thatcher-reagan">Israeli invasion of Lebanon</a>; the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine">1993 Oslo peace accords</a>; and Israeli leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/29/israel">Ariel Sharon’s Temple Mount visit </a>in 2000.<br /><br />Palestinian leaders from elite notables in the 1930s to<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/yasser-arafat"> Yasser Arafat and PLO-Fatah</a> in the 60s to Hamas never successfully channelled the people’s passion to resist. This is not to “blame the victim”. Khalidi points to the huge obstacles in the way: in Britain and later the US, Protestant Christians bought into this “colonial war” to “civilise” the native population. There is a useful tension here between colonial superstructure and the patriarchal hierarchy and cronyism underpinning Palestinian elite leadership. Jewish-Israeli perfidy is central to Khalidi’s study but bubbling up through the text are key moments of resistance that demanded the insurgent organisation and charisma of a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/24/archive-1922-death-michael-collins">Michael Collins</a>, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/10/india">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, or a Ho Chi Minh. This never happened. Instead, the well-organised Zionist movement (and Israel) instinctively divided disunited opposition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/07/the-hundred-years-war-on-palestine-by-rashid-khalidi-review-conquest-and-resistance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While Ken Livingstone got off to a good start, Boris Johnson was all show. And their towering ambition has scarred the city’s skyline</p><p>Twenty years ago this week, London began a journey into a political unknown. For the first time in history, its voters were asked to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/jun/27/londonpolitics">directly elect a mayor</a>. Their answer was a twist of irony. They voted for the same man who, 15 years earlier, Margaret Thatcher had sacked as London’s previous “indirect” leader, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/05/londonmayor.london2">Ken Livingstone</a>, the former head of the Greater London council.

In 1995 we persuaded Tony Blair, then in opposition, that it would be a suitably radical departure for his new government. He was hesitant, but saw the proposal as a way to circumvent his opponents among old Labour’s civic cliques. Despite the adamant opposition of his local government shadow, Frank Dobson, Blair put the idea into his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2000/may/08/londonmayor.uk">1997 manifesto</a> and, in 1999, into legislation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/twenty-years-on-mayor-london-livingstone-johnson-skyline">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My partner has moved out but my landlord insists I keep on paying the full rent although during lockdown I can’t move</p><p><strong>I shared a flat and rental payments with my partner until March when the relationship ended and he moved out. The fully paid-up tenancy lasts until mid June and the notice period is two months, so if I don’t want it to roll over, I need to give notice now. Due to social distancing rules, I don’t know if I’ll be able to move house in June, but equally I can’t afford to keep on paying the rent by myself. I have offered the landlord a reduced monthly rate between June and August, after which I will move out if lockdown is lifted. The landlord, a multi-national corporation, is adamant that I must pay the full market rate if I stay, even though they are unlikely to find a new tenant during the pandemic. I’m faced with the prospect of having to move out while being uncertain as to how I’m going to view, sign up to and move into somewhere new with the social distancing regulations in place.</strong></p><p><em><strong>MD, London</strong></em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/may/07/how-can-i-find-a-new-place-to-live-with-social-distancing-in-place">Continue reading...</a>

She transferred photographs of each one on to panels of felt before hanging them alongside such seemingly disconnected phrases as: “First impressions are the most lasting.” The wigs were a “surrogate”, she says, a way to explore “the person we see ourselves to be”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/07/lorna-simpson-there-are-days-when-i-cry-four-times-for-an-hour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We can expect psychological difficulties to follow as we come out of lockdown. But we have an opportunity to remake our relationship with our bodies, and the social body we belong to. By Susie Orbach</p><p>When lockdown started, I was confused by bodies on television. Why weren’t they socially distancing? Didn’t they know not to be so close? The injunction to be separate was unfamiliar and irregular, and for me, self-isolating alone, following this government directive was peculiar. It made watching dramas and programmes produced under normal filming conditions feel jarring.</p><p>Seven weeks in, the disjuncture has passed. I, like all of us, am accommodating to multiple corporeal realities: bodies alone, bodies distant, bodies in the park to be avoided, bodies of disobedient youths hanging out in groups, bodies in lines outside shops, bodies and voices flattened on screens and above all, bodies of dead health workers and carers. Black bodies, brown bodies. Working-class bodies. Bodies not normally praised, now being celebrated.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/07/patterns-of-pain-covid-19-psychotherapy-susie-orbach-bodies">Continue reading...</a>

My wife and I are fortunate to have jobs we can work remotely, though the collapse of barriers between work and home life is a frequent source of strife. Everything is compressed – time, space, interactions.</p><p>I have been photographing my family for as long as I can remember, but now it seems to carry a certain urgency. I’m watching my daughters grow older, taller, smarter. This would all occur normally, but our daily proximity makes it more apparent. I grow older, and more saddened by the weight of the world.
