Today, Persia highlights some stand-out moments from Inside Xbox. The highly anticipated Assassin's Creed Valhalla gameplay trailer was revealed but showed more environmental gameplay than combat. We'll have to wait a bit longer for more in-depth gameplay to be shown. We did learn that Valhalla will have Smart Delivery support alongside many other titles. 

Two new horror games were announced for the Xbox Series X. First is from Bloober Team, the developers behind Blair Witch and Observation are teaming up with Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka for a new horror game called The Medium. Second is Scorn, which is a metroidvania-inspired horror game with heavy art inspiration from H.R. Giger. 

Codemaster's rally racing game is back. Dirt 5 was announced and showed off many new elements to make every race unique, such as a day-night cycle and various weather patterns. 

Super Bowl Champion and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes made an appearance on stream today to talk about Madden 21, it's new "feel for the field" and its Smart Delivery Support.

The Call of Duty series has featured some iconic weapons through it’s lifetime, and players both old and new have their favourites and ones they consider the best. 

And while in 2020 new weapons are constantly being added through Call of Duty: Modern Warfare’s seasons, and patches, nerfs and buffs keep changing the stats of many of our favourite guns there will always be stand out greats in the arsenal of our favourite games.

From Modern Warfare 2’s ACR, to World at War’s MP40 and even the best of the bunch in the armour of Modern Warfare 2019, these are the best weapons (in Dave’s opinion) in the history of Call of Duty.
