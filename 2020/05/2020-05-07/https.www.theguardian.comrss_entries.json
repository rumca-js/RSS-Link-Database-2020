So, in the past few weeks I\u2019ve watched less telly than I have done at any point in my adult life, just to ensure that I don\u2019t become one with the couch, though I occasionally drift away from working to watch a web series on my laptop. My biggest binge is probably the same as it\u2019s been for about 11 years, which is a series of YouTube videos starring a character that David Earl created called Steve Cumberland.<br /><br />David does standup as a character called Brian Gittins, but when vlogging first became a thing he started making the Cumbo videos too. He\u2019s this perfectly flawed modern day character \u2013 essentially a very, very sweet loser who has convinced himself that life\u2019s the party, and he\u2019s the DJ. His delivery totally undermines everything he says; he can be telling the viewers that he had an incredible night out, but in reality, he probably sat in a car, waiting for some teenagers to come and smoke weed with him. When he laughs, he\u2019s looking at you and praying deep down that you\u2019re laughing too. There\u2019s an upward lilt at the end of the laugh that says, \u201cis that funny?! I really hope it is because if it\u2019s not I have absolutely nothing!\u201d<br /><br />Cumbo is relatively untapped, but for my money he stands alongside the character greats: your David Brents, Alan Partridges, Jill Tyrells. I get as excited about him releasing a video as I would a new episode of Human Remains. He can do anything and I find it funny. There\u2019s a great four-episode miniseries on his channel, or you can just watch him playing the Sims. It\u2019s all incredible. David\u2019s performance throughout is untouchable.

It pulls no punches in its critique of Jewish-Israeli policies (policies that have had wholehearted US support after 1967), but it also lays out the failings of the Palestinian leadership. Khalidi participated in this history as an activist scion of a leading Palestinian family: in Beirut during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon, and as part of the Palestinian negotiating team prior to the 1995 Israeli-Palestinian peace accords. He slams Israel but his is also an elegy for the Palestinians, for their dispossession, for their failure to resist conquest. It is a relentless story of Jewish-Israeli bad faith, alongside one of Palestinian corruption and political short-sightedness.<br /><br />Khalidi sets out his stall early on: the Palestine-Israel war was never one between two national movements contesting equally over the same land but was always a \u201csettler colonial conquest\u201d by Europe-based Zionists whose founding father, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/apr/05/antisemitic-attacks-hungary-israel\">Theodor Herzl</a>, laid bare the project to Khalidi\u2019s great-great-great uncle in 1899: Palestine\u2019s indigenous population did not matter and would anyway benefit from the modernising effects of Jewish \u201cpioneers\u201d, such as America with its westward Manifest Destiny. For Khalidi, Jewish settlers, aided by Britain from 1917, and by the US later on, colonised Palestine, creating and securing Israel through six \u201cwars\u201d:<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/01/arthur-balfour-declaration-100-years-of-suffering-britain-palestine-israel\"> the Balfour declaration</a> of 1917; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/27/guardian190-partition-palestine-alistair-cooke-1947\">1947 UN partition plan</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/26/israel-resolution-242\">1967 UN security council resolution 242</a>; the 1982 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/jan/04/lebanon-israel-palestinians-thatcher-reagan\">Israeli invasion of Lebanon</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/12/oslo-israel-reneged-colonial-palestine\">1993 Oslo peace accords</a>; and Israeli leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/29/israel\">Ariel Sharon\u2019s Temple Mount visit </a>in 2000.<br /><br />Palestinian leaders from elite notables in the 1930s to<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/yasser-arafat\"> Yasser Arafat and PLO-Fatah</a> in the 60s to Hamas never successfully channelled the people\u2019s passion to resist. This is not to \u201cblame the victim\u201d. Khalidi points to the huge obstacles in the way: in Britain and later the US, Protestant Christians bought into this \u201ccolonial war\u201d to \u201ccivilise\u201d the native population. There is a useful tension here between colonial superstructure and the patriarchal hierarchy and cronyism underpinning Palestinian elite leadership. Jewish-Israeli perfidy is central to Khalidi\u2019s study but bubbling up through the text are key moments of resistance that demanded the insurgent organisation and charisma of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/aug/24/archive-1922-death-michael-collins\">Michael Collins</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/aug/10/india\">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, or a Ho Chi Minh.
