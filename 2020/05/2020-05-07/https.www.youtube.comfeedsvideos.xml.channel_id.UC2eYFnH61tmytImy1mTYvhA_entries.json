I haven't used i3 in more than a year now and I've never looked back. A couple years ago, there were few patches for dwm, no good tutorials and a small community of people developing and adding cool stuff to dwm, now literally everyone is doing it and dwm is the best. As I say in the vid, if anything, dwm has more features than most wms because suckless keeps an online repository of patches, even marginal ones that are super-easy to add to your own build. dwm werks really well out of the box, but the stuff you can do with it is really amazing.\n\nMy dwm build:\nhttps://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwm\nMy dwmblocks statusbar build:\nhttps://github.com/lukesmithxyz/dwmblocks\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\r\nDONATE NOW: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5r47Q1cn_o", "date_published": "2020-05-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
