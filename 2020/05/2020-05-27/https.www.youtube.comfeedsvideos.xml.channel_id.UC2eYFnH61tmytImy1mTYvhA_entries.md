You literally can't make any of this up. Deus Ex wasn't a game, it was an oracle. Soon the elites will be creating omnipotent nano-machines to merge with... Æleks Jownes was right all along...

All you need is a url of a video and a list of timecodes, I made a script that takes both and automatically splits and properly tags all the track in an album on YouTube (or chapters in an audiobook). I wrote this a while ago and have used it a lot and it's saved me a lot of effort. Check out the script below and see if it inspires you to optimize something you're trying to get done.
