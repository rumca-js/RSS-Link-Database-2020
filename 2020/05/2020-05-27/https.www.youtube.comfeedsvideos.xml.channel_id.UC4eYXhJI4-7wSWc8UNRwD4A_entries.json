Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nMay 28, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- \"We're not doing my original songs,\" Rhiannon Giddens says, before she and her partner, Francesco Turrisi, launch into an old spiritual, \"'cause with these kinds of emotions, the old songs say it best.\"\n\nThough acknowledging their good fortune \u2014 a place to live, a bit of savings, their children being safe \u2014 Rhiannon Giddens also pauses to tell us how the pandemic has altered their entire way of life. They canceled their tour of Japan and returned home to Ireland; Rhiannon lives in Limerick while Francesco lives a few hours away in Dublin where they recorded this Tiny Desk (home) concert. They're finding comfort in being together, making music together, thinking of their families in both Italy and the United States, and hoping to comfort us all with some down-home tunes. And with banjos, fiddles, a bodhr\u00e1n, and that stunning voice, it sure worked for me!\n\nSET LIST\n\"Black As Crow\"\n\"Spiritual\"\n\"Carolina Gals\"\n\"Last Chance\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4luI94cSi8", "date_published": "2020-05-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
