## Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath - Every New Fatality, Stage Fatality and Fatal Blow

The Aftermath expansion is now out for Mortal Kombat 11, adding a brand-new story, playable characters, and skins to developer NetherRealm Studios' fighting game. The three new characters are Robocop (yes, really), Sheeva, and Fujin.

In the video above, we take a look at all of the fatalities and fatal blows for the three new characters added in Aftermath. We also check out every new stage fatality as well, just to really make sure we fulfill that gruesome murder quota for any video having to do with Mortal Kombat.

If you like what you see, there are three ways to buy Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath. If you already have Mortal Kombat 11, you can just buy the Aftermath expansion for $40 USD or the Aftermath + Kombat Pack bundle for $50. If you don't have NetherRealm's game yet, you can also purchase Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath Kollection--which includes the base game, the Kombat Pack, and Aftermath.

In GameSpot's Mortal Kombat 11 review, Edmond Tran wrote, "MK11 isn't just a sequel for series fans and NetherRealm devotees, it's a gateway into the realm of fighting games for anyone who has a passing interest in watching ruthless warriors beat each other silly. Streamlined mechanics keep the act of fighting furiously exciting no matter what your skill level, and comprehensive tutorials encourage you to dig into the nitty-gritty. There's a diverse roster of interesting characters and playstyles, and the story mode is an entertaining romp. The randomization of Krypt rewards and the odd issue with the game's always-online nature can occasionally chip away at your patience, but Mortal Kombat 11 absolutely hits where it matters."

According to a Bloomberg report, Sony has PlayStation 5 reveals on the way, as soon as next week. Whether it'll be focused on hardware, games, or both, is still speculative. In confirmed news, Square Enix announced a new trilogy of Dragon Quest games based on a classic manga series, but at this time has only been announced for release in Japan.

Rockstar plans to spend $89 million on marketing in 2023. What the promotion is for hasn't been confirmed yet, but it's very likely to be Grand Theft Auto 6. Lastly, Fast and Furious: Crossroads gets a summer release date. For all the latest gaming news stories, be sure to get your Save State every Monday through Thursday on GameSpot.

Mortal Kombat 11's next expansion, Aftermath, is out now. It features a new cinematic story, three new fighters--Sheeva, Fujin, and RoboCop--and three more skin packs launching over time. Also featured in the new expansion are more "Friendships," which are the non-violent finishing moves that are nothing like the franchise's better known Fatalities and Brutalities. 

In this GameSpot video, we take a look at every character's Friendship--and they're pretty great. We won't spoil the surprise for you, so be sure to check out the full video to see what they are. 

Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath is out now for PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC. The expansion costs $40 USD.

The Last of Us was released in 2013 to rave reviews from critics and players. It tells the story of Ellie and Joel, two people caught up in a world where the Cordyceps Brain Infection has turned the majority of the human race into angry ravenous creatures. Usually the virus takes over the brain in a matter of days, but Ellie was bitten weeks prior and hasn’t turned. Ellie might be the key to finding a cure to the fungal infection, so the two travel across the country to meet up with the Fireflies, a militia group looking to restore the US government and find a vaccine. 

This video will recap the story of The Last of Us, as well as its story DLC, Left Behind, to prepare you for The Last of Us Part 2. We still recommend playing or replaying The Last of Us and Left Behind if and when you get the chance.

The Last of Us Part II was originally announced at PSX in 2016 and is set to be released on June 19, 2020 and takes place five years after the events of The Last of Us. You can check out our original review for The Last of Us and stay tuned for more coverage on The Last of Us Part II on GameSpot.
