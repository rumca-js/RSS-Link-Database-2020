## Faced with questions from MPs, Boris Johnson was like a blundering schoolboy | Martin Kettle

<p>His appearance at the Commons liaison committee saw him way out of his depth – on Dominic Cummings and everything else</p><p>Boris Johnson signed off this afternoon by telling the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/boris-johnson-grilled-by-mps-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-breach">Commons liaison committee</a> how much he had enjoyed his first meeting with them. If that’s true, then either I’m a Dutchman or Johnson has a weird way of having fun. No wonder he has managed to go almost a year before attending Westminster’s most prestigious committee. He came determined to say nothing new about Dominic Cummings and more or less managed it, though it came at a cost. On the wider issues of his government’s response to the pandemic, he mostly flannelled. Some of the questioners, notably Greg Clark, Stephen Timms, Robert Halfon and Darren Jones, beat him all ends up. Yvette Cooper delivered some icy remarks that should send shivers down his spine. Leadership Winston Churchill style it most definitely was not. Billy Bunter in the headmaster’s study kept coming to mind.</p><p>Johnson said he had spent a lot of time preparing for the meeting. It felt like a wasted effort. To expect the grasp of detail normally expected of a modern leader was and is hopeless. Issue after issue had to be parked, with promises of written replies later. Because he knew he had to be on his best behaviour in front of the assembled select committee chairs, there was less recourse to the irrelevant analogies and verbal folderols that Johnson often hides behind. The contrast with Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May – all of whom were consistently across the detail and submitted more often to attending the committee – was a painful one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/boris-johnson-blundering-schoolboy-commons-liaison-committee-dominic-cummings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>David Atkins’s legacy at the property firm is of two large deals that never happened</p><p>The property industry is a comfortable world of long tenures and long goodbyes. So it is that David Atkins, chief executive of Hammerson, can announce his departure sometime before next spring while his chairman, David Tyler, offers cheery slaps on the back for 10 years of terrific work. In most other industries, the duo would have been ushered out after the events of 2017-18.</p><p>To recap: the Atkins and Tyler combo proposed paying a magnificent £3.4bn for Intu, Hammerson’s smaller shopping centre rival.

George screamed. Screamed for his mother. Screamed for his breath. For his life.</p><p>For many watching the footage, George’s cries echoed Eric Garner’s “I can’t breathe.” New York police department officer Daniel Pantaleo killed Garner a couple of weeks before a Ferguson police officer killed Michael Brown. George’s plea reminds me of another black man shot by police: Eric Harris. In 2015, Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates told Harris “fuck your breath”.&nbsp;That same year, Fairfax county law enforcement tased Natasha McKenna four times while she sought help during a mental health crisis. As they were brutalizing her, she said, “You promised you wouldn’t kill me.” For me, the image of the white officer kneeling into George’s back reminds me most of Freddie Gray. Baltimore police severed Gray’s spine through an intentional rough ride in the back of a police van.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/george-floyd-police-violence-minnesota-racist">Continue reading...</a>

They were introduced to the former assistant general secretary by journalists who themselves knew him primarily as the author of a 1999 report.

<p>For many women, a loss of bladder control can be hard to talk about. No wonder there are so many misconceptions about everything from its effect on our sex lives to the best treatments</p><p>In many ways, incontinence is one of the last taboos when it comes to women’s health. For all the progress that has been made in other sensitive areas – such as women’s reproductive health, miscarriage and abortion – incontinence can still seem shrouded in silence. Culturally, we often joke about wetting ourselves laughing, yet for many of those affected by incontinence, the experience is anything but funny.</p><p>On a more positive note, says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/clarebournephysio/" rel="nofollow">Clare Bourne</a>, a pelvic health physio at <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sixphysio/" rel="nofollow">Six Physio</a>, the shame that many associated with this issue appears slowly to be dissipating. “I’m seeing a huge shift,” she says. “Lots of women have been in touch with me since I shared some recent work around prolapse. It’s still not being spoken about nearly enough, especially among younger generations, but it was encouraging to receive so many messages from women willing to share their experiences.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-taboo/2020/may/27/the-truth-about-incontinence-and-five-myths-we-need-to-bust">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This delicious cake-like porridge – baked in muffin cases for easy transportation – is the perfect way to start your day </p><p>Porridge has long been touted as the most healthy way to start your day. I have it most days and often have it for lunch or dinner. Over the years, I have experimented with every topping and flavour combination you can imagine. In the States, they bake it with sugar and eggs into a cake-like porridge called baked oatmeal. This is not only delicious, but also versatile. I bake mine in muffin cases so I can easily transport and reheat it. I have made a vegan version by using plant-based milk and flax egg, but it works well with cow’s milk and chicken eggs too. Flavours and fruit additions are totally up to you, and it can be fun to go with the seasons.</p><p><em>Makes 6 muffins.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/27/david-atherton-recipe-vegan-blueberry-baked-oatmeal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is more to strawberry recipes than just cream and sugar. Try pairing them with tomatoes, avocados, basil or harissa – if you dare</p><p>If you are not going to get out there and pick strawberries, the least you can do is eat them. Britain, farmers tell us, is facing a huge strawberry glut, thanks to the cancellation of major events such as Wimbledon (where 33 tonnes of strawberries were eaten last year), along with thousands of weddings and summer parties. As civic duties go, eating loads of strawberries isn’t that taxing, but they won’t sit around waiting for you to come up with new ways to serve them. Here are 17 delicious ideas to help you manage your personal stockpile.</p><p>Maceration is step number one in a lot of the recipes below. At its simplest, macerating consists of hulling and halving a quantity of strawberries, tossing them in a bowl with a couple of tablespoons of sugar, then leaving them to sit in the fridge for half an hour or longer, but not long enough for them to turn into mush (meaning not overnight). Additions to the basic formula may include juice (orange or lemon), balsamic vinegar or alcohol.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/may/27/one-punnet-of-strawberries-17-fantastic-ways-to-use-them-from-cake-to-ketchup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest in a Guardian Print Shop <a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture">series</a> is a portrait of an American tennis icon – yours to own for just £55 including free delivery</p><p>Billie Jean King (pictured at Wimbledon in 1975) was one of the most decorated tennis players of her era, winning 12 grand slam singles titles. Yet her career has been defined as much by her achievements off the court as by those on it. A lifelong campaigner for gender equality, she was one of the nine women who, in 1970, formed the Virginia Slams Circuit in protest at the lack of prize money in the women’s game and later became the first president of the newly-formed Women’s Tennis Association. She also swatted aside the former men’s pro Bobby Riggs in the so-called “Battle of the Sexes” – an exhibition contest borne of Riggs’s sexist belief that no female player could defeat him. The match was worth $100,000 to the winner, but, as King said, much more was at stake: “I thought it would set [women] back 50 years if I didn’t win that match – it would ruin the women’s tour and affect all women’s self-esteem.” She duly trounced her opponent in straight sets (6-4, 6-3, 6-3) in front of a global TV audience of almost 100 million. She recently urged other women to <a href="https://www.tennis.com.au/news/2020/03/08/inspirational-tennis-leaders-celebrate-international-womens-day">live their dreams</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/27/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-bille-jean-king-living-the-dream">Continue reading...</a>

She was, in the eyes of the ambulance crew who brought her in, probably beyond saving, possibly already dead. The woman had inhaled the sausage while laughing at a joke she’d been telling her family. I leant over her, used a laryngoscope to peer into her larynx, saw the sausage and extracted it. She took a big gasp, looked around in surprise, and after a short recovery, walked out of A&amp;E.

It’s a riff nonetheless, the instantly sticky sign of an unstoppable hit single. Firestarter was one of the biggest pop-cultural events of 1996 and by the end of the year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/prodigy">the Prodigy</a> were one of the world’s biggest bands. The Essex four-piece’s first No 1 was a flashpoint of teen angst, TV infamy, moral panic and tabloid outrage, carried aloft by big-beat pyrotechnics and a lethal barrage of lyrical vitriol. “Ban This Sick Fire Record,” squawked the Mail on Sunday – but it was much too late.</p><p>The Prodigy were already a dominant force in pop. All but one of their singles since 1991 had made the Top 15, including 1991’s Charly, the cartoon-sampling hit that famously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/mixmag-charly-kill-rave">“killed rave”</a>, according to clubbers’ bible Mixmag. Liam Howlett, the band’s musical engine, was bored with cranking out rave hits to a formula and started experimenting with elements of hip-hop and rock on their second album, Music for the Jilted Generation. Now the Prodigy were ready to reintroduce themselves as stadium-sized heroes with The Fat of the Land, taking dance music deep into the moshpit while promoting dancer-cum-hypeman <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/keith-flint">Keith Flint</a> to songwriter and vocalist. As an opening salvo, Firestarter was flamboyant, surreal, terrifying – and, like all the best pop songs, totally novel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/27/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-8-the-prodigy-firestarter">Continue reading...</a>

## Love Life review – HBO Max launches with a patchy, low-key rom-com

<p>The splashy new streaming platform kicks off with an easily binged if uneven show with Anna Kendrick as a woman whose relationships are analysed</p><p>There’s a canniness to the structure of slick new anthology series Love Life, which aims to analyse the dating history of one protagonist per season, each episode focusing on either a major or minor relationship. It’s an ambitious way to extend the constraints of a 90-minute, one-couple romantic comedy to a 12-episode examination of all the dating highs and lows someone experiences throughout their life, theoretically providing us with a depth often missing from the genre. But as nifty as this all might seem, it’s still an inarguably low-key way to launch HBO’s splashy new streaming platform HBO Max, given that Love Life is the only scripted original for adults made available from the late May kick-off. Comparisons to streaming competitors as well as – most damagingly – HBO’s regular content are inevitable and unfortunate.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/13/the-great-review-hulu-elle-fanning">The Great review – gleefully garish new series from The Favourite writer</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/27/love-life-review-hbo-max">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lockdown has seen the fashion world pivot from frocks to food, with models and designers sharing their favourite recipes online</p><p>Here are a few things that I have not done during the past two months. Wear high heels. Pick out a handbag because it works with a certain outfit and transfer contents into it from another bag. Go to the dry cleaners. Think about what I’m going to wear tomorrow. Change from a day to evening look, except on days when I have still been wearing my morning exercise gear at 6pm – and even then, I haven’t always bothered.<br /><br />And here, on the other hand, are a few things that I have done: made a souffle for the first time ever. Through trial and error, nailed a failsafe béarnaise sauce. Pitted bowls of cherries for clafoutis. Eaten a salad made from rocket and radish leaves that I grew myself. <br /><br />Making dinner is the new getting dressed in my lockdown life. Friday early evening once meant a drive-by visit to the kitchen for a G&amp;T, and then upstairs for the serious business of trying on eight different dresses before putting the first one back on again. Now, my day-to-night change means putting my hair into a ponytail so that I can cook, and then it’s straight to the kitchen. The deliveries I get excited about aren’t from Net-a-Porter, they are from the local butcher – and are almost as expensive, unfortunately. Instead of blisters on my feet from wearing my Prada sandals, I have welts on my forearms from being a klutz with a paella pan. The seasonal drops in stores I get excited about these days? Asparagus and alphonso mangoes. <br /><br />It’s not that I’m wearing disgusting clothes, I should add. I still love a nice summer dress on a sunny day and I have not gone a day without earrings. But without the context of where you are going out to, to do what, and with whom, and what they will be wearing, and how you are getting there and where you might end up later – without all that, getting dressed is a lot less spicy.</p><p>A simple diet of sundresses and sandals leaves me with time and headspace that I am sating by cooking. My love of clothes and fashion is always much less about shopping than it is an endless conversation inside my own head, and that conversation is much less involved than it usually is. For example: I have a pair of trousers that I used to think of as my “slightly nicer dog-walking trousers”. Now they are just “my trousers”. So the time I used to spend thinking about clothes and dressing up, is now all about recipes and cooking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/may/27/french-dressing-how-cooking-became-the-new-couture">Continue reading...</a>

<p> In a new book, the World Cup winner discusses growing up in France and the racism he encountered throughout his career<br /></p><p>One man in France’s 1998 World Cup-winning squad felt particularly affected by the sense of racial harmony that had descended on the country after that historic triumph. Ever since moving from Guadeloupe as a nine-year‑old, Lilian Thuram was confronted by discrimination. The attitudes he witnessed as a boy shocked him to such an extent that once his career ended, he decided to focus his energy on the fight against racism.</p><p>For those few happy weeks after the World Cup, Thuram was delighted to see people in France treated equally regardless of race. “The black-<em>blanc-beur</em> symbol we created was positive and I liked it,” he says of the “black, white, Arab” motto. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/may/27/lilian-thuram-classmates-judged-my-skin-colour-football">Continue reading...</a>

Hindman finally caught a break in 2002, one that allowed her to monetise her talent as a violinist. She was hired to play in an orchestra by a man she calls only The Composer. But she says she quickly realised the truth: she was to “play” in front of a dead microphone beneath a booming CD player, and her audiences, whether in a concert hall or a shopping mall, would never twig. “Sounds like Titanic!” someone gushed after one gig. The music did sound a little like the film’s soundtrack, and the line gave Hindman the title of her memoir. She did this job for four years. She was, as she writes, Milli Violini.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/27/milli-violini-fake-violinist-miming-orchestra-jessica-chiccehitto-hindman-memoir-sounds-like-titanic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new BBC film, Sitting in Limbo, recounts the story of Anthony Bryan, who was sacked, arrested, detained and threatened with deportation, before the government apologised. The reporter who broke the original story talks to his family and friends about the years of misery they endured<br /></p><p>A fantasy preview screening of the BBC’s powerful new drama Sitting in Limbo would have a handful of home secretaries lined up in the front row: Theresa May, Amber Rudd, Sajid Javid and Priti Patel – with David Cameron invited to sit alongside them. Further back, there would be places for the civil servants who devised immigration policy over the past decade, senior immigration enforcement officers and the governors of Britain’s immigration detention centres.</p><p>This memorable evening will, of course, never happen because of lockdown, and possibly also because this isn’t how the BBC organises its screenings. But I hope that these politicians and officials force themselves to watch the one-off drama at home when it airs in early June. They may find it uncomfortable viewing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/27/the-windrush-scandal-tv-drama-people-will-be-up-in-arms-when-they-see-this">Continue reading...</a>

Why has “this fortress built by Nature for herself against infection”, as Shakespeare described our islands, succumbed to a greater extent than any other European nation to a foreseeable and containable pandemic?</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/uk-government-pandemic">Part of the answer</a> is that the government knowingly and deliberately stood down crucial parts of its emergency response system. Another part is that, when it did at last seek to mobilise the system, crucial bits of the machine immediately fell off. There is a consistent reason for the multiple, systemic failures the pandemic has exposed: the intrusion of corporate power into public policy. Privatisation, commercialisation, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/07/outsourcing-coronavirus-crisis-business-failed-nhs-staff">outsourcing</a> and offshoring have severely compromised the UK’s ability to respond to a crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/27/privatisation-uk-disatrous-coronavirus-response-ppe-care-homes-corporate-power-public-policy">Continue reading...</a>

Cummings is the embodiment of the bewildering change that has transformed the country from clubbable member of the globalised world into a reckless, Brexit-voting outlier that is now enduring the biggest failure of statecraft since the 1930s.
