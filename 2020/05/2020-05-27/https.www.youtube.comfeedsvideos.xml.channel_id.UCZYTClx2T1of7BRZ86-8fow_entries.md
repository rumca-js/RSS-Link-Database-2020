Thanks again to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for partnering with us on this episode of SciShow. The Aquarium’s mission is to inspire conservation of the ocean. So give them a follow on their social media accounts or visit their website at http://montereybayaquarium.org. If you’re able to, please consider making a donation to help the Aquarium continue their mission while they’re closed. Your gift will be put to work immediately for ongoing animal care and maintenance of the Aquarium: https://mbayaq.co/2zbN5GX

Pelagic red crabs are actually lobsters - and that’s not even the weirdest thing about them! They sometimes wash up on shore in droves, signaling large scale climate events like El Niños and serving as a warning to marine biologists of our changing climate.
