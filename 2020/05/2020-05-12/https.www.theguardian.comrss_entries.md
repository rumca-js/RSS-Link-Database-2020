<p>How did a turbaned drag queen from the sexual underground of America’s deep south ignite rock’n’roll? We unravel the mystery behind Little Richard’s subversive genius <br /></p><p>As the world marks and mourns the passing of Little Richard, many have been asking: how was someone so unapologetically black and queer present at the origins of rock, a world-shaking music still associated, to this day, with white male musical acts like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones?</p><p>All these artists and more, including Bob Dylan in a Twitter thread, would be <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/09/little-richard-tributes-ferry-jagger-lewis-lee-duvernay">quick to acknowledge</a> Little Richard’s formative influence on them. But “influence” is perhaps too weak a word here. Rock’n’roll history has never exactly neglected or ignored Little Richard: it just has never quite known what to do with him. The longstanding pissing contest over who can claim the title “King of Rock’n’Roll” – Elvis? Jerry Lee Lewis? – is a case in point. While his authorised biographer went celestial in choosing to style Richard “<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/little-richard-an-appreciation-by-bill-flanagan-of-the-quasar-of-rock-n-roll/">the Quasar of Rock</a>”, perhaps we might do better to listen to the artist, introducing himself at the Club Matinee in Houston, Texas, in 1953: “Little Richard, King of the Blues … and the Queen, too!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/12/too-black-queer-holy-why-little-richard-never-truly-got-his-dues-turbaned-drag-queen-sexual-underworld">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic is a tough lesson in the workings of the natural world – and proves how vital a knowledge of ecology really is</p><p>Imagine mentioning William Shakespeare to a university graduate and discovering they had never heard of him. You would be incredulous. But it’s common and acceptable not to know what an arthropod is, or a vertebrate, or to be unable to explain the difference between an insect and spider. No one is embarrassed when a “well-educated” person cannot provide even a rough explanation of the greenhouse effect, the carbon cycle or the water cycle, or of how soils form.</p><p>All this is knowledge as basic as being aware that Shakespeare was a playwright. Yet ignorance of such earthy matters sometimes seems to be worn as a badge of sophistication. I love Shakespeare, and I believe the world would be a poorer and a sadder place without him. But we would survive. The issues about which most people live in ignorance are, by contrast, matters of life and death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/coronavirus-education-pandemic-natural-world-ecology">Continue reading...</a>

Five! Boris Johnson couldn’t even be bothered to turn up and grip the government’s crucial early response to a deadly virus – are we supposed to believe he’d be rushing back to finish a loft extension out of civic duty? He’s not even prime minister out of civic duty.</p><p>Still, that’s showbiz. You miss one universal credit meeting and your benefits are stopped; you miss five Cobra meetings and you get to address the nation on its working responsibilities from a drawing room so vast you’d need a hansom cab to traverse it. (When are we de-furloughing the hansom cabbies?

I wasn’t earning much at the time and I thought: “There’s no way, I just can’t.” But I know that if I had bought it, I would have kept it for ever – so it was one that got away, basically.</p><p>My daughters think I haven’t changed my style since the 90s [when Lowe was the vocalist of the indie bands Powder and Lodger and part of the “Primrose Hill set”, alongside Kate Moss, Jude Law and Sadie Frost].

My peers were into short hair, jeans, bomber jackets and I remember one saying to me: “I think you’d get more fans if you didn’t dress as glamorously – girls won’t like you.” But that was what I loved, that old-school glamour.

<p>Now is the perfect time to boost the biodiversity of any outside space you have – whether by buying your cat a bell or ditching the insecticides</p><p><br />With humans – and our polluting, road-killing, noisy machines – largely out of the way, nature is having a big party. This is one of the few positives of lockdown to which we can cling, witness and even encourage. “The land taken up by gardens in the UK is <a href="https://www.wildlifetrusts.org/habitats/towns-and-gardens">greater than the area of all our national nature reserves</a>,” says Mark Fellowes, a professor of ecology at the University of Reading who specialises in interactions between humans and wildlife, as well as urban ecology. Everyone with outside space, he says, “can become a nature reserve manager. You can do really simple things to affect biodiversity where you live.”</p><p>These days, even the most lackadaisical gardeners are taking a greater interest in whatever outside space they have, not least because panic food-buying seems to have segued into panic food-planting. Grow bags have become hard to come by and the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) has reported increased inquiries about growing fruit and vegetables.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/12/more-birds-and-bees-please-12-easy-expert-ways-to-rewild-your-garden">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest of a Guardian Print Shop <a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture">series</a> featuring classic sports images. Today’s picture is of the moment England won the 1966 World Cup final, beating West Germany 4-2 at Wembley </p><p>Forget the best known photographs from the 1966 World Cup final: Geoff Hurst smashing home the fourth goal (“They think it’s all over … it is now!”); Bobby Moore riding on the shoulders of his teammates with the Jules Rimet trophy raised aloft in his right hand. Those frames don’t quite capture the raw emotion of that historic victory as well as this image by Gerry Cranham. Shot at the final whistle, it features England’s manager, Alf Ramsey, in a state of shock, being congratulated by his colleagues. But the scene is wonderfully stolen by the physiotherapist, Harold Sheperdson, whose explosive leap punctures the boundary of the frame. Ordinarily, as a picture editor, you wouldn’t want a person’s hand to be chopped off like this. Yet, somehow it just feels right, here – as if the euphoria of winning the World Cup simply couldn’t be contained within the frame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/may/12/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-euphoria-at-the-1966-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

So, as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to take a toll on America, I wrote him a speech</p><p>There’s a moment near the end of most sports movies when the coach gives a heartfelt pep talk right before the crucial game. The coach will use words like “heart,” “honor,” and “teamwork”. Everything that happens on the court or field after that is a bit of a letdown because victory – whether on the scoreboard or of the spirit – seems inevitable after the speech. To movie audiences, these moments may seem corny, but in real life, when someone you admire and respect speaks, their words can have a great impact. I certainly listened when coaches I respected, <a href="https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2018/05/25/kareem-abdul-jabbar-coach-wooden-book">such as John Wooden</a>, spoke at crucial points during my career. Inspiring people to be their best is what great coaches – and great politicians – do. It’s one of the qualities that makes them great.</p><p>For the past few months, this country has faced a formidable opponent in Covid-19. It’s been kicking our butts across every state and the statistics are only getting worse. America has a deep bench of expertise and we know how to come together as a team when we need to.

<p>Easing social distancing without a proper programme of testing, contact tracing and isolating will lead to a second wave of coronavirus</p><p>There are no silver bullets, clever models or easy answers for how to control the coronavirus. But neither is it rocket science. Governments have three choices in how they respond. The first and most difficult path is to contain the virus through a programme of mass testing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/uk-coronavirus-app-could-be-ditched-for-different-model-after-trials">contact tracing</a> and isolating. This requires a huge effort: building a large infrastructure to monitor cases of the virus and identify hotspots, ensuring this system runs efficiently, providing adequate PPE to everyone who needs it, and deploying border controls to vet who is entering the country.</p><p>The second path is far simpler. It involves slowing the spread of the virus by using timed cycles of lockdown and release, with the government issuing guidance on how much social distancing is required. But the side effects of this path are very costly: it risks wrecking the economy, straining health and social care systems, and creating social unrest. The third and easiest path available to governments is simply to do nothing. The virus sweeps across the population, the economy remains open and whoever makes it through is lucky to still be alive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/tories-lockdown-social-distancing-testing-second-wave-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tracking and tracing the movements of people with symptoms of Covid-19 is key to the next phase of ending the lockdown. But as the government trials a contact-tracing app on the Isle of Wight, Alex Hern reports on concerns about privacy, effectiveness and trust</p><p>As the government begins to navigate the gradual exit from the coronavirus lockdown, it has been pointing to its contact-tracing app as one of the key pillars of its strategy. The app is being piloted on the Isle of Wight, where residents including<strong> Dr Tom Moore</strong> have been asked to download it and update it with any symptoms of Covid-19. If it is successful in alerting those who could be infected and relaying outbreak hotspots to the NHS, it could soon be rolled out nationally. </p><p>Before that though, there are a number of potential hurdles. As <strong>Alex Hern </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong>, parliament’s human rights committee has serious reservations on how data is handled, and there are concerns that uptake of the app will not be as high as needed and, perhaps most pressing of all, that it won’t work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/12/track-and-trace-will-the-governments-new-app-work">Continue reading...</a>
