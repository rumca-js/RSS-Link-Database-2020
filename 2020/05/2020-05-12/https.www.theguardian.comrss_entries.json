On the phone we made sure they understood the advice to stay in and that they had arranged food deliveries for the coming weeks. We checked they had a \u201ckey information summary\u201d \u2013 an electronic pr\u00e9cis of their principal medical issues \u2013 available for paramedics, A&amp;E and hospital staff to access should they become unwell.</p><p>In the first few weeks of the year, the pandemic had been a dreaded but distant anxiety.
