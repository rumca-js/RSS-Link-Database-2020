Season 5 has arrived in Apex Legends, and there are some big changes beyond just new legend Loba. Here's all the important stuff from the patch notes.

Loba is new to the game, but she's far from the only legend with new tricks. Mirage is getting a really big buff, which should totally change the meta for his character. When you release a decoy, you can press the button again to have it mimic every move Mirage makes: before this, the decoy simply ran forward in a straight line. The same goes for Mirage's Ultimate: now all those decoys will mimic his moves too. His Passive gets some special treatment too. You still cloak when you get knocked down, but now you'll also cloak when respawning at a beacon or reviving a teammate--they get the cloaking too. What's more, Mirage's "bamboozle" line will play when a decoy is destroyed, instead of when it gets deployed, which ya know, makes a lot more sense.

Now let's talk Loba. You probably know all about her by now, but if not, here's the important stuff. Her Tactical ability is called Burglar's Best Friend, and it lets her throw her bracelet and teleport to wherever it lands, making it a great ambush tool. Her passive, Eye for Quality, lets her spot Epic and Legendary loot through walls. Then there's her Ultimate, Black Market Boutique. Loba plants her staff in the ground, which pings all loot in the area. Everyone on the team can then check the staff to see a menu similar to a death box, listing all the good stuff nearby. Each squad member can take two pieces of gear for themselves, instantly transferring them to your inventory.

Other legends have been reworked for Season 5 too. These include cooldown and range changes to abilities like Gibraltar's Dome Shield and Bloodhound's Eye of the Allfather. Some of the most significant changes are tied to Caustic's gas canisters: they can't be triggered from the other side of a closed door anymore, and the gas won't slow down Caustic's teammates. GameSpot has the complete list of legend changes.

It's not just the characters that have changed either: Kings Canyon looks quite different now. Skulltown and Thunderdome are gone, with a new location called Salvage along the coast. Wetlands is gone, replaced by the new Capacitor. You'll also find new Charge Towers in Kings Canyon. Activate one, and any legend standing on the platform when the energy burst goes out will instantly have their Ultimate charged and ready to go.

Of course, a new season also means a new battle pass. There's another 100 tiers of rewards to unlock during Season 5, along with an all-new Quest system. Quests are a whole other story, so to learn more about them or anything else in the Season 5 patch notes, head to GameSpot. We'll see you in the Apex Games.

Unreal Engine 5 empowers artists to achieve unprecedented levels of detail and interactivity, and brings these capabilities within practical reach of teams of all sizes through highly productive tools and content libraries. 

Join Technical Director of Graphics Brian Karis and Special Projects Art Director Jerome Platteaux (filmed in March 2020) for an in-depth look at "Lumen in the Land of Nanite" - a real-time demonstration running live on PlayStation 5 showcasing two new core technologies that will debut in UE5: Nanite virtualized micropolygon geometry, which frees artists to create as much geometric detail as the eye can see, and Lumen, a fully dynamic global illumination solution that immediately reacts to scene and light changes.

What happens when you take Mortal Kombat 11’s beautiful graphics and mess them up? Well they become surprisingly delicious as it turns out. That’s what we find out in this week’s episode of Potato Mode.

Potato Mode is a series where we take your favorite games and turn their graphics into mush. We start by showing how good the game can look, and then we turn down the settings as low as we can, and then we go even lower using tools and programs outside of the game. The results are both fascinating and hilarious.

Make sure to come back for part 2 where we check out Mortal Kombat 11’s Aftermath expansion, which features a brand new story mode and new playable characters including Robo Cop. If you’re interested in more videos about Mortal Kombat 11 make sure to check out our written review of the game over on GameSpot.com and the video review on our YouTube channel.

We’re all chomping at the bit for Elder Scrolls 6 news, but Bethesda’s Pete Hines has tempered expectations by saying the game will be coming out after Starfield, and we still don’t really know that much about that either. Needless to say, it'll be a long while before Elder Scrolls fans get anything substantial.  

The Mafia Twitter account has sprung back to life after almost two years of being dormant. Its latest tweet has given weight to rumours that a Mafia 2 remaster is in development and is set to launch in 2020 to mark the game’s 10th anniversary. 

Ubisoft has announced its summer digital showcase, promising exciting game news, reveals, and more. And a new partnership between numerous game publishers and developers will also result in another big summer event. The big gaming celebration will include involvement from studios like Larian, ZA/UM, and Paradox Interactive.
