These techniques will also double frame rates and provide HDR support to game that didn't have them before. All backwards compatible games will also have Quick Resume support which will allow you to navigate between multiple xbox games and generations with ease. \n\nMortal Kombat creator, Ed Boon, appeared in a livestream recently to discuss PS5 and Xbox Series X. Persia goes over Boon's favorite feature for next-gen which is the slim-to-none loading times. Of course, great graphics are expected but Boon says load times are an underrated and door-opening part of next-gen gaming. \n\nPersia gives the PSA to Division 2 players as in-game audio files reveal spoilers for the Warlords of New York DLC. The in-game files are on the public test server and if you want to avoid having the story and future manhunt targets spoiled, steer clear of these audio leaks. \n\nE3 might not be happening this year but we've got you covered.

The three new characters are Robocop (yes, really), Sheeva, and Fujin.\n\nIn the video above, we take a look at all of the fatalities and fatal blows for the three new characters added in Aftermath. We also check out every new stage fatality as well, just to really make sure we fulfill that gruesome murder quota for any video having to do with Mortal Kombat.\n\nIf you like what you see, there are three ways to buy Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath. If you already have Mortal Kombat 11, you can just buy the Aftermath expansion for $40 USD or the Aftermath + Kombat Pack bundle for $50. If you don't have NetherRealm's game yet, you can also purchase Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath Kollection--which includes the base game, the Kombat Pack, and Aftermath.\n\nIn GameSpot's Mortal Kombat 11 review, Edmond Tran wrote, \"MK11 isn't just a sequel for series fans and NetherRealm devotees, it's a gateway into the realm of fighting games for anyone who has a passing interest in watching ruthless warriors beat each other silly. Streamlined mechanics keep the act of fighting furiously exciting no matter what your skill level, and comprehensive tutorials encourage you to dig into the nitty-gritty. There's a diverse roster of interesting characters and playstyles, and the story mode is an entertaining romp. The randomization of Krypt rewards and the odd issue with the game's always-online nature can occasionally chip away at your patience, but Mortal Kombat 11 absolutely hits where it matters.\"\n\n#MK11Aftermath #MortalKombat11Aftermath #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-n9hePz42nU", "date_published": "2020-05-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Outriders New Gameplay Livestream | Outriders Broadcast #1", "description": "The first Outriders broadcast will showcase new gameplay, new locations, never-before-seen powers, character class breakdowns, development updates, and more.
