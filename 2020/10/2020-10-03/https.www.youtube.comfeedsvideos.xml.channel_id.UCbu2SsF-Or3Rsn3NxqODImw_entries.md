After years of development and multiple delays, CD Projekt Red's hugely anticipated open-world RPG Cyberpunk 2077 is almost here. With its November 19 release date rapidly approaching, we're diving deep into the lore of Cyberpunk, and this continues today with a new video focusing on the varied districts of Night City that you'll be exploring in your journey in Cyberpunk 2077.

Night City was planned to be the city to surpass all other cities, and the coastal Californian metropolis has certainly lived up to that reputation for better and worse. In the new video, Jess covers the seven main districts in Night City, including City Center, Watson, Westbrook, Heywood, Pacifica, Santo Domingo, and The Badlands.

As you'll see in the video, these locales are each varied and unique, giving players something new to see and do, no matter what their interests are. While there's plenty more details to be mined from the tabletop game Cyberpunk 2020, that should give you a pretty good idea of the regions you'll be questing through in Cyberpunk 2077. Check out the full video and let us know what you think!

As always, let us know what other lore topics you'd like to see covered in our next video, be sure to check out our previous episodes, and we'll see you again soon.

Cyberpunk 2077 launches on November 19 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC, while it will also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
