With its November 19 release date rapidly approaching, we're diving deep into the lore of Cyberpunk, and this continues today with a new video focusing on the varied districts of Night City that you'll be exploring in your journey in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nNight City was planned to be the city to surpass all other cities, and the coastal Californian metropolis has certainly lived up to that reputation for better and worse. In the new video, Jess covers the seven main districts in Night City, including City Center, Watson, Westbrook, Heywood, Pacifica, Santo Domingo, and The Badlands.\n\nAs you'll see in the video, these locales are each varied and unique, giving players something new to see and do, no matter what their interests are.
