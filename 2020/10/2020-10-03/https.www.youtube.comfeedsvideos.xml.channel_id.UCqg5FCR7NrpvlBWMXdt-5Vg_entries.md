This week on The Escapist Movie Podcast, Bob Chipman, Jack Packard, and Darren Mooney go down the decades for some Horror movie recommendations. 2020's "Blood Quantum" is a standard Zombie flick from a fresh perspective, "In the Mouth of Madness"(1994) is an eerie John Carpenter movie that has plenty of gooey puppets, and "House"(1985) is a rare example of a monster as a LITERAL metaphor.
