But I got very close!\n\nAnd I learned a lot in the process. I'm putting everything here: https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com\n\nAfter I learned the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board comes with a PCIe slot, I know the first thing I thought about testing was a graphics card. The Mali GPU inside the Pi 4 is decent on its own, but what if you could use external video cards, for mining, for rendering, or for CUDA or other GPU-accelerated computing purposes?\n\nSo that's what I sought to try out in this video, going boldly where... a couple others have gone before, but unsuccessfully!\n\nCheck out all the PCIe devices I'm testing: https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\n#RaspberryPi #ComputeModule\n\nProducts I used in this video (some links are affiliate links):\n\n  - Zotac Nvidia GeForce GT 710: https://amzn.to/3mttxRq\n  - VisionTek AMD Radeon 5450: https://amzn.to/3mttwgk\n  - I/O Crest 4-port SATA card: https://amzn.to/3kzP4Y7\n  - Intel I340-T4 NIC: https://amzn.to/34ylhtm\n  - Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4: https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/compute-module-4/\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:10 - Zotac Nvidia GPU\n02:20 - Trying Nvidia's ARM drivers\n03:39 - Go to the BAR\n05:39 - Trying CUDA\n06:28 - Switch to AMD Radeon\n07:44 - Trying the Nouveau driver\n09:09 - Recompiling the Kernel\n10:15 - That pesky IO BAR\n11:25 - Rationale and next steps\n12:29 - Pi PCI website\n12:54 - Bloopers", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ikpgZu6kLKE", "date_published": "2020-10-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
