Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | October 28, 2020 \nSuperstar songwriter Ty Dolla $ign has too much history with NPR Music and too many hits under his belt to deliver us just any ol' Tiny Desk from home. He assembled a roster of frequent collaborators (including Skrillex) under one roof to perform some jams from his new album, aptly titled Featuring Ty Dolla $ign, as well as a few of his chart-topping singles.\n\nWhile many know Ty as pop's go-to feature artist, the Los Angeles native has steadily crafted his own diverse catalog, with more than a dozen albums, mixtapes and EPs to his name. With Featuring, he flips the script, roping A-list pop stars \u2014 like Post Malone, Nicki Minaj, Future and Young Thug \u2014 into his own world, using them to define the Ty Dolla sound.\n\nThis Tiny Desk (home) concert was a long time coming. Ty visited the NPR Music offices last year, where he performed an emotional tribute to Mac Miller, and it's something we'll never forget, but he wanted to start fresh and focus on the music of Featuring. Fast forward more than a year later, and we finally have that full-length Ty concert so many of you have been asking for.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Temptations\"\n\"Something New\"\n\"Or Nah\"\n\"Paranoid\"\n\"Ego Death\"\n\"Your Turn\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTy Dolla $ign: vocals, guitar, drum machine\nSkrillex: DJ, guitar, samples\nAnt Clemons: vocals\nJoe Cleveland: bass\nMike Moore: drums\nCamper: keys\nBrandon Chapman: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nMixing Engineer: Rafael \"Fai\" Bautista\nProduction Manager: James Stuckmann\nRecording & Mixing Engineer: Ruben \"Jigga\" Pinto-Castillo\nMonitor Engineer: Roderick \"Rock\" Vincent\nDirector: Amber Park\nProduction Company: her Productions\nDirector of Photography: Ben Goodman\nProduction Designer: Evaline Huang\nEditor: Jessi Casprowitz\nSupervising Editor & Post Producer: Aaron Bencid\nEdit House: Slice Edit\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_-I2y1YPsM", "date_published": "2020-10-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "GroundUP Music with Becca Stevens, Bokant\u00e9, Alina Engibaryan And More: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nSuraya Mohamed, Colin Marshall | October 27, 2020\nThis three-act, 18-person Tiny Desk (home) concert was conceived by Michael League, Snarky Puppy's composer and bandleader. He and his cadre of artists on the GroundUP record label believe in two important points: that music and politics are inextricably linked, and the best way to connect people is through song.\n\nLeague's rolodex is impressive. If you're a jazz fan, you're almost certain to know many of the performers in this ambitious Tiny Desk, which includes (among others) Grammy winners Gregory Porter, Brad Mehldau and Chris Potter.\n\nThe concert features three distinct ensembles, beginning with Becca Stevens and her song \"Heather's Letters To Her Mother.\" \"I wrote this for Heather Heyer, who was killed on August 12, 2017, while peacefully protesting the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville,\" she says. \"In my heart this song has always been a rallying cry to come from a place of compassion in our actions and reactions. It's a reminder to continue the fight for equality from a determined and compassionate stance regardless of what is happening around us. And it's a reminder to stay grounded in love because without a foundation of love we are truly lost.\"\n\nThe second song features League's world music group Bokant\u00e9 performing the Creole song \"R\u00e9parasyon,\" meaning \"reparations.\" Bokant\u00e9 vocalist Malika Tirolien wrote the song, which appears on the band's Grammy-nominated album What Heat. \"With the rise of black liberation movements around the world, this is a crucial time to remind everyone that people of African descent need the slave trade officially recognized as a crime against humanity and need reparations and restitutions of stolen goods,\" Tirolien says. \"Getting justice is the only way we can begin a process of forgiveness and healing.\"\n\nKeyboard player and vocalist Alina Engibaryan leads the last song, \"We Are,\" which strives to bring people together, \"I wanted to write a song that has a message about people, where regardless of our beliefs, our political views, our race, color, we are all human beings and made of the same thing,\" Engibaryan says. \"I hope people will understand that one day and will learn to love, respect and accept one another.\"\n\nSET LIST & MUSICIANS\n\n\"Heather's Letters to Her Mother\" performed by Becca Stevens\n\nBecca Stevens: vocals, guitar\nBrad Mehldau: piano, vocals\nChris Tordini: bass, vocals\n\n\"R\u00e9parasyon\" performed by Bokant\u00e9\n\nMalika Tirolien: vocals\nKurt Rosenwinkel: guitar\nRoosevelt Collier: lap steel guitar\nBob Lanzetti: guitar\nChris McQueen: guitar\nMichael League: bass\nKeita Ogawa: percussion\nJamey Haddad: percussion\nAndr\u00e9 Ferrari: percussion\nWeedie Braimah: percussion\n\n\"We Are\" performed by Alina Engibaryan\n\nAlina Engibaryan: vocals, Rhodes, Moog bass\nGregory Porter: vocals\nChris Potter: tenor saxophone\nTaylor Eigsti: piano\nEric Harland: drums\nMichael League: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Chris McQueen\nAudio By: Chris McQueen, Michael League\nProducers: Colin Marshall, Suraya Mohamed\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jUVHWe09GQ", "date_published": "2020-10-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
