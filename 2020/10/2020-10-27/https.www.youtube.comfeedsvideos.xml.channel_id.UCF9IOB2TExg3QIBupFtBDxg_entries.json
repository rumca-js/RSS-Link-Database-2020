The point is that the rate of increase is decreasing, if we carry on decreasing the rate of increase, soon we will have no increase in new cases. When there is no increase R will be zero. After this R will fall below 1 and so the new cases will reduce. BUT, we must continue the current measures to continue the reduction in the rate of increase.\n\nAs cases have increased in overall numbers, hospitalisations and deaths will inevitably follow. People dying today contracted the infection a month ago. This means deaths will continue to increase, but should reach a peak in late November, then start to drop. This is as long as the rate of increasing cases continues to decrease.\n\nhttps://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases\n\nhttps://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8885157/Britain-records-367-Covid-19-deaths-darkest-day-end-May.html\n\nCases, + 22,885 =
