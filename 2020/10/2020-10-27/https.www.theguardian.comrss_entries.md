## The Sister review – a nail-biting whodunnit that is truly haunting

<p>Russell Tovey and Bertie Carvel star in the latest thriller from Luther writer Neil Cross, complete with dark forests, ghostly apparitions, and mountains of dread</p><p>It’s cold(ish). It’s dark. It’s the week leading up to Halloween. You’re probably in the mood for a quick and dirty hit of something dramatically moreish, put in the safe hands of some top-tier actors, tinged with the supernatural and stripped in four parts over the week to watch with the curtains pulled tight, are you not? Well, the Lord – or ITV – has provided. The Sister, which started on Monday and continues nightly until Thursday, is a supernaturally-tinged dose of nail-bitery, doled out in suspenseful chunks and starring Russell Tovey and Bertie Carvel.</p><p>The tale properly began one rainy, windswept night with a man (a round-shouldered, stringy-haired Carvel, all Dickensian malevolence and creep) turning up on the well-appointed doorstep of happily married thirtysomething Nathan (Tovey) to plunge him into terror with the words: “They’re digging up the woods.” For Nathan has a secret and it’s quite a good ’un. Which is to say – a bad ’un. We come to realise – via the medium of flashbacks to limp bodies being dragged out of cars, dark nights and darker forest paths – that Nathan was intimately involved with the disappearance of his wife Holly’s sister, Elise, about seven years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/27/the-sister-review-a-nail-biting-whodunnit-that-is-truly-haunting">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Netflix<br /></strong>From Helen Mirren as Trump’s wingman to<strong> </strong>Marisa Tomei as Satan, this Netflix special is a<strong> </strong>funny and striking document of what living feels like in this fraught and febrile year</p><p>How do you turn a handful of lip-sync videos on TikTok into a Netflix special?

<p>While we were all looking through old family images, up popped one of my husband in all his glory. Should we discuss this with our 13-year-old or pretend it never happened?</p><p><strong>My husband of 10 years used to travel a bit on business, and we would send each other explicit photos and videos of ourselves. I thought I had hidden all incriminating images in a protected folder on my phone, but, the other night, while I was randomly flicking through old family videos with my husband and 13-year-old stepson, up popped a video of my husband in all his glory, holding himself. There was stunned silence from the two of us, then panicked laughter, while my stepson looked at me with a bemused “busted!” expression. He still seems unconcerned about it, but both of us feel terrible. Should we have a conversation about it, wait to see if he acts any differently towards us, or trust our first instinct, which was to be a bit embarrassed and then pretend it never happened? We’re not a prudish household, but we figure that forcing him to talk could make this episode even </strong><strong>weirder</strong><strong> and more awkward than it already is. What should we do?</strong></p><p>Our children pick up on our attitudes towards sex without any words being spoken. In fact, the most powerful learning they receive is the unspoken message. They easily absorb how each parent views sex, through our reactions when sexual content appears on TV, or the way we react when someone alludes to sex in conversation. Given that unspoken messages are the most powerful ways parents communicate ideas and feelings about sex, you have already let your stepson know everything he needs to understand about this. He is old enough to put it into context, and if he questions you in the future your job is to simply give a relaxed answer. You were right to normalise the accidental revelation, and there would be little point in returning to the subject.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/27/my-stepson-saw-an-explicit-video-of-his-dad-on-my-phone-what-should-i-do">Continue reading...</a>

He remembers one of those children vividly. “Whenever I looked in the mirror for traffic, he would just be going …” Sharp gawps down the lens of his Zoom camera for me, eyes vacant, jaw hanging down. “He never said thank you, like the others. He never said anything, he just stared. I thought, this kid is so rude.”</p><p>Thirty years later, the same kid turned up at Pat Sharp’s house. He wanted to help write his autobiography and he had an unusual idea about how to go about it. “All that time in the car, he must have been making plans,” laughs Sharp. “And he did apologise for never saying thank you. He said: ‘I just couldn’t believe the guy who presented Fun House was driving me to school.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/27/pat-sharp-my-mullet-was-cool-but-i-couldnt-have-it-now-id-look-like-joe-exotic">Continue reading...</a>

Daniel Craig introduced them, a few weeks before the new Bond film was due to be released. “I was shitting bricks if I can be totally candid,” the slightly less famous Daniel says.<br /><br />Fifteen days later, Covid-19 locked down New York. Stuck in his flat, his studio out of bounds, Lopatin had to make music in his bedroom like he did when his recording career began. Granted, life had changed since his 2007 debut, Betrayed in the Octagon: he’d spearheaded a genre, vaporwave, by narcotically slowing down excerpts of well-known songs, and collaborated with David Byrne, FKA twigs and Iggy Pop. He still had a poky bedroom, though. “If I’d pushed my chair back making music, it would hit the bed and I’d end up hurting my ankle,” he laughs, sitting in the same room on an autumn afternoon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/27/oneohtrix-point-never-uncut-gems-adam-sandler">Continue reading...</a>

Working in the hot June sun. Two are together, one stands apart. The two are practising finishing – the other encouraging, coaching, feeding them endless balls to try to score with. They are relentless in their quest to become better. They are Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Ruud van Nistelrooy. They are being schooled by René Meulensteen, a Dutch skills coach who will one day manage Manchester United reserves and have Ole as his assistant. Then one day René will be part of Sir Alex Ferguson’s inner circle, becoming first-team coach. For now, he is drilling Ole and his countryman Van Nistelrooy ahead of their coming internationals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/27/ole-gunnar-solskjaer-making-of-the-manager-manchester-united">Continue reading...</a>

Like Dickens with Oliver Twist, 10 years earlier, she sought to move the heart of middle England. Hunger could no longer be accepted as natural or inevitable.</p><p>In Gaskell’s novel, “hunger-stamped” men from Nottingham, Sheffield, Glasgow, Manchester and other industrial cities implore parliament in vain to act on the “unparalleled destitution of the manufacturing districts”. John Barton, a chartist and trade unionist who is one of the delegates, knows hunger. As a young child, he and his mother (who dies “from absolute want of the necessaries of life”) had hidden their hunger so his younger siblings could eat. His “little son, the apple of his eye” dies of starvation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/27/victorians-felt-sympathy-hungry-children-government-gaskell-hardy-poverty">Continue reading...</a>

## Ammonite is not the evolutionary leap for lesbian film it thinks it is

<p>Francis Lee’s much-hyped film in fact belongs to a recent tradition of studiously tasteful, sexually fixated work in which lesbians are a world apart</p><p>Lesbians have a love-hate relationship with cinema, a place in which, Andrea Weiss wrote in her <a href="https://andreaweiss.net/books/vampires-and-violets/">1992 work Vampires and Violets</a>, only one image of the lesbian may surface at any one time. For at least the past half-decade (since the release of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/26/carol-film-review-cate-blanchett-todd-haynes-rooney-mara">Todd Haynes’ adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s Carol</a>) that image may look something like this: a period drama with an oedipal understory, chronically white, a sombre mood, dialogue exactingly stark. A sensorium of touch and taste, the space between bodies, and the yearning therein. A fantasy for all audiences to enjoy..</p><p>In these films, the action is silently displayed on faces and behind eyes, before it’s finally loosed in the form of a long, drawn-out sex scene. In 2013’s Blue Is the Warmest Colour, the camera hovers over the lovers’ faces so intimately that you can see the spit as they kiss, the pores on their cheeks, the ecstatic boredom in their eyes. The erotic and romantic ache of Carol is generated from across-the-room looks and sudden touches.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/27/ammonite-is-not-the-evolutionary-leap-for-lesbian-film-it-thinks-it-is">Continue reading...</a>

It took a village, in other words, and then a load of other villages.

<p>Ballooning Tory spending in response to the pandemic does nothing to redistribute wealth, but it does buy voters </p><p>It has been said of Boris Johnson that he is now “more Castro than Castro” and that the economy is now more “<a href="https://www.itv.com/news/2020-10-22/can-boris-johnson-nationalise-the-economy-only-for-a-year">socialist … than at any point in British history</a>”. This is, of course, plainly not true. Socialism is normally understood as common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange – with power in the hands of workers and citizens, rather than shareholders – and the fundamental aim of a society of equals. The temporary expansion of state spending during a global pandemic is obviously not the same, and the current government is plainly relaxed about inequality.</p><p>Yet it is hard to overstate the scale of that expansion. Between March this year and next, the Office for Budget Responsibility <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/bulletins/publicsectorfinances/august2020">forecasts an increase in government borrowing</a> of £372bn. That’s three times the <a href="https://nhsproviders.org/media/689303/nhs-providers-briefing-march-2020-budget.pdf">annual budget for the entire NHS</a> or about 15% of the <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/grossdomesticproductgdp">entire UK pre-pandemic economy</a>.

<p>Many of us have struggled to maintain our fitness in 2020 – but not everyone. Here, four people explain how they improved their sleep patterns, diet and exercise regimes</p><p>Before Covid-19, an ordinary evening for Tim Ludford, a charity worker, looked something like this: after-work drinks with colleagues; an Uber home; a takeaway. “Not healthy takeaways, either,” says Ludford, 37, from London. He would polish off a curry for two people before nailing a bag of Maltesers or a packet of biscuits.</p><p>Ludford’s relationship with food began to deteriorate after the death from cancer of his father in 2013. “I was unhappy, first of all, and I was bingeing on food and alcohol as a coping mechanism,” he says. “A lot of it was related to my dad, but I was also stuck in a rut and food was an easy way to make myself feel good.” By the time lockdown was introduced, he was severely obese, with a BMI of 40. (A healthy BMI is between 18.5 and 24.9, according to <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/obesity/">the NHS</a>.) “Sometimes I’d do crazy things,” he says. “If I was on the way to meet someone for dinner, I’d go to KFC on the way. And then I’d eat dinner as well.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/27/i-got-a-whole-new-mindset-the-health-secrets-of-people-who-got-much-fitter-in-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Children with learning disabilities and their families need support that is kind, compassionate and thoughtful</p><p>In late July 2019, I tweeted asking families with autistic or learning disabled children to share their experience of “sparkling” actions by health and social care professionals. I was writing a book about how professionals could make a difference in the lives of children and their families, and the manuscript was woefully negative.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/emmadimps/status/1156484743896162304?s=20">The tweets</a><strong> </strong>started appearing and <a href="https://twitter.com/sarasiobhan/status/1156278091150479360?s=20">the thread</a><strong> </strong>grew across the next few weeks. They included extraordinary examples of what I came to call “pockets of brilliance”. An administrator who included pug memes in the appointment letters for a dog-loving young patient. Professionals who were prepared to sit on the stairs so a child could stay in their bedroom during a visit. The GP who told one mother: “I don’t know very much about autism, but I promise you that I will do all I can to learn.” Another GP who rang a mother in the evening after he’d been kicked during a distressing appointment, gently asking what he could do to help. These behaviours could be badged as “reasonable adjustments”, but to give them any type of label is part of the problem. The shoehorning of human actions based on kindness, thought and sense into jargon dehumanises what should be everyday, normal conduct.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/27/after-scandals-like-winterbourne-view-why-is-basic-decency-still-remarkable">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The auteur’s bold and brutal 2000 adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr’s cultish novel about addiction remains an indelible and shocking act of provocation</p><p>I was 17, and just beginning university, when Requiem for a Dream descended on cinemas like an opaque, bruise-blue mist. Notwithstanding the no-under-18s restrictions stamped upon it by stern censors in the UK and elsewhere, I like to think I was the optimal age for it. Darren Aronofsky’s addiction drama may be cross-generational in its focus, but with its unremittingly punishing storytelling and frenzied, all-systems-go cinematic energy, it represents a very young person’s idea of how a very adult film looks, sounds and spasms. I loved it, even as it followed me through a tertiary arts education to the point of overkill: its poster gracing umpteen friends’ dorm rooms, its Clint Mansell/Kronos Quartet string theme – and its countless remixes – soundtracking all manner of student theatre pieces and presentations, its formal and literary flourishes seized upon by many a hip professor seeking a modish mutual reference point.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/sep/14/almost-famous-at-20-cameron-crowe-warm-hearted-ode-to-music-journalism">Almost Famous at 20: Cameron Crowe's warm-hearted ode to music journalism</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/27/requiem-for-a-dream-at-20-aronofskys-nightmare-still-haunts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As she releases a box set of her earliest recordings, in a rare interview Mitchell talks about life before fame, the correct way to sing her songs – and her long struggle to walk and talk again after an aneurysm</p><p>“I was lying in bed last night thinking about getting a cat,” says Joni Mitchell. It’s an early summer Sunday, and she’s sitting in her backyard patio, nicknamed Tuscany. Behind her a bird feeder is busy with hungry visitors. “And <em>this guy </em>shows up at the gate around midnight, meowing.”</p><p>A light-brown kitten with long white paws, only a few months old, leans contentedly against her shoulder. “I hope nobody comes to claim him,” she confides softly. They’re fast friends. Nearby Marcy Gensic, Mitchell’s longtime friend and associate, mentions they’ve papered the neighbourhood with lost notices. No calls yet. So with our midnight visitor, tentatively named Puss ’n Boots, tucked in the lap of this treasured artist, Mitchell is here to discuss the new set of early recordings she never intended to release: Joni Mitchell Archives Vol 1: The Early Years (1963-1967). For years she doubted their place in the revered canon of her carefully curated albums. “Some of the melodies are beautiful,” she told me in an interview in 2004, “but they’re very ingenue-y.” She seemed almost wistful. “God, they’re so vulnerable in these tough times. They’re like some ancient world.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/27/joni-mitchell-interview-archives-early-years-cameron-crowe">Continue reading...</a>

## US election 2020: are Democrats taking black voters for granted in Wisconsin?

<p>The Guardian US reporter Kenya Evelyn grew up in Milwaukee, in the swing state of Wisconsin. She recently returned to see how this year’s pandemic, recession and Black Lives Matter protests are shifting the city’s politics</p><p>In recent years, Wisconsin has come to play a crucial role in deciding the presidential election. In 2008 and 2012, Barack Obama comfortably won there. But in 2016, Donald Trump took the state by a margin of just 23,000 votes. That year, 93,000 black voters in the city of Milwaukee stayed home on election day. </p><p>The Guardian US reporter <strong>Kenya Evelyn </strong>recently returned to her home city and tells <strong>Mythili Rao</strong> what she heard when she spoke to black voters about what this election means to them. The Democrats had expected to hold their convention in Milwaukee – but when the pandemic forced the party to go virtual, an anticipated $200m economic boom instead <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/businesses-milwaukee-impact-virtual-dnc/story?id=72412666">spiralled into a substantial loss</a>. The pivot was also the final straw for many of the city’s African American residents. The coronavirus shutdown worsened national crises that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/14/coronavirus-us-racial-bias-black-latino">disproportionately devastated black Americans</a> across the country, exacerbating racial inequalities in Milwaukee. Many activists told Evelyn that it could stifle local efforts to solicit enthusiasm for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a> and his running mate, Kamala Harris. It’s a warning for Democrats not to take black voters for granted.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/27/us-election-2020-are-democrats-taking-black-voters-for-granted-in-wisconsin">Continue reading...</a>
