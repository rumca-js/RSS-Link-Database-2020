He\u2019s a writer whose career can be usefully arranged in decades. There was the apprenticeship of his 20s; then in his 30s a run of unforgettable, name-making novels \u2013 <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/16/jonathan-coe-carve-book-club\">What a Carve Up</a></em><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/16/jonathan-coe-carve-book-club\">!</a></em>, <em>The House of Sleep</em>, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/the-rotters-club-9780241986479.html\">The Rotters\u2019 Club</a></em>. Then it felt as if Coe went off the boil a little, with the books of his 40s and 50s \u2013 <em>The Rain Before It Falls</em>, <em>The Terrible Privacy of Maxwell Sim</em><em> </em>and <em>Expo 58</em> in particular \u2013 all lacking the verve and humour of his earlier work. Coe at his best was that rare thing: a writer of page-turners that are full of postmodern flourishes, <em>jeux d\u2019esprit</em> that also engage profoundly with important subjects. In the Costa prize-winning and bestselling <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/nov/25/middle-england-jonathan-coe-review\">Middle England</a></em>, he seemed to recapture the warmth and sharpness of his mid-career masterpieces.</p><p>Following up a success is never easy and yet the life and light that flooded <em>Middle England </em>is preserved and multiplied in <em>Mr Wilder &amp; Me</em>. This is a book that looks back to Coe\u2019s brilliant early period, engaging, like <em>What a Carve Up!</em>, with cinema in a formal as well as a thematic way, delivering the reader a satisfyingly sweeping novel that still manages to push the form in new directions. It hinges on 60 pages in the middle of the book when the narrative morphs suddenly into an approximation of a Billy Wilder script \u2013 but this is a film in which Wilder himself is the star. We meet \u201cBillie\u201d as a young man, in the war, when he betrayed a lover and made a film that in some way compensated for this betrayal. The script colours all the story around it and is one of the most strangely moving pieces of writing I\u2019ve read in years. Coe\u2019s best novels always sounded tricksier in summary than they were when you read them.

Born in London in 1775, into a world ruled by aristocrats and monarchs where the horse was the fastest thing on earth, Turner lived to see the coming of trains, steamships, political reform and photography \u2013 and the abolition of the slave trade.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/26/turners-modern-world-review-tate-britain-london\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/26/turners-modern-world-review-tate-britain-london", "date_published": "2020-10-26 09:00:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "With blockbusters on hiatus, could small indie films save cinema?", "description": "<p>Emerging director Guy Davies cold-called cinemas to get his coming-of-age romance Philophobia shown \u2013 and it worked</p><p>Getting a small, independent movie into cinemas is a huge challenge at the best of times.
