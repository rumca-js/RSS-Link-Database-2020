Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk to¬†Doug Wilson. Doug is a pastor, author of over 90 books, most recently of¬†Ride, Sally, Ride, and the host of¬†Man Rampant. His church got in the news recently for a non-socially distanced, unmasked 'Psalm Sing' in Moscow, Idaho that landed several members of their church in jail. They talk about what happened at the Psalm Sing, why churches¬†are disengaging with the culture and politics, and why a Christian would write a book about sex robots.
