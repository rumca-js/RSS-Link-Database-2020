If you want to copy files, make backups, transfer massive files, update your website, update files smartly minimizing bandwidth, rsync is basically the best. It's a command line tool for file transfer and is easily scriptable. I use it actually all the time for moving stuff on or off my local computer.

rsync makes keeping your website up to date mega-easy. To setup a website, see this based playlist:
