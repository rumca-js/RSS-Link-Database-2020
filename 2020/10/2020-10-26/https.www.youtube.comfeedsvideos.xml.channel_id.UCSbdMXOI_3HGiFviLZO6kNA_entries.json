This is probably some of the most exciting news we've seen regarding the Quest 2 and the VR industry lately. Also I will be covering the DecaGear One, a new VR headset from a seemingly unknown company that is promising some of the best, industry leading specs and features for a price that is lower than all of its competition. This is probably one of the most exciting, important weeks of news we have had all year, and Im here for it. I will also be holding a live interview with DecaGear later this week at Twitch.tv/Thrilluwu\n\nHere are my links:\n2nd Channel and Meetup video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZO_KOqt46Q\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nJoin my discord for good times\nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nPatreon link:Join\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nGAMERSUPPS Discount Code: THRILL\nhttp://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=thrill\n\nSources:\nhttps://www.tweaktown.com/news/75874/decagear-1-is-4k-vr-headset-with-face-and-hip-tracking-for-449/index.html\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/decagear-background-roadmap-or-kuntzman/\nhttps://twitter.com/OculusSupport/status/1320439489278476288\nhttps://twitter.com/CixLiv/status/1320068735730733056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1320068735730733056%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3%2Ccontainerclick_1&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Ffacebook-bans-oculus-owners-with-multiple-headsets-191421857.html\nhttps://www.techradar.com/news/oculus-quest-vr-headsets-are-being-held-to-ransom-by-facebook-and-your-vr-games-are-at-risk\nhttps://www.popsci.com/story/technology/vr-headset-display-tech-solar-panels/\nhttps://www.engadget.com/samsung-stanford-10000-ppi-oled-display-200949600.html\nhttps://community.openmr.ai/t/sde-and-ppi-pimax-vs-valve-index-vs-others/20032\nhttps://www.deca.net/decagear/order/\nhttps://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-11-28-phil-spencer-nobodys-asking-for-vr-on-xbox\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/VR_memes/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/terms.php", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBTqn5vyb-4", "date_published": "2020-10-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
