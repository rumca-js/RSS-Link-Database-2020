At least half or participants must be flowed up for 2 months after their second dose

These recommendations are specific to COVID-19 vaccines, which are complex biological products that are intended to be administered to millions of individuals, including healthy people, to prevent disease. 

Data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccineâ€™s benefit-risk profile, 

WHO

https://vaccine-safety-training.org/vaccine-reactions.html

There is low public tolerance of vaccine adverse reactions. Vaccines are therefore only licensed when the frequency of severe reactions is very rare and when only minor, self-limiting reactions are reported
