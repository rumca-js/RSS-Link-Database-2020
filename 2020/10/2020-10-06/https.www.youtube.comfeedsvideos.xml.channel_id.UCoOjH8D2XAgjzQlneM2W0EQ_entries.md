This is the race against aging.

In Scottsdale, Arizona lies a unique company called the Alcor Life Extension Foundation. One of only four companies in the entire world that specializes in Cryonics. For an affordable price $50/mo + life insurance, Alcor will have a medical team for you on standby. Once the day arrives when you’re pronounced dead, they’ll rush a team out to your body, and then rush your body back to their facility where they’ll “freeze” your body to cool. They’ll keep your body there until hopefully one day, we’ll be able to revive you back to life. 

Before Sept 2013, the field of aging and life extension was pretty pathetic. But a man named Bill Marris was about to change that stigma. He pitched the idea for a startup aimed at curing aging to the Google co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin and they loved it. 

On Sept 18, 2013, Google’s mysterious new company called Calico launched in an effort to manufacture something that Silicon Valley has never been able to make: time. And this new movement has led to some remarkable advancements in recent years, including the rise of one Professor by the name of David Sinclair. 

As time goes by, your DNA gets naturally damaged from things like UV light, so your cells have to repair your DNA and epigenome. Sinclair has been able to figure out ways to slow down the damage to your epigenome, and thus, slow down aging. We’re able to reverse aging all together for a group of cells. He’s working on how to reverse the age of the entire body. David Sinclair has been featured on Joe Rogan, Veratasium, etc.

Then there’s Neuralink from Elon Musk. Instead of curing aging head on or freezing you after you die, Neuralink’s goal is to work around your existing body. That’s where their brain machine interface comes in - a computer chip that wires directly to your brain. Neuralink’s goal is to not only read these signals, but to also send the right signals to your brain to counteract things like memory loss, hearing loss, blindness, paralysis, depression, strokes, and more.

Solving immortality? “The world has witnessed big plays before, but what was bigger than death?” “When forever comes, will we be able to survive it?”
