In the wake of President Donald Trump’s COVID-positive diagnosis, and as cases spike in parts of the country, “America’s Medical Supply Crisis” examines why the United States was left vulnerable to key equipment shortages — and why problems persist, months into the coronavirus crisis. 

This excerpt looks at how, in the wake of H1N1 and prior to COVID, neither Congress, the Obama White House or the subsequent Trump administration moved to substantially replenish the Strategic National Stockpile, or SNS.

The documentary “America’s Medical Supply Crisis,” a collaboration between FRONTLINE, The Associated Press and the Global Reporting Centre, will be available to stream in full beginning Tues., Oct. 6: https://to.pbs.org/3cYaR8Q
