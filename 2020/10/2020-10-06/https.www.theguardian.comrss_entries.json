The Human Rights Act exists as a safeguard against such offences, protests the government: an entirely disingenuous argument given that, as Reprieve\u2019s executive director Anna Yearley tells me, \u201cjust a few months ago in court, and again last week in parliament, it argued that the act doesn\u2019t apply to crimes committed by its agents\u201d.
