<p>There is nothing very deep or challenging to find in this tale of a 20-something’s romantic New York endeavours. But the comic writing is effortlessly good</p><p>Ever since her fierce, funny and, well, pitch perfect turn in Pitch Perfect, I have known that I would trust Anna Kendrick with my life. And by life, I mean entertainment. Two things that are rapidly becoming synonymous. And now, just when I need her most, up she pops in her first major television outing obviating even the need to rent a movie (or, of course, go to the cinema – on which glorious endeavour, as with all golden memories of the Before Times, the less we dwell the better).</p><p>In the 10 half-hour episodes of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08nbxcw">Love Life</a> – created and written by Sam Boyd – Kendrick (who also executive produced) stars as Darby Carter, whose millennial misadventures in both the love and the life we follow at the rate of roughly one per instalment, moves through New York and her post-grad 20s and on into her 30s. So the opening episode has her in 2012 hoping for the kind of relationship in which, as narrator Lesley Manville – yes, our Lesley Manville! – explains in voiceover, you don’t have to change into a new outfit to meet up. “You just wear what you’re wearing because you are who you are.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/06/love-life-review-romcom-anna-kendrick">Continue reading...</a>

Hall, who previously took the £15,000 prize in 2013, won the annual competition again on Tuesday night for The Grotesques, a “timeless and unsettling” story that explores privilege, inequality and mother-daughter relationships in a university town. The prize, which is supported by Cambridge University, is initially judged blind.</p><p>“In perhaps the strongest field in the history of the award, Hall’s story still stood out,” said chair of judges and Guardian journalist Jonathan Freedland. “A timeless, unsettling story rendered in exquisite prose, The Grotesques yields more with each reading, offering layer upon layer of meaning. It is the work of a writer who is not only devotedly committed to the short story genre but has become a master of it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/06/master-of-short-story-sarah-hall-becomes-first-to-win-bbc-prize-twice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Contrary to the impression Johnson might have given over the past decade, he now says Britain was broken before he became prime minister. But where’s his plan to fix it?<br /></p><p>“France in 1789. Russia in 1917. The Europe of the 1930s. The pandemic of 2020. They are all junctures where the river of history changes direction,” wrote the historian Margaret MacMillan earlier this year. Her thesis, <a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/05/09/margaret-macmillan-on-covid-19-as-a-turning-point-in-history" title="">outlined</a> in the Economist newspaper, was that the pandemic had exposed society’s weaknesses and strengths. Once revealed these can shape the public mood, lighting fires that could create warmth and comfort or burn and destroy with revolutionary zeal. How the story unfolds – whether the pandemic is pivotal rather than mutinous – will depend, wrote Prof MacMillan, on leadership.</p><p>Boris Johnson’s coronavirus stewardship has been disastrous. The utter incompetence and abject lack of strategy at the heart of his government has seen his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/26/labour-takes-poll-lead-as-parties-see-major-switch-in-fortunes" title="">poll ratings</a> drop and has rattled Conservative MPs. Covid has spread, with hospitalisations and death rates rising. In the last few months, Mr Johnson has only provided broken promises and empty hyperbole. His claim that there will be no restrictions on sizes of gatherings and no social distancing by September next year <a href="https://twitter.com/JGForsyth/status/1313428526943662080" title="">betrays</a> how desperate things have become.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/06/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnsons-speech-the-politics-of-a-pivotal-moment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Clubs want fans back to make up for lost revenue but the top flight still spent more than £1bn in the transfer window</p><p>To contemplate Premier League clubs’ transfer window mega-spending, even in the best of times, is a time-honoured exercise in being flabbergasted, in shaking of heads that the game has gone, the world has gone mad. And however much English football still must do and decide upon as its teams’ shouts echo in the depths of its empty grounds, everybody can agree on one thing: these are not the best of times.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/jul/30/transfer-window-summer-2020-all-deals-europe-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-ligue-1-serie-a">£1.</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/jul/30/transfer-window-summer-2020-all-deals-europe-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-ligue-1-serie-a">45bn</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2020/jul/30/transfer-window-summer-2020-all-deals-europe-premier-league-la-liga-bundesliga-ligue-1-serie-a"> spending on new players</a>, mostly from overseas, is only 11% less than Premier League clubs spent in the far-off, carefree summer of last year, when this pandemic life could not have been imagined and had barely been conjured up in dystopian fiction.

<p>Months of concerted effort by all involved risks being buried beneath off-field confusion surrounding Sale<br /></p><p>The knife-edge upon which professional rugby union is balancing grows more precarious by the day. As with many parts of the leisure industry, Covid-19 has ruthlessly exposed vulnerabilities that might otherwise have stayed hidden. It has also shone a harsh light on the sport’s administrators and the leadership – or lack of it – they have shown in the game’s starkest hour of need.</p><p>It cannot be easy and making certain decisions must have been painful. Not half as painful, sadly, as some of the muddle-headed thinking that has emerged. What price the credibility of the Premiership when even the teams involved have had no firm idea who they will meet in the semi-finals on Saturday, none of the coaches could prepare their teams satisfactorily and more than 12 months’ worth of concerted effort by all involved risks being buried beneath off-field confusion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/oct/06/credibility-draining-away-from-premiership-leadership-sale-covid">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Newport Street Gallery, London</strong> <br />Shark tanks, cow’s heads, feasting flies and pill bottles … Hirst’s death-obsessed early work hits home just as hard now disease is all around us</p><p>There was <a href="https://www.apollo-magazine.com/damien-hirst-dead-butterfly-wings-outrage/">widespread disgust</a> a couple of years ago when Damien Hirst unveiled paintings consisting of thousands of butterflies trapped in acrylic. All I can say is, if you share that revulsion at the use of dead animals to make art, you may want to avoid this spectacular survey of his early work.</p><p>It begins with a shark sliced in sections, each preserved in its own tank of formaldehyde. But that’s nothing, even if you’ve noticed this appears to be a juvenile tiger shark, killed before it could breed. I say appears – the gallery just calls it a “shark”.

<p>Seldom can someone have so badly misjudged the mood of a nation </p><p>Even the very best conmen have their tells. Those little tics that give away the lies. And Boris Johnson has never been a particularly good conman. His tells are hidden in plain sight. The more pronounced the hand gesture, the greater the lie. You can just imagine the pounding the kitchen table must have got when he returned home after yet another IT lesson. But up until now, he’s got away with it – in his public life at least – because the country has been happy to collude with him. It wanted someone who could tell a few gags and promise that everything would be OK in the end. The narcissistic fantasist as national saviour.</p><p>But the last eight months have changed all that. The country has grown up in the time of coronavirus. Tens of thousands have died; hundreds of thousands have become ill; millions are feeling <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/14/uk-autumn-covid-19-redundancies-could-exceed-700000">frightened and insecure about their jobs.</a> Yet even though the prime minister has had time to move on, he appears to have learned nothing. Boris may himself have wound up in intensive care, yet he still wants to be Mr Good Time Guy, with gags about losing weight and arm-wrestling. But it’s becoming more and more of a struggle. His eyes that used to sparkle from the acclaim are now mere dead hollows. It’s possible that not even Boris believes in Boris.

<p>The landmark Japanese cyberpunk animation from 1988 re-emerges as a deeply strange nightmare about destruction and rebirth</p><p>A deeply strange message from the future is what this movie is here to (re)deliver: both post- and pre-apocalyptic, a nuclear-age parable of anxiety to compare with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/godzilla">Godzilla</a>. Akira, released in 1988, is the cult Japanese cyberpunk animation from director Katsuhiro Ôtomo, who also created the original manga serial. (It is set in the impossibly futuristic year of 2019, so maybe last year would actually have been the time to rerelease it.)</p><p>Thirty years on from a devastating explosion that razed the city, a new capital – Neo-Tokyo – has been born: sprawling, chaotic, like the LA of Blade Runner. The city is beset with violence from warring motorbike gangs, and by protesters rioting against unfair taxes. A hatchet-faced army officer says that Neo-Tokyo is “a garbage heap made of hedonistic fools”. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/06/akira-review-1988-japanese-anime-rerelease-katsuhiro-otomo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Where is the opposition to a bill that will make it legal for undercover agents to commit sexual assault, torture and murder?</p><p>When a British woman declared she had been “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/24/undercover-police-spy-girlfriend-child">raped by the state</a>” after having a child with an undercover officer hiding behind a false identity, it should have been a national scandal, a catalyst for an urgent reckoning. She was one of a dozen women who had sexual relationships with men who pretended to be their companions and allies in order to spy on their political activities. They courageously fought for justice, yet last night parliament passed a bill making it legal for undercover MI5 agents and police officers to commit crimes – including sexual assault, torture and murder – if this prevents a more serious crime or threat to national security. Only 20 Labour MPs <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/05/mi5-bill-prompts-second-labour-rebellion-in-two-weeks-jeremy-corbyn">voted against the bill</a>, defying Keir Starmer’s instruction to abstain.</p><p>Very few would dispute the need for undercover informants to break the law in certain circumstances to keep us safe. Campaigners have long argued for a legal framework for criminal acts committed by undercover agents, but while <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bill-c-51-bars-csis-from-committing-bodily-harm-sexual-violation-1.2938380">Canada prohibits </a>undercover agents from engaging in killing, bodily harm or sexual assault, no such limits have been enshrined in UK law. The Human Rights Act exists as a safeguard against such offences, protests the government: an entirely disingenuous argument given that, as Reprieve’s executive director Anna Yearley tells me, “just a few months ago in court, and again last week in parliament, it argued that the act doesn’t apply to crimes committed by its agents”. Future survivors of abuses committed by undercover officers will be barred from seeking justice, because their abusers will be protected from civil liability for the rest of their lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/06/labour-state-violence-opposition-bill-undercover-agents">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This challenging route over the Grampians passes through history, wilderness and glorious scenery</p><p>Scotland is rich in wild histories. Ruins, relics and the stories behind them are found throughout its more isolated landscapes − forgotten, overlooked and often hidden by dint of sheer geographical remoteness.</p><p>There was one particular journey and historical narrative I had wanted to follow for years. The Jock’s Road pass involves a traverse through empty glens and across the tops of desolate, whale-back mountains. I would tramp it north to south, leaving the chocolate-box Highland village of Braemar and breaking trail for 20km over high moorland, completing my route amid the steep crags and wooded hillsides of Glen Clova. Although possible to walk in a day, I opted for a leisurely pace, staying the night at one of Scotland’s most unusual mountain shelters along the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/oct/06/walking-adventure-in-scottish-highlands-jocks-road-history-grampian-scenery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a suburb of Chicago, the world’s first government-funded slavery reparations programme is beginning. Robin Rue Simmons helped make it happen – but her victory has been more than 200 years in the making</p><p>It began with an email. On an especially cold day in Evanston, Illinois, in February 2019, Robin Rue Simmons, 43 years old and two years into her first term as alderman for the city’s historically Black 5th ward, sent an email whose effects would eventually make US history. The message to the nine-member equity and empowerment commission of the Evanston city council started with a disarmingly matter-of-fact heading: “Because ‘reparations’ makes people uncomfortable.”</p><p>She continued:</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/oct/06/long-fight-for-slavery-reparations-evanston-chicago">Continue reading...</a>
