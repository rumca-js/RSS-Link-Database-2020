<p>With a second wave of Covid-19 well under way, workers need the lifeline of the job retention scheme more than ever</p><p>The daunting scale of the second coronavirus wave becomes clearer by the day. Figures published on Friday by the <a href="https://twitter.com/ONS/status/1322148487484657669" title="">Office for National Statistics</a> showed more than 50,000 new infections a day in the week to 23 October, up from 35,000 a day a week earlier. The numbers are surging in almost every part of the country and in every age group, with secondary school children showing a particularly steep growth curve. Figures for the week now ending seem certain to be higher still. As a result, tougher restrictions are being introduced across many areas of Britain, with more to come. Pressure for a fuller lockdown, like the ones announced in many of our neighbouring European countries this week, is growing.</p><p>This is therefore a very strange time for the UK government’s job retention scheme, better known as the furlough programme, to be closing down. Yet Saturday is the final day of the scheme that the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, introduced at the start of the March lockdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/30/the-guardian-view-of-the-end-of-the-furlough-terrible-timing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The tabloids are frothing about the R&amp;B singer’s ‘steamy’ new direction, but her sixth album blurs into one long slow jam</p><p>Over the years, pre-release leaks of big albums have provoked everything from collapses in sales of the actual product to legal action. But the unscheduled appearance of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/ariana-grande">Ariana Grande</a>’s sixth studio album in the darker corners of the internet earlier this week provoked something different entirely. “THANK U, SEX!” screamed the headline in the Sun (in reference to her last album, 2019’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/08/ariana-grande-thank-u-next-review">Thank U, Next</a>), above a news story that promised Positions would reveal “graphic detail about all-night romps”. The ensuing lyrical analysis proceeded in time-honoured tabloid style. They seemed to have forgotten to use the phrases “sexSATIONAL” and “too shocking to print in a family newspaper”, but otherwise it was all present and correct: from “x-rated” and “steamy” to “bares all” and “sizzling” to the classic implication that they were printing all this out of a sense of moral duty: “Lyrics that will shock many parents of her young fans.”</p><p>This must clearly irk the 27-year-old singer. All those weeks carefully teasing your new album via Twitter with coy snatches of lyrics, insistences that you’re so excited about it that you “can’t stop crying” and links to websites where fans can buy a bundle of three CDs (identical save for the marginally different poses on each cover), and you’re gazumped by a grotty British tabloid in full stick-it-up-your-punter mode. Though the Sun have a vague point. Positions arrived at short notice, a few days before the US election, which seemed pointed. But anyone who expected Grande to return to the vague politicking of 2018’s <a href="https://youtu.be/a7RMVA3qYUU">The Light Is Coming</a> – a track built around a sample of an angry rightwing crowd protesting Obamacare – is in for a disappointment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/30/ariana-grande-positions-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The children might not be able to roam freely this Halloween, but readers share their tips for ensuring they still have a frighteningly good time</p><p><em>John, copywriter, Gloucestershire<br /></em>While the kids enjoy exchanging Haribo with the neighbours once a year, trick or treat has never been a big event for us as a family. This year, we’re taking inspiration from the Pixar film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation">Coco</a>, which both my children love, and attempting our own version of the Mexican festival Día de Muertos (Day of the Dead). The idea of celebrating the lives of lost loved ones really appeals to me as I don’t think we’re great at dealing with death in British culture. My dad died last year, so we’ll be thinking of him, but we’ve also got lots of photos and items for our <em><a href="https://www.inside-mexico.com/the-day-of-the-dead-ofrenda-2/">ofrenda</a></em> (a sort of family altar), including my wife’s grandfather’s teddy bear, my uncle’s classy pink slip-on shoes, and various other keepsakes. We plan to tell some stories, eat some of their favourite foods, and basically have a party.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/30/forget-trick-or-treat-10-new-ideas-halloween-family-fun">Continue reading...</a>

He is improving. He doesn’t have one single injury since he came back from the last one. He didn’t miss one single training session.

In the season of early closing and six-people-max tables, outdoors is where it’s happening, so your “party season look” this year needs to be full-coverage and fully lined. It’s a coat.</p><p>A coatfit is a coat that’s also an outfit. It needs to be a look, not just a layer.

Busted proteges McFly provided a credible halfway house: they wrote their own songs, they played their own instruments, they were funny and youthful and cool. Behind every perky All About You or Star Girl, there was a Too Close for Comfort or Not Alone, hinting at darker emotional places. To my young millennial ears, they were trailblazers, putting a hefty dose of personality back into pop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/30/the-return-of-mcfly-will-the-cheeky-pop-punkers-finally-get-their-due">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s been 40 years since he left one of TV’s most iconic roles. But far from being stuck in the shadow of Who, Tom Baker continues to relish its legacy – and lend the franchise his voice</p><p>“I miss Waitrose terribly,” Tom Baker says in those unmistakable tones. “And Boots, and the places I used to go without realising how dependent I was on them.”</p><p>The year of coronavirus is treating the veteran actor well on the whole, he explains, “because I live in the country and have a garden and some woodland and a cat and a wife”. But there is a melancholy and a reminder of his own mortality when he does venture out. “When my wife and I go for a spin, I drive to Tenterden [in Kent] and – we don’t sob exactly – but it gets solemn as we catch a glimpse of the hardware store, and Boots, and Waitrose, and then we turn round and come home again. Then I go down to the paradise of my woods and think: ‘Well, eventually it will pass.’ Another voice, of course, says: ‘Yes, but by then you’ll be gone.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/30/tom-baker-being-loved-pleases-me-very-much-indeed">Continue reading...</a>

## In 1953, Britain openly removed an elected government, with tragic consequences | Gaiutra Bahadur

<p>The overthrow of Guyana’s ruling party by colonial forces fomented a racial divide that continues to blight its politics<br /></p><p>For generations, a parable involving outside intervention has circulated in Guyana, formerly British Guiana, in South America. The story goes that soldiers sent in to suppress the independence movement fixated on homes flying red flags, believing them to be a sign of Communist allegiance. Instead, they were Hindu prayer flags. I’ve encountered this tale in a self-published memoir, in a yarn told me by one of the country’s former attorney generals, in speeches edging cane fields. On the eve of a tarnished <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/16/janet-jagan-guyana">independence</a>, the local Hindu establishment did protest that British troops, looking for concealed weapons, were targeting homes flying the sacred pennants. But the story has gained the quality of folklore. Sometimes, it’s accurately set in 1964, two years before independence. Sometimes, it’s misremembered to be 1953 – a year that carries its own significance, as it was when Britain <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/26/mi5-files-coup-british-guiana">overthrew</a> the country’s democratically elected government.</p><p>Hope had been sown earlier that year by an unexpected victory in an election that extended, for the first time, the vote to people who couldn’t read English and didn’t meet income or property requirements. With 75% of this new electorate casting ballots, the rhetorically brash, inexperienced People’s Progressive party (PPP) surprised even themselves by winning 18 of 24 legislative seats. Its founder-leaders were a cinematically attractive couple with Marxist leanings: Cheddi Jagan, the Chicago-educated dentist and homegrown son of plantation labourers who became premier, and his Chicago-born wife, Janet Rosenberg, a nurse by training. The premier’s charisma extended beyond beaming good looks to a chemistry with the rural poor that the Bajan novelist George Lamming described as “a fundamental unbroken link with the earth, with the people from down there”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/30/1953-britain-guyana">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson will struggle to unite ‘blue wall’ MPs and shire Tories on Brexit, planning reform, ‘wars on woke’ and more</p><p>The Conservative party’s north-south divide isn’t just about lockdown. It’s in the party itself. As the newly formed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/27/rebel-tory-power-base-aims-to-tackle-uk-north-south-divide">Northern Research Group</a> (NRG) of Tory MPs representing Wales, the north of England and the Scottish borders pressures Boris Johnson to do more to help their regions, a divide is forming in the party between the two sides.</p><p>As a general rule, northern Tory MPs tend to have been elected more recently, represent a higher number of blue-collar workers in their constituencies and be more unambiguously pro-Brexit. By contrast, southern Tory MPs tend to occupy seats that have been Tory for decades and represent more affluent voters – though obviously this doesn’t apply to all of them; left-behind coastal communities in the south have more in common with those in the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/21/red-wall-areas-facing-brexit-job-shock">red wall</a>”.

<p>Responses to the news vary from person to person. Mine just happens to include sleepwalking</p><p>Four days out from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/oct/28/us-election-live-2020-donald-trump-joe-biden-barack-obama-latest-presidential-elections-news-updates">US election</a>, and everyone is feeling tired and emotional. It is hard to focus, easy to agonise, and soothing – if the volume of pain on social media is anything to go by – to share with the group one’s inability to function. This is not limited to people living in the US, but – as with the recent death of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/ruth-bader-ginsburgs-legacy-will-survive-the-bitter-battle-over-her-successor">Ruth Bader </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/20/ruth-bader-ginsburgs-legacy-will-survive-the-bitter-battle-over-her-successor">Ginsburg</a> and ascent of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/oct/27/amy-coney-barretts-appointment-is-a-wake-up-call-for-female-voters">Amy Coney Barrett</a> to the supreme court – is felt by plenty of observers abroad as acute and very personal pain. People are, by their own admission, weeping, paralyzed, grief-stricken, terrified, frozen, nauseous and bingeing. You can’t turn it off. There is no escape.</p><p>At least this is the impression one gets after spending too long online. How we live psychologically in relation to the news is something we are assumed not to have much control over. You can be an ostrich and happy or that guy trapped in a feedback loop of conspiracy theories on Facebook – but nobody wants to be him. Or you can be informed and miserable, on which count not feeling completely dismantled at the moment is a dereliction of civic duty. Who runs the US affects the rest of the world, and it is not outlandish for Brits – or, say, affluent New Yorkers, insulated from the worst effects of a Trump re-election – to be emotionally disturbed ahead of the election. What remains curious is whether the sheer levels of reported distress are to any degree optional, or entirely related to the trauma at hand.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/30/despair-denial-run-up-election-night-news">Continue reading...</a>

I shan’t say it will break my heart, but it will,” says Pratt, who is selling his sheep and retiring after 55 years of uplands farming. “I’ve had a flock of sheep since I was 14, so I’m ready for a break,” he adds.</p><p>The 69-year-old tenant farmer works seven days a week and takes six days of holiday a year. Since 1966 he has been renting Kilnmire Farm (with no heating in the house) on the edge of Ravenstonedale village in Cumbria with his wife, Hazel. He doesn’t drink alcohol (he’s Methodist) and doesn’t have a mobile phone because he “wouldn’t know how to use it”. He tried an olive for the first time in 2017. It’s a lifestyle none of his three children is willing to take on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/30/un-managing-the-land-the-hill-farmers-helping-to-rewild-britain-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>White supremacist extremism is the most lethal terrorism threat to the United States. It’s a hateful ideology that the Guardian’s Lois Beckett says has infected many parts of American society</p><p>In May 2017, <strong>Demetria Hester </strong>was on her way home from work on a train in Portland, Oregon when Jeremy Christian, an avowed white supremacist, boarded and began shouting racist abuse. She says she told him to shut up. When they had got off the train, he threw a bottle that struck her in the face. The next day he killed two men and grievously injured a third. Demetria describes to <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> how she felt the police responded to the incident that night and how she watched her attacker walk away without being questioned. <br /></p><p>Earlier this year, a court in Portland found Jeremy Christian guilty of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of first-degree attempted murder and sentenced to life without parole. But as the Guardian’s <strong>Lois Beckett</strong> tells Anushka, this is the extreme end of an ideology that has permeated all parts of US society, and that President Trump has repeatedly refused to condenm. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/30/us-election-2020-donald-trump-and-the-rise-of-white-supremacist-extremism-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester City and United have found the right formula, Leicester are still looking for it, and Fulham need a win</p><p>“Manchester United struggle against a low block” is a criticism trotted out so regularly that it is accepted as fact, but the reality is somewhat different. When any Premier League team defends deep and in numbers, scoring goals against them is difficult. Since signing Bruno Fernandes, United have played 33 games, winning 22, drawing seven and losing four, the defeats linked not by the opponents’ set-up but by United’s poor goalkeeping, defending, finishing and fitness. They look to have resolved those issues, and may also have found the best way of setting up. Though a 4-4-2 diamond means selecting only two of Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial – who is suspended for Sunday’s game – the formation makes the strikers extremely difficult to mark. A tight midfield four behind affords the defence greater protection and allows Ole Gunnar Solskjær to pick two playmakers. After a long search, United look to have found the right balance. <strong>DH</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/30/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
