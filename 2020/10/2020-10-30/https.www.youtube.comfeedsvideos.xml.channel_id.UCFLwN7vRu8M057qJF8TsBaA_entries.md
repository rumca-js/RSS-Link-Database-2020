This month I review Minecraft VR as a Halloween video, and surprise surprise it’s an absolute nightmare and this is why. I will say though Minecraft VR this is now one of my favourite VR games, so take the criticism with some salt, it’s really fun.

I felt my channel was moving away from VR too much, and what way to bring it back than with Minecraft VR, probably the most popular game you can play in VR. To be honest I pandered a bit with this one. I tried to make it like my Skyrim VR review. SO the first thing I did was sit down and make a list of all the things that make me think of Minecraft. Creepers, TNT, Lava, Mods, and covered them all in detail as the video goes on. 

Making this Minecraft VR review was in fact though an absolute nightmare, I really over did the number of edits and scenes required. Basically, I hope you really like it.
