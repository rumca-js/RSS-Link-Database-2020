On this date (October 29) in 2013, Frank Turner visited our studio for a session. It was actually Turner's second visit to The Current studio, and he's visited us a handful of other times since then. In addition to being a great songwriter and performer, Turner is also a fascinating interview. And when he's done with the session, he'll often hang around and chat longer just because he's a really nice guy and a great conversationalist. In looking back on our archives, here are three cool performances Frank Turner has done in our studio through the years.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Recovery" (2013)
3:35: "Blackout" (2018)
7:00 "Sister Rosetta" (2019)

PERSONNEL
Frank Turner – vocals and guitar
Matt Nasir – mandolin (2013 and 2018 performances)
