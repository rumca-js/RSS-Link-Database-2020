Sometimes they\u2019re not better or worse, they\u2019re just different players. For example you look to Ronaldo and Messi, and compare them with seven years ago. They play in different areas, different positions. They transform their qualities to try and explore their qualities in other responsibilities in the tactical system of their teams. I think it happens with the majority of the players, so for sure he is a different player. Every word that I told on Wednesday I believe in them because he is working very, very hard. He is improving. He doesn\u2019t have one single injury since he came back from the last one. He didn\u2019t miss one single training session.

The story goes that soldiers sent in to suppress the independence movement fixated on homes flying red flags, believing them to be a sign of Communist allegiance. Instead, they were Hindu prayer flags. I\u2019ve encountered this tale in a self-published memoir, in a yarn told me by one of the country\u2019s former attorney generals, in speeches edging cane fields. On the eve of a tarnished <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/16/janet-jagan-guyana\">independence</a>, the local Hindu establishment did protest that British troops, looking for concealed weapons, were targeting homes flying the sacred pennants. But the story has gained the quality of folklore. Sometimes, it\u2019s accurately set in 1964, two years before independence. Sometimes, it\u2019s misremembered to be 1953 \u2013 a year that carries its own significance, as it was when Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/26/mi5-files-coup-british-guiana\">overthrew</a> the country\u2019s democratically elected government.</p><p>Hope had been sown earlier that year by an unexpected victory in an election that extended, for the first time, the vote to people who couldn\u2019t read English and didn\u2019t meet income or property requirements. With 75% of this new electorate casting ballots, the rhetorically brash, inexperienced People\u2019s Progressive party (PPP) surprised even themselves by winning 18 of 24 legislative seats. Its founder-leaders were a cinematically attractive couple with Marxist leanings: Cheddi Jagan, the Chicago-educated dentist and homegrown son of plantation labourers who became premier, and his Chicago-born wife, Janet Rosenberg, a nurse by training. The premier\u2019s charisma extended beyond beaming good looks to a chemistry with the rural poor that the Bajan novelist George Lamming described as \u201ca fundamental unbroken link with the earth, with the people from down there\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/30/1953-britain-guyana\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/30/1953-britain-guyana", "date_published": "2020-10-30 11:55:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Health chief in England's worst-hit Covid area calls for immediate lockdown", "description": "<p>Dominic Harrison says 3-tier system \u2018highly unlikely\u2019 to reduce infection or protect NHS</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The public health chief in England\u2019s worst-hit coronavirus area has called for an immediate three-week \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d across the country, calling Boris Johnson\u2019s current approach \u201cthe worst of all possible outcomes\u201d.</p><p>Prof Dominic Harrison, the director of public health at Blackburn with Darwen borough council, said it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that the strictest tier 3 restrictions would reduce the infection rate or protect the NHS.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/30/health-chief-in-englands-worst-hit-covid-area-calls-for-immediate-lockdown\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/30/health-chief-in-englands-worst-hit-covid-area-calls-for-immediate-lockdown", "date_published": "2020-10-30 11:24:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sports quiz of the week: Six Nations, subs scoring hat-tricks and a sell-out", "description": "<p>Who strayed?

When any Premier League team defends deep and in numbers, scoring goals against them is difficult. Since signing Bruno Fernandes, United have played 33 games, winning 22, drawing seven and losing four, the defeats linked not by the opponents\u2019 set-up but by United\u2019s poor goalkeeping, defending, finishing and fitness. They look to have resolved those issues, and may also have found the best way of setting up. Though a 4-4-2 diamond means selecting only two of Marcus Rashford, Mason Greenwood, Edinson Cavani and Anthony Martial \u2013 who is suspended for Sunday\u2019s game \u2013 the formation makes the strikers extremely difficult to mark. A tight midfield four behind affords the defence greater protection and allows Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r to pick two playmakers.
