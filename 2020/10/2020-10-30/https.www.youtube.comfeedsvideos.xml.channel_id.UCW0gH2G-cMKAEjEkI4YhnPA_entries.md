The Oathbreakers, the Forgotten, the Dead Men of Dunharrow - these former men of the White Mountains have many names.  Today, we trace their history from their beginnings as Second Age worshippers of Sauron to their cursed lives as wraiths in the mountains - doomed to never rest in peace, until the heir of Isildur should call on them once more.
