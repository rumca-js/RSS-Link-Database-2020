From hardware launches, revisions, and partnerships to peripherals, and of course, the games that we love on PlayStation, we delve deeply through the history of the console family.\u00a0\n\nShe also stops to examine the evolution of the DualShock controller, from its humble beginnings to its reinvention as the new DualSense Wireless Controller. We recently had hands-on time with it, and it's a marked improvement on the DualShock 4. PlayStation 5 launches on November 12 in the US, Canada, Japan, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, and South Korea, and on November 19 in the rest of the world.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cy5rEG_5U3Q", "date_published": "2020-10-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Everything We Know About Xbox\u2019s First Party Games", "description": "With 22 studios under its roof, Microsoft has a lot in the works for its Xbox Series consoles. To help keep track of it all, this video goes over every franchise Xbox Games Studios has cooking in the kitchen.\n\nHost Kurt Indovina goes down the list of all 22 Xbox Game Studios companies, detailing what they've worked on and what they have coming up. 343 Industries, the Halo-focused studio, is of course working on Halo Infinite, but the Forza Horizon-centric studio, Playground Games, is developing an all-new Fable. Then there are other studios that have their fingers in many different pies, such as Obsidian. The Outer Worlds developer is working on several games at once, including Grounded and Avowed (hopefully a new Fallout: New Vegas, too). Or Ninja Theory, the developer of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice and Bleeding Edge, is working on Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and Project: Mara.\u00a0\n\nThere's plenty of newly formed studios like The Initiative, Microsoft's \"AAAA\" studio, that hasn't announced what it's working on yet. The new developer is made up of industry veterans from big studios such as Naughty Dog, Bungie, and Crystal Dynamics. Though there's no confirmation on what it's working on, there are rumors of it reviving the Perfect Dark franchise.\n\nBut what about MachineGames? Is it working on another Wolfenstein? Same with Roundhouse Studios--is it developing the next Prey? While there are some unanswered questions, this video will equip with you the knowledge of what studios are under the Xbox umbrella and an idea of what's on the way.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN8_4BQd5pc", "date_published": "2020-10-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Free Xbox One & Xbox 360 Games With Gold For November 2020 Revealed", "description": "The November Games with Gold for November 2020 have been announced.

You can check out the full results of our benchmark in our written review, but to summarize it, the RTX 3070 essentially performs on par with the RTX 2080 Ti. That's impressive considering that the RTX 3070 goes for around $500 MSRP and that the 2080 Ti was last generation's enthusiast-level card that sold for over $1000.\n\nIf you're trying to get top-notch performance at 4K, the RTX 3080 is a better card but the 3070 can certainly hold its own at that resolution. At 1440p, the performance gap closes somewhat, especially when games start to become more CPU-bound--that's where the RTX 3070 really shines.\n\nIt can be difficult to actually find an RTX 3070 for sale, however. Nvidia has struggled to keep supply up to meet demand and said that things probably won't get easier until later in 2021. In light of the recent news from AMD about its Radeon RX 6000 series video cards, you might have more options when those cards launch later this year--and we touch on that topic a bit here.\n\nOverall, if you're still on a GTX 10 series (or GTX 9 series) video card, and have been holding out for a more significant upgrade, the RTX 3070 is one of the best options for its price and performance. If you're using an RTX 2070 (or better), you won't get that big of a benefit unless you're really itching to get better FPS in your games. Ray tracing and DLSS are becoming increasingly common so these RTX cards are more appealing now, and the 3070 makes a strong case as the one to get.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjslWYyUD1o", "date_published": "2020-10-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5: YOUR Questions Answered!  | Generation Next", "description": "We asked you for your burning questions about the PlayStation 5 and DualSense Controller, and we answer 'em in this week's Generation Next.\n\nThings are really heating up as we transition to the new generation of consoles.
