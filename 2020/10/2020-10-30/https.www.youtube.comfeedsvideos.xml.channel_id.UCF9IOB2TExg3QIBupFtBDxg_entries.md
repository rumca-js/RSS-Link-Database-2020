‘Leaked’ SAGE worst case, UK, 85,000 deaths over the winter

mid-October, there were between 43,000 and 74,000 new infections per day

In England, we are breaching the number of infections and hospital admissions in the Reasonable Worst Case planning scenario

and is almost certain to exceed this within the next two weeks

Deaths, 9 – 16 October (week 42) England and Wales

Deaths registered was 10,534

Up 580 from week 41

6.8% (669 deaths higher) than five-year average

The number would have to get to 1,200 deaths above the norm to be classified as "excess" above random expected variations

670 certificates mentioned coronavirus representing 6.4% of all deaths

An increase of 232 deaths compared with Week 41, (438 deaths or 4.4% of all deaths)

The numbers of deaths in hospitals remained below the five-year average

Deaths involving COVID-19 in hospitals, 8.4% of all hospitalised deaths

Patients currently hospitalised with COVID

Enhances innate immunity, immune peptides, anti-viral effects, disrupt viral envelopes
Suppressing the excessive expression of proinflammatory cytokines
Regulating the expression of ACE2 receptors
Epidemiological and clinical evidence, incidence, severity and mortality

Vitamin D Status in Hospitalized Patients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection 

The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (Accepted, 27th October 2020)

https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgaa733/5934827

To assess serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) levels in hospitalized patients with COVID-19

Analyze the possible influence of vitamin D status on disease severity

Retrospective

Case-control

216 COVID-19 patients

197 population-based controls

Results

Vitamin D deficiency was defined as serum 25OHD levels  less than 20 ng/ml (50 nmol/L) 

COVID patients group

Mean levels 13.8  ng/ml. (34.5 nmol/L)

82.2% vitamin D deficient 

Community control group

Mean levels 20.9 ng/ml (52.25 nmol/L) (p less than 0.0001)

47.2% vitamin D deficient

Blood levels lower in men than in women


Evidence of protective role of Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation in reducing COVID-19 deaths (Nature scientific reports, 19th October 2020)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74825-z

Ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, mediated by vitamin D synthesis

Dataset of 152 countries over 108 days (n = 6,524)

A permanent unit increase in UVI is associated with a 1.2 percentage points decline in daily growth rates of cumulative COVID-19 deaths

and a 1.0 percentage points decline in the CFR daily growth rate

Globally
Minus 12% of cumulative COVID-19 deaths

Minus 38% on CFR

We find a significant negative association between UVI and COVID-19 deaths

indicating evidence of the protective role of UVB in mitigating COVID-19 deaths

If confirmed via clinical studies, then the possibility of mitigating COVID-19 deaths via sensible sunlight exposure or vitamin D intervention would be very attractive


Vitamin D sufficiency, a serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least 30 ng/mL reduced risk for adverse clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 infection

Association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and its effect on adverse clinical outcomes

n = 235

Results

Based on CDC criteria, among our study patients, 74% had severe COVID-19 infection and 32.8% were vitamin D sufficient. 

Vitamin D sufficiency

25(OH)D less than 30 ng/ml.  (75 nmol/L)

Reduction in clinical severity

Inpatient mortality
