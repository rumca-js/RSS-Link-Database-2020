I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of New York City 1940s , buzzing with activity, with the population of Manhattan almost reaching 2 million inhabitants.
first shot is heading uptown on 8th Avenue. Madison Square Garden is on the left at 1:22, at 50th Street. 1:38 is 5th avenue, looking uptown, at 59th street. 4:55 seems to be a crosstown street, (which?) with many stooped apartment buildings, possibly midtown (Thx dvtvrich)

Video Restoration Process:
âœ” FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
âœ” Image resolution boosted up to HD 
âœ” Improved video sharpness and brightness 
âœ” Colorized only for the ambiance (not historically accurate)
âœ”added sound only for the ambiance 
âœ”restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
