I'm paying way too much for my non-functional internet. The choices I have are as follows: cut my cord and live without internet at my house or look into and install a Mo-Fi router to use 3G or 4G internet. It's just not worff it to have this expensive and useless internet as is.

This is a gource visualization. I know it doesn't matter that I told you, because people will still ask!

This visualization is actually several *months* out of date already. I uploaded it a while ago.

0:00 Readme and basic files
0:26 Scripts moved to ~/.scripts then nothing happens for a while
2:00 I start putting up videos again, increased contributors.
3:30 Scripts filed into individual directories
3:45 Vim directory utterly destroyed
4:20 Putting out more videos, more traffic and pull requests
5:52 Scripts finally moved to XDG compliant location
7:10 Switch from bash to zsh
7:52 PATH subdirectories return
9:17 Coronachan occurs and no one has anything to do but add to my dotfiles, high traffic
