It was actually Turner's second visit to The Current studio, and he's visited us a handful of other times since then. In addition to being a great songwriter and performer, Turner is also a fascinating interview. And when he's done with the session, he'll often hang around and chat longer just because he's a really nice guy and a great conversationalist. In looking back on our archives, here are three cool performances Frank Turner has done in our studio through the years.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Recovery\" (2013)\n3:35: \"Blackout\" (2018)\n7:00 \"Sister Rosetta\" (2019)\n\nPERSONNEL\nFrank Turner \u2013 vocals and guitar\nMatt Nasir \u2013 mandolin (2013 and 2018 performances)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Anna Weggel\n\nFIND MORE:\n2012 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/02/27/frank-turner-live\n2013 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/28/frank-turner-live\n2015 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/10/14/frank-turner-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2015 Guitar Collection interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/10/14/the-currents-guitar-collection-frank-turner-gibson-j45\n2018 live set during SXSW:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/03/16/frank-turner-performs-show-2141-for-the-pledgehouse-crowd-during-sxsw\n2018 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/06/22/frank-turner-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2019 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/10/21/frank-turner-solo-acoustic-no-mans-land\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#frankturner", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq2Y4K2y2F8", "date_published": "2020-10-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
