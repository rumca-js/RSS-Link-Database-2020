<p>They were the quintessential rock band, captured in their prime on a new box set. Former members recall the magic and druggy descent of Thin Lizzy – even if they can’t agree on it</p><p>If you want to see the platonic ideal of a rock band, go to YouTube and search “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Thin+Lizzy+Rainbow+1978">Thin Lizzy Rainbow 1978</a>”. You’ll find the band’s classic lineup – Phil Lynott, Brian Downey, Scott Gorham and Brian Robertson – in full flight, and even the degradation of old dubbed recordings can’t diminish their power. Gorham and Robertson flank Lynott, the trio in motion, the two guitarists criss-crossing and taking to the monitors, Lynott in the centre, bass held high, a beautiful, heavy-lidded man half seducing his audience and half assaulting it.</p><p>For a couple of years, by this point, Lizzy had been one of the most exciting rock bands around. Their studio albums had finally started matching their live reputation, and the double album Live and Dangerous – a de facto greatest hits for a band who had been a little short on actual hits – had taken their thrilling show to the people who had never seen it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/22/rise-and-fall-of-thin-lizzy-no-one-sitting-in-shadows">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Theatre Royal Bath</strong><br />Staged in a Covid-safe auditorium, this rattling revival of Harold Pinter’s mind-stretching drama is enjoyably brisk</p><p>H<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/pinter">arold Pinter</a> came to regret his frequent speech directions “pause” or “silence”, which often caused performers to stop with the lengthy solemnity of wreath-layers at the Cenotaph. So he might approve of this revival of his play getting through the text in 65 minutes, at least 10 below average. Jonathan Church’s staging of gallerista Emma’s attraction triangle with publisher husband Robert and literary agent Jerry seems to be influenced by the squash games to which the men keep challenging each other. After rattling tactical rallies, a character will smash down a big speech.</p><p>The play is staged in a Covid-safe Bath auditorium, with two thirds of seats unused but the actors permitted in-your-face kissing and embracing. When Betrayal premiered in 1978, some theatre-goers may have been shocked by the flouting of marriage vows. In 2020, tangible unease meets the breach of social distancing rules. (Don’t phone Professor Whitty – the cast is in a bubble for the run.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/22/betrayal-review-theatre-royal-bath-harold-pinter-pauses">Continue reading...</a>

But who are the best known authors behind the classics, who plied their chilling trade in the Victorian and Edwardian eras? There are the usual suspects: MR James, Charles Dickens, William Hope Hodgson, Sheridan Le Fanu, Algernon Blackwood, Wilkie Collins. But what of Mary E Wilkins Freeman? Evelyn Henty? Olive Harper? Elinor Mordaunt? Lettice Galbraith? BM Croker? </p><p>That most of us won’t recognise these names is no accident: these women ghost-story writers were effectively erased from history over the last century.

<p>This documentary about the beloved London music venue brings us sterling performers, atmospheric footage, and a sad heart</p><p>In the early 1980s, jazz club Ronnie Scott’s was facing financial ruin. “If you’d been better businessmen, this wouldn’t have happened to you,” co-founders and managers Ronnie Scott and Pete King were told. “If we’d been better businessmen we wouldn’t have opened a jazz club in the first place,” replied King.</p><p>This gentle and quietly authoritative documentary is a love letter to Scott, to the club named after him in a basement in London’s Soho in 1959, and to the music he adored. (King, apparently, was the business brains, while Scott provided the “stardust”.) Performance clips threaded throughout celebrate some of jazz’s greatest – from the opening, furiously sweat-soaked notes of Oscar Peterson at the piano, to the breathtaking skill and poise of the likes of Ella Fitzgerald, Chet Baker, Nina Simone, Cleo Laine and Buddy Rich. All graced the legendary stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/22/ronnies-review-soho-jazz-institution-ronnie-scott-pete-king">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ronnie Scott’s plays host to musical luminaries for a one-off programme highlighting the continued power of music by Nina Simone, Billie Holiday and more</p><p>‘Jazz was born out of oppression,” the pianist Ashley Henry says, from a velvet booth at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club in London. “Music was all slaves had to hang on to after they were stripped of their languages and ripped from their cultures and families – it is the universal language and it has always reflected the now.”</p><p>After six months with nearly no live music and the fraught uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic leading arts venues across the country to grasp desperately for survival, setting foot in Ronnie Scott’s is a surreal experience. Yet, this is no usual programme of events at the historic jazz club – gone are the tables in the darkened live room, replaced instead by a throng of cameras and golden lamps ready to film a series of performances. Over the next two days, UK jazz-scene luminaries such as Henry, singers Zara McFarlane and Poppy Ajudha, pianist Reuben James and cellist Ayanna Witter-Johnson will be playing civil rights and protest jazz standards for a Channel 4 Black History Month special, Sing It Loud: Black and Proud,<em> </em>presented by Maya Jama.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/22/a-tool-for-systemic-change-jazz-comes-to-channel-4-for-black-history-month">Continue reading...</a>

Boris Johnson can’t go on TV and honestly say “Christmas is cancelled, by the way”, because we’ll storm the streets until they are smeared with his blood, but he can do “it’s illegal to ever leave your postcode again” and we’ll more or less comply with it.

The suspect was a Black man, the potential victim a Black woman. </p><p>My friend was asking the group whether we thought she’d done the right thing – because her husband believed she’d called the police too quickly. It sparked a debate. Some staunchly believed that when a woman was potentially being attacked, the police should always be called. Others were worried that calling the police would only make matters worse, that my friend may have misinterpreted what she had seen, and that the police would view the man as a threat, the situation could escalate, and that he could end up being put in danger. Their preference instead would have been to speak to the man directly and see if they could calm the situation down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/22/police-black-people-trust-barrister-policing-consent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chris Woakes benefited from taking a break from the game and England’s winter schedule will test how far cricket has come</p><p>It has been 15 years since England played in Pakistan, a stretch that feels, nowadays, more than half a lifetime ago. They may go back there again in January. Wasim Khan, the chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board, has invited them out to play <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/15/england-in-talks-about-first-pakistan-tour-since-2005" title="">three Twenty20 games in the new year</a>. And given the efforts Pakistan made to help the England and Wales Cricket Board fulfil its own fixture list by touring here during lockdown in the summer, the ECB is bound to agree. The difficulty is England are also supposed to play two Tests against Sri Lanka around the same time, and have a five‑Test series against India lined up soon afterwards.</p><p>So it’s going to be a long, busy winter. And unless the ECB’s research department is about to announce some radical new advances in quantum mechanics, it may be that the only way through it is going to be for the ECB to send separate squads on simultaneous tours. It wouldn’t be the first time. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/oct/22/heaping-more-cricket-on-players-weighs-heavily-on-their-mental-wellbeing-england">Continue reading...</a>

However, according to Wizz Air’s website, I may be forced to wear one for a flight, or else denied boarding. Its conditions of carriage state that exemptions will only be made for passengers with visible signs of disability and that medical certificates will not be accepted. Is this legal?<br /></strong><em><strong>TT, London</strong></em></p><p>This appears to fly in the face of the Equality Act which makes clear that not all disabilities are visible. Indeed, the majority are not. However, the act does not apply to aviation. Instead, the prevailing rules are provided by EU Regulation (EC) 1107/2006 which states that passengers with disabilities should have “opportunities for travel comparable to other citizens”. It adds, however, that airlines must verify whether a passenger should be denied boarding on safety grounds. It’s this caveat that Wizz Air is presumably relying on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/oct/22/is-wizz-air-flying-in-the-face-of-the-equality-act-over-face-masks">Continue reading...</a>

I certainly did for the 21 years I battled with my periods every month, only to be advised to try strong painkillers and various contraceptive pills, with sympathetic smiles from GPs.

Even then, my guess-diagnosis came via a mate who happened to be an obstetrician, not from a doctor I had sought out. I say guess-diagnosis as I have a condition that can only be formally diagnosed via keyhole surgery. As I sat slumped to one side during a breakfast out one day – she inquired why I wasn’t sitting upright.<strong> </strong>I told her I never can on day one of my period, how my bone-deep pain feels like it’s dragging me slowly to the floor.

Pretty soon it also acquired a social sense of rank, which persists when people worry that inequalities in healthcare, say, might lead to a “two-tier system”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/22/were-all-in-tiers-the-meaning-behind-the-latest-covid-19-buzzword">Continue reading...</a>

The public housing development would later become notorious as the site where Black Panther co-founder Huey Newton was killed in 1989, but for Armstrong’s mother, it was where she sent her three children for safekeeping as crack began menacing the city and violent crime was on the rise.</p><p>One morning while Armstrong sat around the TV with his siblings and cousins, Oakland police officers kicked in the door, guns drawn. They had a warrant for Armstrong’s uncle, who was allegedly involved in the drug trade. They pointed their weapons at the children, then proceeded to ransack the home, flipping over furniture and ripping the stuffing from the bottom of couches. Armstrong recalls the officers “going into cabinets and pouring cereal out”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/22/black-or-blue-the-complex-double-lives-of-oaklands-black-police-officers">Continue reading...</a>

A few days later, his father dropped dead right in front of him. “I saw how he looked,” says McLean. “He’d turned green. I didn’t know what I was going to do without him. He was the king, the boss. He knew everything.”</p><p>The singer-songwriter behind the 1971 classic American Pie is speaking from his home in Palm Desert, a town in California where he is now well into what he calls the “desert phase” of his life. Wildfires are still burning across the state. You can’t see the sun for the acrid smoke. “I’m feeling it in my lungs,” says the 75-year-old.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/22/don-mclean-american-pie-its-meaning-family-deaths-tragedy-60s">Continue reading...</a>

## Margaret Busby: how Britain's first black female publisher revolutionised literature – and never gave up

<p>In her 20s, she set up her own company, publishing everyone from James Ellroy to the Worst Witch series, and changing Britain for the better, book by book </p><p>There is a revealing story Margaret Busby tells, about the first novel she published. A family friend had bumped into a former US serviceman called Sam Greenlee. Greenlee said he had written a novel, rejected by 40 American publishers, a satirical thriller about the first African American man hired by the CIA but given a very visible non-job (the point being it was only to improve the CIA’s image). The man keeps his head down, learns about guerrilla warfare, then quits to become a freedom fighter in Chicago. Busby took it on, borrowing money so Greenlee could stay in London while the book was edited and, when it was about to be published, in 1969, she sent it to the Observer.</p><p>The paper refused it – it didn’t extract fiction and certainly not black power novels. Busby sent it back, insisting the paper was wrong. It ran an extract, and The Spook Who Sat By the Door was translated into six languages and turned into a film. When this “parable of institutional racism”, as the New York Times described the film, opened in 1973, newspapers wondered if it would start race warfare. It closed early under FBI pressure, and was not reissued until 2004, then, nearly a decade later, added to the Library of Congress’s National Film Registry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/oct/22/margaret-busby-the-uks-first-black-female-publisher-everyone-assumed-i-was-there-to-make-the-tea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the 1930s, thousands of men and women around the world enlisted to fight fascism in Spain. Many survivors went on to play a key role in the fight against the Nazis – but, in some cases, later became powerful servants of brutal regimes<br /></p><p>Virgilio Fernández del Real sent his last testament via WhatsApp on 28 November 2019. I opened the video to see him propped up in bed at his colonial-era haçienda in Guanajuato, Mexico. Bloodshot eyes peered out above a rampant white beard. A big red, gold and purple flag, representing Spain’s short-lived republican democracy from the 1930s, was spread out behind him. “My birthday is on 26 December, when I will be 101,” he wheezed in Spanish, though he clearly did not believe he would make it. “I still have the strength to say: <em>‘¡Viva la República Española!’”</em></p><p>Nine days before that birthday, his wife, Estela, sent another message: “Fifteen minutes ago, Virgilio went on his journey to the Father’s house, transcending into the infinite. He is no longer suffering.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/oct/22/the-contested-legacy-of-the-anti-fascist-international-brigades">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Veteran epidemiologist calls for review, and openness to adopting measures suggested by political rivals, now that voters have given PM a mandate</p><p>Jacinda Ardern won New Zealand’s election with a commanding majority, in part attributed to her handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in her country. But a veteran epidemiologist is exhorting the prime minister to use the political capital gained in her decisive victory to scrutinise the coronavirus response by her government and officials, and adopt strategies proposed by her opponents before Saturday’s vote.</p><p>“New Zealand has shown it can be quite smart and flexible, but we can see we’ve got these blind spots and we need to have no blind spots,” said Nick Wilson, a University of Otago epidemiologist. “This is such an unforgiving disease and very few countries are doing it right so we need to smarten up our act quite substantially.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/22/ardern-urged-to-review-covid-measures-after-election-landslide">Continue reading...</a>

Emotions have often run high. Even as the curtain is about to come down on proceedings with a ruling on if those convicted will be jailed before an appeal can be heard, the Greek judge, both laconic and low-key, has had to pull off an extraordinary balancing act presiding over a case that has put more Nazi leaders and sympathisers in the dock than at any time since Nuremberg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/22/the-women-who-brought-down-greeces-golden-dawn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian US data editor, Mona Chalabi, casts a sceptical eye over the US polling industry that is once again predicting defeat for Donald Trump. Has it learned lessons from 2016?</p><p>The election of Donald Trump in 2016 came as a hammer-blow not just for Hillary Clinton and the Democratic party but also for the opinion polling industry. While they had correctly predicted her majority in the popular vote, they had catastrophically missed the bigger story: Trump had won in the key swing states to clinch the presidency via the electoral college. </p><p>The Guardian’s US data editor, <strong>Mona Chalabi, </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that following 2016, the pollsters tweaked their models as they ate humble pie, but this year they are back to projecting the results with similar confidence: and once again they are predicting a defeat for Donald Trump. But have those trends they missed in 2016 been properly accounted for? And should parts of the media be far more sceptical than they currently are about the scientific-sounding claims of the major polling sites?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/22/us-election-2020-can-we-trust-the-polls-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
