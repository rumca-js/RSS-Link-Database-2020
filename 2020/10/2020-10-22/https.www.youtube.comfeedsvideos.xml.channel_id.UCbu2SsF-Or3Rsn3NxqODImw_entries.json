Here are the best moments from the stream.\n\nCongresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Among Us stream was one of the most successful broadcasts in the history of Twitch, pulling in over 430,000 viewers on her channel alone. If you weren't able to tune into the 3.5 hour event or haven't found the time to watch the VOD over on Twitch, fear not: we've clipped out some of the best moments from AOC's Among Us stream in this highlight reel.\n\nThe laughs start almost immediately when AOC, terrified of playing as the impostor, ends up getting impostor in her first match. But despite some hesitation, she manages to take out Poki, who later referred to the betrayal as an \"honor.\"\n\nAmong Us is a deception game, so lying, backstabbing, and other drama is expected, but with AOC, fellow congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and tons of notable streamers as crewmates, it was all in good fun.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=By5LL4O00nE", "date_published": "2020-10-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "First Look At Tom Holland As Nathan Drake | Save State", "description": "On today's Save State, Persia talks about our first look at Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, DMC 5 performance modes coming to the next-gen special edition, and Kojima Productions starting its next game.\n\nIn this video, Persia talks about our first look at Tom Holland as Nathan Drake in the upcoming Uncharted movie. The costume design got the approval of Naughty Dog's Kurt Margenau and Nathan Drake voice actor Nolan North. Filming just started this past July but is already almost complete. The film is expected to hit the theaters on July 16, 2021.\n\nPersia also talks about the new DMC 5 performance modes coming to the next-gen special edition of the game. The four new modes have various combinations that vary between 4k and 1080p, ray tracing, and framerate. Ray tracing isn't coming to the Series X version of the game on day one, but it will be patched in at a later date. DMC 5 Special Edition comes to Series X and S on November 10, and to PS5 on November 12.\n\nLastly, Persia talks about the confirmation of Kojima Productions starting its next game. There aren't any details on the new game or if it ties into Death Stranding in any way. The studio is now hiring for multiple roles in game programming and design, sound design, art, writing, production, management, and localization, with fluency in Japanese being required for all roles.\n\nThis is your Save State for Thursday, October 22nd.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMcBn5Ez4AU", "date_published": "2020-10-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Greg Miller And Andrea Rene Crush The Immortals Fenyx Rising Stadia Demo", "description": "(Presented by Ubisoft and Stadia) We teamed up with Greg Miller from Kinda Funny Games and Andrea Rene from What's Good Games to take us through the exclusive free demo of Immortals Fenyx Rising.

Here are some tips to get you started.\n\nGhost-hunting horror game Phasmophobia is rapidly gaining attention, and with Halloween just around the corner, it's a great option if you're looking to get spooked with some friends. As it's still in early access, it has its fair share of jankiness, but that's part of the fun. The only downside is that the tutorial is rather unhelpful (and that's putting it generously). \n\nIn this video, Jake Dekker gives you a proper tutorial to hunting ghosties in Phasmophobia. He runs down what the actual goal of the game is--to identify what kind of ghost you're dealing with--and then all the tools you'll need and how to use them. This includes the EMF reader, the tricky-to-use spirit box, and the all-important thermometer. \n\nJake also explains some of the optional tools at your disposal, including the crucifix (which works as expected, in a the-power-of-Christ-compels-you sort of way), smudge sticks for saging a haunted room, and more. If you're trying to get into Phasmophobia but having a hard time navigating its learning curve, he's got you covered.\n\nWe recently named Phasmophobia one or our best horror games to play for Halloween.

Questions such as how big its open world is, if you can purchase different apartments around Night City, and how its vehicle and melee combat feels.\n\nWe asked our YouTube subscribers for their burning questions about the game, and there were hundreds to go through. To answer these questions, Lucy James is joined by Cyberpunk lore master Jean-Luc Seipke, and Jake Dekker, who has actually played a number of hours of the game. \n\nThey both write and host a series on the lore of Cyberpunk, which is also well worth checking out if you're interested in the world that 2077 takes place in. Cyberpunk 2077 launches on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia on November 19, and will be playable on Xbox Series X/S and PS5.

This includes the game's character creator, prologue, introduction to the hub, and quest to save Aphrodite by reuniting the goddess of love with her true essence.\n\nIn the video above, we focus on those first two, showcasing how Immortals begins. If you're at all interested in checking out the game for yourself, Ubisoft has released a free demo on Google Stadia. All you need is a Gmail account.\n\nIn the opening sections of Immortals, protagonist Fenyx washes up on the shore of the Golden Isle. They learn that they're the last living mortal from their crew--the rest, including their older brother, have been turned to stone. In order to save their fellow humans, Fenyx decides to enlist the help of the gods. But they soon learn that Zeus and his family are in more trouble than they are. \n\nIf you think the opening of Immortals looks a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild--good eye! Both games have similar starts. Like Link in Breath of the Wild, Fenyx is initially constricted to a small area where you learn the basic movement and exploration mechanics and also acquire the standard powers and abilities for your adventure, including a means of gliding through the air. With the ability to fly, Fenyx is able to reach the main, much larger area of the game. Upon landing, Fenyx's adventure truly begins.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMk2RT5zV_o", "date_published": "2020-10-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New Suits For Spider-Man: Miles Morales Revealed | Save State", "description": "More Spidey suits for PS5's Spider-Man: Miles Morales have been revealed, AOC's Among Us stream was one of the biggest Twitch streams ever, and could another Ghost of Tsushima be coming?
