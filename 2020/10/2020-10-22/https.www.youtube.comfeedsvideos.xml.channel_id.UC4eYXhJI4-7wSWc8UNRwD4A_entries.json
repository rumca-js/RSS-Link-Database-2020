Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nOctober 23, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- The setlist for Spillage Village's Tiny Desk (home) concert reminds me of the bouts of pessimism and jolts of optimism I've had of late. Opening with the dreary, apocalyptic \"End of Daze,\" leaping into titles like \"Hapi\" and \"Jupiter,\" feels all too applicable in 2020.\n\nThe Atlanta collective consists of Dreamville records standouts J.I.D and EARTHGANG along with Jurdan Bryant, Hollywood JB, Benji and Tiny Desk alumnus Mereba. R&B star 6lack, also a member of the group, was unable to make it to the shoot due to travel restrictions. Spillage Village began working on its latest album, Spilligion, in direct response to the unpredictable chaos the world has faced since March. J.I.D told Rolling Stone that he originally rented a house to begin recording his third solo album with collaborations, but that the heavy topics of the pandemic and social justice led to music that was bigger than any one artist.\n\nThe underlying theme throughout Spilligion is spirituality, so when they floated the idea of filming in a church I knew that if they couldn't perform behind the desk, this was the perfect alternative.\n\nSET LIST\n\"End of Daze\"\n\"Baptize\"\n\"Hapi\"\n\"Jupiter\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nHollywood JB: vocals\nJurdan Bryant: vocals\nBenji.: vocals, bass\nOLU (EARTHGANG): vocals, guitar\nMereba: vocals\nJ.I.D.: vocals\nWowGr8 (EARTHGANG): vocals\nChristo: DJ\nJustin Barnett: guitar\nJerramy Barnett: bass\nNick Barnett: guitar\nDj Barnett: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideographers: Mac Grant and Chad Tennies\nAudio Engineers: Mac Grant, Mixed by Ali, Chad Tennies and Josh Rogosin\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_76wT1NMgUY", "date_published": "2020-10-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Outsmarting The Devil: Mac Phipps (Pt 3) | Louder Than A Riot, S1E4", "description": "Exploitation of prisoners. Sexual assault allegations. A Supreme Court ruling that could hold the keys to freedom. In the third and final installment of Mac's story, we follow the ripples of Mac's case two decades after the verdict was handed down. What do the roadblocks in Mac's fight for exoneration say about liberty and justice for all? And how does his imprisonment affect the loved ones he's left behind?\n\nARTWORK by Dale Edwin Murray / MUSIC by Kassa Overall / VIDEO by Renee Klahr\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nWHAT'S \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"?\nRhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. \"Louder Than A Riot\" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles \u2014 the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts, questions and feedback.
