I now have it and a terabyte SSD. Some MSATA drives can actually be as large as a TB, but this one was \"only\" 256 GB. I plan on moving my operating system over to it and perhaps my backup of the Monero blockchain.\n\nThe ThinkPad X220 was the first of the X series ThinkPads to have an MSATA slot. While I like the X200, I don't believe any of them came with it.\n\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\nDONATE: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://brave.com/luk005 Get the Brave browser.\nhttps://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke View my videos on LBRY.
