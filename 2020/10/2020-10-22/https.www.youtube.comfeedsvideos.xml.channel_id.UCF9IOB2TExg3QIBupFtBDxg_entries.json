moderate covid-19 in adults in India: open label phase II multicentre randomised controlled trial (PLACID Trial) (BMJ, 12th October)\n\nhttps://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3939\n\nIndia, 39 public and private hospitals\n\n464 adults admitted with confirmed moderate covid-19\n\nRespiratory rate, more than 24/min\n\nOxygen saturation 93% or less on room air\n\nRandomisation sequence\n\nConvalescent plasma group (Intervention group)\n\nn = 235 \n\nBest standard of care (Control group)\n\nn =  229 \n\nIntervention group\n\nReceived two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma\n\nDetectable neutralising antibodies\n\nOutcome measure\n\nProgression to severe disease \n\nAll cause mortality at 28 days\n\nTime to symptom resolution\n\nIntervention group\n\nProgression to severe disease death, 44 (19%)\n\nMortality within 28 days, 34 participants (15%)\n\nProgression to severe disease, 17\n\nControl group\n\nProgression to severe disease death, 41 (18%)\n\nMortality

a reduction in progression to severe covid-19\n\nor all cause mortality\n\nHigh generalisability\n\napproximates convalescent plasma use in real life settings\n\nProfessor Ian Jones, virology, Reading University\n\nThe poor performance of convalescent plasma in this trial is disappointing but not entirely surprising\n\nPlasma is more likely to work if given very early\n\nResearchers should to continue to conduct trials\nbut to do so in newly diagnosed patients.\n\nWe still do not have enough treatments for the early stage of disease to prevent severe disease and until this becomes an option, avoiding being infected with the virus remains the key message\n\nImplications\nMAB therapy\nLong term immunity\nVaccination\n\nIf you would like to donate to John's educational projects,
