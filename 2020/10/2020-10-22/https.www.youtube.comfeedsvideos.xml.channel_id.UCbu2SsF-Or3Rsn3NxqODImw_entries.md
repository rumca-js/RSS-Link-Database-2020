AOC logged on to play Among Us alongside Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and several other popular streamers. Here are the best moments from the stream.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Among Us stream was one of the most successful broadcasts in the history of Twitch, pulling in over 430,000 viewers on her channel alone. If you weren't able to tune into the 3.5 hour event or haven't found the time to watch the VOD over on Twitch, fear not: we've clipped out some of the best moments from AOC's Among Us stream in this highlight reel.

The laughs start almost immediately when AOC, terrified of playing as the impostor, ends up getting impostor in her first match. But despite some hesitation, she manages to take out Poki, who later referred to the betrayal as an "honor."

Among Us is a deception game, so lying, backstabbing, and other drama is expected, but with AOC, fellow congresswoman Ilhan Omar, and tons of notable streamers as crewmates, it was all in good fun.

On today's Save State, Persia talks about our first look at Tom Holland as Nathan Drake, DMC 5 performance modes coming to the next-gen special edition, and Kojima Productions starting its next game.

In this video, Persia talks about our first look at Tom Holland as Nathan Drake in the upcoming Uncharted movie. The costume design got the approval of Naughty Dog's Kurt Margenau and Nathan Drake voice actor Nolan North. Filming just started this past July but is already almost complete. The film is expected to hit the theaters on July 16, 2021.

Persia also talks about the new DMC 5 performance modes coming to the next-gen special edition of the game. The four new modes have various combinations that vary between 4k and 1080p, ray tracing, and framerate. Ray tracing isn't coming to the Series X version of the game on day one, but it will be patched in at a later date. DMC 5 Special Edition comes to Series X and S on November 10, and to PS5 on November 12.

Lastly, Persia talks about the confirmation of Kojima Productions starting its next game. There aren't any details on the new game or if it ties into Death Stranding in any way. The studio is now hiring for multiple roles in game programming and design, sound design, art, writing, production, management, and localization, with fluency in Japanese being required for all roles.

This is your Save State for Thursday, October 22nd.

## Phasmophobia - The Ultimate Beginner's Guide

Phasmophobiaâ€™s goal is simple, though achieving it is a little tricky. Here are some tips to get you started.

Ghost-hunting horror game Phasmophobia is rapidly gaining attention, and with Halloween just around the corner, it's a great option if you're looking to get spooked with some friends. As it's still in early access, it has its fair share of jankiness, but that's part of the fun. The only downside is that the tutorial is rather unhelpful (and that's putting it generously). 

In this video, Jake Dekker gives you a proper tutorial to hunting ghosties in Phasmophobia. He runs down what the actual goal of the game is--to identify what kind of ghost you're dealing with--and then all the tools you'll need and how to use them. This includes the EMF reader, the tricky-to-use spirit box, and the all-important thermometer. 

Jake also explains some of the optional tools at your disposal, including the crucifix (which works as expected, in a the-power-of-Christ-compels-you sort of way), smudge sticks for saging a haunted room, and more. If you're trying to get into Phasmophobia but having a hard time navigating its learning curve, he's got you covered.

We recently named Phasmophobia one or our best horror games to play for Halloween. You can also see our list of the best horror anime you can stream right now if you're looking for even more ways to get scared.

We asked you for your burning questions about Cyberpunk 2077. You asked about its map, vehicles, how long to beat the game, and more, and we've got answers. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is launching very soon, and despite numerous Night City Wire presentations, there are still plenty of questions surrounding the game. Questions such as how big its open world is, if you can purchase different apartments around Night City, and how its vehicle and melee combat feels.

We asked our YouTube subscribers for their burning questions about the game, and there were hundreds to go through. To answer these questions, Lucy James is joined by Cyberpunk lore master Jean-Luc Seipke, and Jake Dekker, who has actually played a number of hours of the game.

Cyberpunk 2077 launches on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia on November 19, and will be playable on Xbox Series X/S and PS5.

## Immortals Fenyx Rising: First 20 Minutes of Gameplay

We explore the world and gain new abilities and weapons in the first 20 minutes of Immortals Fenyx Rising.

Ahead of the release of Immortals Fenyx Rising, we had the chance to play the opening four hours of the game. This includes the game's character creator, prologue, introduction to the hub, and quest to save Aphrodite by reuniting the goddess of love with her true essence.

In the video above, we focus on those first two, showcasing how Immortals begins. If you're at all interested in checking out the game for yourself, Ubisoft has released a free demo on Google Stadia. All you need is a Gmail account.

In the opening sections of Immortals, protagonist Fenyx washes up on the shore of the Golden Isle. They learn that they're the last living mortal from their crew--the rest, including their older brother, have been turned to stone. In order to save their fellow humans, Fenyx decides to enlist the help of the gods. But they soon learn that Zeus and his family are in more trouble than they are. 

If you think the opening of Immortals looks a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild--good eye! Both games have similar starts. Like Link in Breath of the Wild, Fenyx is initially constricted to a small area where you learn the basic movement and exploration mechanics and also acquire the standard powers and abilities for your adventure, including a means of gliding through the air. With the ability to fly, Fenyx is able to reach the main, much larger area of the game. Upon landing, Fenyx's adventure truly begins.

More Spidey suits for PS5's Spider-Man: Miles Morales have been revealed, AOC's Among Us stream was one of the biggest Twitch streams ever, and could another Ghost of Tsushima be coming? Lucy's got the biggest news stories of the day. 

Insomniac Games has revealed more suits for the upcoming PS5 launch game, Spider-Man: Miles Morales. First up is the Crimson Cowl Suit, as well as Miles' famous T.R.A.C.K. Suit, which is a preorder bonus, but is also unlockable in-game. 

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez streamed Among Us on Twitch with streamers such as Jacksepticeye, Pokimane, and fellow US House Representative Ilhan Omar. It was one of the biggest Twitch streams ever, maxing at 430,000 concurrent viewers on AOC's page. 

Ghost of Tsushima developer Sucker Punch is staffing up. A job listing is looking for a narrative writer with experience in feudal Japan, but it's unknown if it's for Ghost of Tsushima DLC or for a sequel. Ghost of Tsushima will be playable on the PS5 via backwards compatibility, and it'll run at 60 FPS.

Whether itâ€™s PS Plus, PS Now, or Game Pass, thereâ€™s a lot of options for what we play and how we play it, but whatâ€™s the best for you? Hereâ€™s the ultimate guide to understanding what each service has to offer.

There is no better time than now to be a gamer, and thatâ€™s simply because we have a lot of options for what we play and how we play it.

But with options, comes the need to make decisions, and to make decisions you need to be as informed as possible on questions like what is the PlayStation Plus Collection? Or PS Now? Is it like Xbox Game Pass? Are they the same and what service is right for my gaming needs?Â 

PS Now offers the ability to stream over 700 games, 400 of which are downloadable, and thankfully Bloodborne is available for both options. But what about The Last Of Us? You may be surprised to know itâ€™s only streamable. In comparison to PS Nowâ€™s huge library, Game Pass has a little over a 100 games, but does more games mean itâ€™s better for you?

In this video, Kurt Indovina goes through what each service is, what they cost, and exactly what it is they offer. He also lists details some of the hottest games for each service, and compares what games are available on both PS Plus Collection and Game Pass, like Batman: Arkham Knight, Resident Evil 7, and more.Â
