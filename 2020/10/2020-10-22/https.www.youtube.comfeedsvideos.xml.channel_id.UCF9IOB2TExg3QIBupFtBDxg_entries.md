Convalescent plasma in the management of moderate covid-19 in adults in India: open label phase II multicentre randomised controlled trial (PLACID Trial) (BMJ, 12th October)

https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m3939

India, 39 public and private hospitals

464 adults admitted with confirmed moderate covid-19

Respiratory rate, more than 24/min

Oxygen saturation 93% or less on room air

Randomisation sequence

Convalescent plasma group (Intervention group)

n = 235 

Best standard of care (Control group)

n =  229 

Intervention group

Received two doses of 200 mL convalescent plasma

Detectable neutralising antibodies

Outcome measure

Progression to severe disease 

All cause mortality at 28 days

Time to symptom resolution

Intervention group

Progression to severe disease death, 44 (19%)

Mortality within 28 days, 34 participants (15%)

Progression to severe disease, 17

Control group

Progression to severe disease death, 41 (18%)

Mortality within 28 days, 31 participants (14%)

Progression to severe disease, 17

Other things the same

Duration of respiratory support

Proportion of receiving invasive ventilation,

Resolution of fever and cough

Oxygen requirement

Organ failure assessment

WHO scale scores for clinical improvement

Average levels of inflammatory markers

Lactate

C reactive protein 

D-dimer 

Neutralising antibody titres in plasma recipients did not correlate with clinical outcomes

Better in the intervention group

Resolution of shortness of breath and
fatigue at day 7

Patients testing antigen negative at day 7

Also

Among the 38 who received invasive ventilation, only two survived until 28 days

Conclusion

Convalescent plasma was not associated with a reduction in progression to severe covid-19

or all cause mortality

High generalisability

approximates convalescent plasma use in real life settings

Professor Ian Jones, virology, Reading University

The poor performance of convalescent plasma in this trial is disappointing but not entirely surprising

Plasma is more likely to work if given very early

Researchers should to continue to conduct trials
but to do so in newly diagnosed patients.

We still do not have enough treatments for the early stage of disease to prevent severe disease and until this becomes an option, avoiding being infected with the virus remains the key message

Implications
MAB therapy
Long term immunity
Vaccination

Deaths, 220,362

Dr. Jay Butler, (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

distressing trend

increasing in nearly 75 percent of the country

This past week, we've seen nearly 60,000 cases a day on average, as well as 700 deaths

Past 2 weeks

Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin

Cooler weather that is forcing people indoors

Smaller, more intimate gatherings with family, friends and neighbors may be driving infections

Excess Deaths From COVID-19 and Other Causes, March-July 2020 (12th October)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771761

March 1 and August 1, 2020

Deaths, 1, 336, 561

20% increase over expected

Highest per capita

New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Arizona, Mississippi, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Michigan

States that reopened earlier experienced more protracted increases in excess deaths

Of 225, 530 excess deaths, 150 541 (67%) were attributed to COVID-19

Two other causes reached statistical significance

Heart disease 

Alzheimer disease/dementia

Important message as weather gets colder

Close contact, six feet and 15 minutes, operational definition for contact tracing

Cumulative exposures can be as hazardous as 15 sustained continuous minutes of exposure

Importance of wearing face masks to prevent transmission

The more time you spend with someone, the more likely you are to get infected
