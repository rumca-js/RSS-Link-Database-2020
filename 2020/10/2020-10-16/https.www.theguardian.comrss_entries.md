<p>Racehorse owner and founder of Chrysalis Records has high hopes for Wonderful Tonight on Champions Day</p><p>More than half a century after he founded Chrysalis Records and almost 40 years after he bought his first racehorse, Chris Wright can see at least one parallel between the music industry and the sport of kings.</p><p>“There is one thing which is incredibly similar,” he said on Friday, “and it’s why I think racing is a reasonably natural fit for someone like me. In the music business, you go out of your way to sign artists you think have got the talent and ability to make it, and some of them are expensive to sign and some are not so expensive. You might see a group in a pub that no one else has seen, and you might sign them for less money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/16/unearthing-talent-is-key-for-chris-wright-in-music-and-racing">Continue reading...</a>

That was the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/17/everton-liverpool-premier-league" title="">opening line of the Guardian’s report</a> on the first match John W Henry attended as Liverpool’s owner, a 2-0 defeat at Goodison Park that left his new investment second from bottom of the Premier League 10 years ago on Saturday.</p><p>The big picture can change drastically over a decade, clearly.

<p>The Marvelous Mrs Maisel’s Rachel Brosnahan impresses as a housewife forced on the run in a crime saga that sadly can’t deliver on the promise of a blistering first half</p><p>There’s an odd startle to the opening scene of the 70s-set Amazon thriller I’m Your Woman, as a lounging housewife is met with an unusual surprise. Jean (The Marvelous Mrs Maisel’s Emmy magnet Rachel Brosnahan) has accepted a lonely life of waiting; for a husband to come home from work, for a domestic adeptness to finally arrive and for a pregnancy to one day turn into a birth. When Eddie (Bill Heck) returns that day, he’s holding a baby which he spookily tells Jean is now hers. She’s understandably confused but also resigned to never quite knowing what’s behind the curtain, married to a criminal whose exploits are forever in the dark.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/10/french-exit-review-michelle-pfeiffer">French Exit review – Michelle Pfeiffer can't save disastrous sinking souffle</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/16/im-your-woman-review-70s-thriller-goes-from-marvelous-to-middling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Just over 10 years ago they had never featured in the top division but now Rob Baxter’s side are preparing for a Champions Cup final against Racing 92</p><p>Most of the best upwardly mobile stories in British professional team sport have been football yarns. Wimbledon’s Crazy Gang, Brian Clough’s Nottingham Forest, Sir Alex Ferguson’s Aberdeen: all were character-heavy outsiders who confounded their more fancied rivals. More recently there has been Leicester City, winners of the 2015-16 Premier League having played in the third tier only seven years earlier.</p><p>None of the above, though, can outdo the improbable journey of Exeter RFC from the edge of nowhere to the European Champions Cup final. If that sounds a bold claim, consider the evidence. Just over 10 years ago the fun-loving Chiefs were still a Championship team and had never featured in the country’s top division. They are not bankrolled by billionaire overseas owners, still rely on homegrown West Country talent and sundry cast-offs and even have a director of rugby, Rob Baxter, who could, if asked, shear a sheep on the Ashton Gate pitch before kick-off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/16/inside-exeter-how-chiefs-have-risen-to-brink-of-euro-glory-champions-cup-final-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

Photographer of working-class life during the decline of industry in north-east England<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/14/chris-killip-hard-hitting-photographer-of-britains-working-class-dies-aged-74" title="">Chris Killip</a>, who has died aged 74 from lung cancer, was one of Britain’s greatest documentary photographers. His most compelling work was made in the north-east of England in the late 1970s and early 80s and was rooted in the relationship of people to the places that made – and often unmade – them as the traditional jobs they relied on disappeared. In 1988 he published <a href="https://www.bjp-online.com/2017/06/now-then-chris-killip-and-the-making-of-in-flagrante/" title="">In Flagrante</a>, a landmark of social documentary that has influenced generations of younger photographers. His friend and fellow photographer Martin Parr described it as “the best book about Britain since the war”.</p><p>Killip later said that he had unknowingly photographed the “de-industrialisation” of the north-east. He had set out to render meaningful the lives of those who had been marginalised by the end of traditional industry in the region – miners, shipbuilders, fishermen and the like – and he did so through acute observation and empathy. “In recording their lives, I’m valuing their lives,” he said later of his mainly unemployed subjects. “These people will not appear in history books because ordinary people don’t. History is done to them. It is not acknowledged that they make history.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/16/chris-killip-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Without trust, societies are vulnerable to forces that will pull them apart just when they should be at their most united</p><p>Boris Johnson this week attempted to palm off responsibility for imposing unpopular lockdowns to curb the spread of Covid-19 on to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/15/no-agreement-on-manchester-and-lancashire-lockdown-says-hancock" title="">northern English politicians</a>, without adequate compensation.

Controlling the pandemic needs the public to have faith in the authorities and each other.</p><p>Having won power as a populist, maybe Mr Johnson thinks there is political advantage in chaos. But the prime minister cannot afford to lose support in the former “red wall” of traditional Labour seats that voted Conservative in last year’s election.

## One person hoping Donald Trump wins: Boris Johnson | Jonathan Freedland

<p>If Joe Biden becomes the next US president, that will be good news for Labour in the UK, and spell trouble for the government<br /></p><p>To contemplate the impact of Donald Trump losing next month, it helps to imagine him winning. The impact on the United States of a second Trump term would be transformative, of course, but I’m thinking of the effect on the wider world and, in particular, on the politics of Britain. So picture, for just a moment, what a second against-the-odds Trump win would mean for this country.</p><p>A Tory party that has made Brexit its defining mission – and insists it views a no-deal crash-out from the EU “<a href="https://twitter.com/Brexit/status/1317061860701687811?s=20">with high hearts and </a><a href="https://twitter.com/Brexit/status/1317061860701687811?s=20">complete confidence</a><a href="https://twitter.com/Brexit/status/1317061860701687811?s=20">”</a>, as Boris Johnson put it today – would be boosted by the message that populist nationalism was not a 2016 aberration but rather a global movement with enough juice to endure into the mid-2020s. The Illiberal International embodied by Viktor Orbán, Jair Bolsonaro and Vladimir Putin would draw strength from an unexpected victory for its most senior member; and, although Johnson does not like to put himself in that company, he and his Brexit government would be lifted by US confirmation that the spirit of the age is not international co-operation but a world of competing states, each dedicated to making itself great again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/16/donald-trump-boris-johnson-joe-biden-us-president-labour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite the hardline rhetoric, a trade agreement is still possible – and the prime minister wants one</p><p>So the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/16/boris-johnson-tells-uk-prepare-for-a-no-deal-brexit">prime </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/16/boris-johnson-tells-uk-prepare-for-a-no-deal-brexit">minister has spoken</a>. And as a result, we have a standoff. While Boris Johnson demanded a “fundamental change of approach” from the EU, the 27 heads of state and government, for their part, on Friday <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/16/merkel-urges-johnson-not-to-abandon-brexit-negotiations">called on the </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/16/merkel-urges-johnson-not-to-abandon-brexit-negotiations">UK</a> “to make the necessary moves to make an agreement possible”.</p><p>There were, of course, the usual half-truths. For the record, the UK has been asking for significantly more than a Canada-style relationship, including visa-free travel for short business trips and mutual recognition of qualifications. The EU has been clear for some time that the UK’s size and proximity would necessitate safeguards that weren’t felt to be needed for the Canadians. And Australia has a number of agreements in place with the EU and is seeking a free-trade agreement to improve on World Trade Organization terms. So neither analogy is particularly accurate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/16/boris-johnsons-tough-talk-on-a-no-deal-brexit-may-not-be-all-it-seems">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She is set to reprise her role as the prime minister in a new series of the hit Scandi drama, but the actor is just as excited to share the limelight in David Hare’s new BBC thriller, Roadkill</p><p>Sidse Babett Knudsen had an ulterior motive for joining the cast of BBC One’s new political thriller <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08tfrq3">Roadkill</a>, playing the mistress of Hugh Laurie’s ambitious Conservative minister. Sure, she is a fan of Roadkill’s writer, David Hare (whom she describes as “one of the gods”); in her theatre group days, she would regularly make the trip from Copenhagen to London to see his plays at the Royal Court. But that’s far from the whole story. “One of my favourite shows of all time is Veep, and Selina Meyer’s obsession with Hugh Laurie’s character is one of the funniest things I’ve ever seen,” she says. “I thought if I could get a photo in bed with him and send it to her that could be so funny!”</p><p>It’s the kind of cunning plot that would certainly be beneath the dignity of Knudsen’s most famous character, Danish PM Birgitte Nyborg, in the soon-to-be revived drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/borgen">Borgen</a>. In any case, she confesses, the <em>kompromat</em> was never obtained. “I never really got around to do it.

<p>With his ever-evolving ‘plans’, Boris Johnson has succeeded in alienating even those who were once his biggest fans</p><p>I hate to stray into superforecasting, but I wonder whether Boris Johnson’s wheeze of dividing the UK into a number of bitterly resentful regions will feel worth it in the end? He has created a sort of Covid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire">Westeros</a>, where local warlords rail and scheme against him, as do some of his own courtiers. Johnson, the body-positive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joffrey_Baratheon">Joffrey</a>, rules by whim and weakness, convinced of a genius middle way that far more brilliant epidemiologists and economists insist simply does not exist. Even northern Tory MPs are saluting the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/16/andy-burnham-trying-to-hold-us-over-a-barrel-on-tier-3-covid-lockdown-says-raab">Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham</a>, for whom it hopefully won’t all go a bit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Stark">Robb Stark</a>. Otherwise, unity hopes are pinned on the Rashford 2036 election ticket.</p><p>In the meantime, it’s such an intriguing strategy to deliberately sow divisions. Or tiers, as Johnson prefers to euphemise them. No wonder half his party wants to tier him a new one over it. Consider Jake Berry, once such a rabid Johnson fan that when Michael Gove torpedoed Bojo’s 2016 leadership bid, <a href="https://www.rossendalefreepress.co.uk/news/mp-stands-tweet-saying-gove-11555068">Berry thundered of Gove</a>: “There is a very deep pit reserved in hell for such as he.” On Thursday night, Berry’s warning shot was fired in quite a different direction.

## Star Trek: Discovery season three review – its most thoughtful series yet

<p>Opening on a broken world where hope seems to be the only thing left, the latest chapter in Trek lore is likely to strike a chord with viewers in 2020</p><p>After three seasons, Star Trek: Discovery has got around to boldly going where no one had gone before – namely 900 years into the future, far beyond the time periods charted out with extensive lore by other Trek shows.</p><p>This decision, and the accompanying hypnotic space worms, disreputable space bazaars and alluring space rogues, comes as a great relief. Discovery has been hemmed in since its inception by everything else bearing the Star Trek name. The show was originally set 10 years before the original series, in a parallel universe populated by the characters of the current Trek movie franchise, also named Kirk and Spock, rather than the versions played by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy – though not played by the actors in the recent films, either – and if that all sounds confusing, and possibly not worth spelunking through Wikipedia to work out, then good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/16/star-trek-discovery-season-three-review-its-most-thoughtful-series-yet">Continue reading...</a>

As the sound of rubber dragging on asphalt gets louder, reality hits: you’ve got a flat tyre.</p><p>Whether punctures happen on the way to work or mid-Strava segment on your Sunday training ride, flats are a frustrating part of life on two wheels.

<p>There are glimpses of Tremain at her best in a passionate tale of coloniser and colonised in the British empire </p><p>The central figure of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/07/rose-tremain-dont-want-to-write-for-vengeance">Rose Tremain</a>’s new novel<em> </em>is Jane Adeane, a young woman of towering height who is convinced that one day “she and her magnificent inches would accomplish something the world would find extraordinary”. For the time being she assists her father in his work as a surgeon in Victorian Bath, ministering to patients who flock to the city in search of a water cure. The fact that she does this dressed all in white earns her the nickname “the Angel of the Baths”, but it also makes her the object of the unwanted “sexual and monetary ambition” of her father’s assistant, Dr Valentine Ross. After rejecting Ross’s proposal, Jane decamps to London, seeking refuge with her aunt Emmeline, a successful painter who introduces her to bohemian London society.</p><p>The narration weaves together the close third-person perspectives of a large cast of characters. Jane’s love affair with Julietta Sims, a married woman who delights in promiscuity, epitomises the kind of unorthodoxy that will reveal to Jane the dissatisfactions of her own dull conventionality. It’s the novel’s best section, rendered in prose so supple it will remind you of Tremain at her best, in novels such as <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/25/fiction.features">The Colour</a> </em>and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/nov/12/featuresreviews.guardianreview3">Music and Silence</a></em>, and conjuring vocabulary for the experience of being imprisoned and liberated all at once. Sexual abandon is experienced as “a kind of near-drowning in some dark element into which she had never before fallen”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/16/islands-of-mercy-by-rose-tremain-review-a-globe-trotting-adventure">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nothing but sky above and unbroken views all around – there is something so glorious about getting to the natural end of a climb</p><p>I’ll start by saying this: the Sherpa people do not get enough credit. They have been climbing Everest since for ever, like it’s nothing. The man who has climbed Everest the most times is <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-48464030">Kami Rita Sherpa</a> (24 times) who I imagine files his nails as he does it. Lhakpa Sherpa holds the record for most summits by a woman (9) and, incredibly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/31/mount-everest-lhakpa-sherpa-climbed-nine-times-world-record">now resides in the US </a> and works a minimum wage job at 7-Eleven.</p><p>I doubt I will be summiting Everest (never say never!) but I was schooled in climbing early on. Both my parents were climbers (my mother even free-climbed while pregnant which… maybe don’t do that). I reached the top of Moel Famau in Wales, aged three (OK, it’s 555m high to Everest’s 8,850 metres, but it was baby steps, quite literally). At seven, I topped Snowdon (1,085m). I crawled up and cried a lot. I recall being extremely unimpressed by a crappy cafe on the top, a little like when I first went on the internet and it was just a browser window rather than an actual portal to another world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/16/dont-need-to-climb-everest-modest-summit-brings-big-rewards">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Available online</strong><br />Wayne Eagling’s choreographic pedigree is clear in this wartime story of Marie Rambert – founder of Britain’s first ballet company – and her playwright husband <br /></p><p>Canadian choreographer Wayne Eagling has been somewhat off the radar since leaving his post as artistic director of English National Ballet in 2012. But here’s a chance to see a piece of his you might have missed, made in 2018 for New English Ballet Theatre, a chamber-sized but hearteningly ambitious company of young dancers dedicated to new choreography.<br /><br />Created to mark the end of the first world war centenary, Remembrance is based on the story of Marie Rambert – founder of Britain’s first ballet company – and her husband, the playwright Ashley Dukes. The pair met and then married when Dukes was on leave during the war. When he left again for the front, the newlyweds couldn’t know whether they would see each other again. It was a story common to all wartime couples, the anxieties and uncertainties of waiting for a loved one’s return.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/16/new-english-ballet-theatre-remembrance-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sibil Fox Richardson fights for her husband Robert’s release from a 60-year sentence for armed robbery in this engaging if uneven documentary</p><p>This is a viscerally emotional documentary about Sibil Fox Richardson, an African-American woman from New Orleans who almost two decades ago began a passionate, desperate campaign for her husband, Robert, to be parolled from Louisiana state penitentiary where he had been sentenced to 60 years for armed robbery. Sibil had served three-and-a-half years in jail for her own bungled role as the supposed getaway driver for this farcical and easily foiled crime, which resulted in no serious injuries and whose perpetrators had no previous convictions.</p><p>Pathetically, the couple had hoped to invest the supposed proceeds in their own hip-hop clothing store. The film shows Sibil in her new role as a mature and impressive inspirational speaker and the devoted mother of four children, juxtaposing this with her 90s home-video footage, showing her as a girlish twentysomething. Sibil is a compelling figure here and there is real drama and power in the contrast between her youth and middle age, growing old as the children grow up, in the shadow of the pitiless “time” that her husband is serving. Her commanding personality is, for me, more important than the film’s problems.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/16/time-review-sibil-fox-richardson-robert-armed-robbery-husband-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The singer-songwriter’s career of intense highs and devastating deceptions is explored in a revealing new memoir</p><p>Peter Frampton recalls with stinging clarity the moment in 1976 when he realized his career was about to take a perilous turn. “I realized that instead of the front row being a mixture of 50-50, male and female, in the audience, it was all females at the front and the guys are pissed off at the back,” he said. “The guys would jeer at me.”</p><p>In that moment, Frampton was downgraded from a respected musician to a disposable teen idol. His credibility was being questioned at a time when the standards for such things in music were set in stone, with particular scorn directed at any rock star who was swooned over by teenage girls. Worse, his sales of over 14m copies of the double album Frampton Comes Alive, a world record at the time, set expectations impossibly high for his future. “The success was just so enormous,” he said. “I’m sure it affected me mentally.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/16/peter-frampton-interview-memoir">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Strict new measures have been imposed on cities in the north of England this week in an attempt to control the increasing spread of Covid-19 infections. But the way the new restrictions have been rolled out has angered local leaders and residents alike, says Josh Halliday</p><p>This week has seen a major escalation of Covid-19 restrictions across the UK. A sharp rise in cases in Northern Ireland saw it return to full lockdown, pubs stayed shut across the central belt of Scotland and there were new travel bans imposed in Wales. But as <strong>Josh Halliday </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana,</strong> it was in England that there was most controversy. Boris Johnson replaced his localised “whack-a-mole” strategy with a national plan that divides England into three tiers.</p><p>From tonight London and parts of the Midlands have been moved up into the second tier preventing households from mixing indoors. But the toughest restrictions – and the greatest controversies – have centred on parts of the north of England. The Liverpool region has gone into tier 3 measures – with pubs, gyms and cinemas closed – but Greater Manchester has been resisting them fiercely. Its mayor, Andy Burnham, has given voice to a wider fury about a lack of warning, poor communication and inadequate financial support. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/16/covid-in-the-uk-a-new-north-south-divide-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
