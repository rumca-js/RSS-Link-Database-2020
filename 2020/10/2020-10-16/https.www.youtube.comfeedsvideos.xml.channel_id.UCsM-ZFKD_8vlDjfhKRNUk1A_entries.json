I was lost\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself\nAnd I didn't know? I was lost\nI tried carrying the weight of the world\nBut I only have two hands\nI hope I get the chance to travel the world\nBut I don't have any plans\nI wish that I could stay forever this young\nNot afraid to close my eyes\nLife's a game? made for everyone\nAnd love is the prize\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself\nAnd I didn't know? I was lost\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself\nAnd I didn't know? I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nI didn't know I was lost\nSo wake me up when it's all over\nWhen I'm wiser and I'm older\nAll this time I was finding myself\nAnd I didn't know?
