A train comes into the station, stops and many travelers get off the cars, while others get on.

This movie scared the audience because they thought the train would go through the screen. People were not used to seeing anything like that before. Film became a huge sensation and Lumiere quickly understood the potential of cinema. Observe picture composition. Lumiere made sure that the train entered diagonally, splitting the frame in two. White and light tones on the bottom right, and dark train on the top left. Fine photography skills.  

The shooting period was assigned based on the age of the Lumière children in this view. Two other uncatalogued versions were shot, probably by Louis Lumière, on the same platform. The first is before view n ° 741. It was shot at the beginning of 1896 because a reproduction of 32 photograms illustrates an article entitled Le Cinématographe. It is perhaps this version which was projected on January 25, 1896 in Lyon (France) under the title L'Arrivée en gare d'un chemin de fer ( Lyon Républicain, January 26, 1896). The second uncatalogued shot could be another shot of shot # 741 due to the identical vegetation, but this detail does not provide information on the year of shooting.
