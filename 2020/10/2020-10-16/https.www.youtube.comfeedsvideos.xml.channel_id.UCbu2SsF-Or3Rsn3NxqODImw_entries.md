The PlayStation 5’s UI has finally been revealed. Let’s take a look at the nine biggest changes we saw, including the Control Center, Activity Cards, and capturing screenshots.

Sony has finally unveiled one of the last remaining pieces of the PlayStation 5 puzzle and with it given us a clearer picture of what gaming will be like on its upcoming new console. The platform holder dropped a video showcasing the PS5's user interface and it's a drastic change from what we had on the PlayStation 4.

The change is immediately noticeable, as the PS5 features a cleaner, more elegant UI that is designed for 4K displays. It's also rather minimalist, at least when compared to the many, many menus the PS4 throws up in an average gaming session. 

But beyond the slick look and snappy movement, there are numerous exciting and, dare we say it, revolutionary features that will drive our gameplay experiences. In this video Kurt Indovina talks through nine of the biggest changes and the next-gen gaming features that have defined those changes. 

You'll get to see the new home screen, the impressive Control Center, the game-changing Activity Cards, how screenshots are captured, the new ways you can interact with friends, and more.

It's only a month to go until the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S launch, and there's plenty of news to go over. The Generation Next gang discuss the PS5 UI, Xbox's backwards compatibility improvements, and more information from our Xbox Series X hands-on. 

In just a few week's time, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S will be available. We're on the cusp of a new generation of gaming and it's incredibly exciting. Unsurprisingly, both Sony and Microsoft are delivering new information about their hot new platforms almost daily, which means there's plenty for the Generation Next crew to discuss.

This week, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor talk about the PlayStation 5 UI, which Sony finally unveiled. It's a drastic difference from what we've become used to after years of gaming on the PlayStation 4. Crucially, it has been built with the gaming experience given the highest priority and focus. 

Whether it's the redesigned home screen, seamless integration of parties, messaging, and screen share, or the fascinating new control center and its activity cards, there's a lot of interesting and exciting new features, as well as quality-of-life improvements, to chat about. 

Microsoft, for its part, has been bolstering its efforts around messaging the impressive implementation of backwards compatibility on the Xbox Series X/S. It also pulled the curtain back on some of the other performance upgrades the powerful new hardware will enable. 

GameSpot's very own Michael Higham has published his comprehensive Xbox Series X preview, so the Generation Next crew comb through it and discuss his impressions. If you had questions about Quick Resume, how backwards compatibility might beef up the performance of older games, or how standard USB hard drives work with the console, we've got the answers.

Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.
