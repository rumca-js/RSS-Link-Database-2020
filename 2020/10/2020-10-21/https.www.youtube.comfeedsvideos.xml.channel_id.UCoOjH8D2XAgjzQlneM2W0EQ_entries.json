And you just turned into a \u201cspecial interest group\u201d that just hired their first lobbyist.\n\nThe main reason why people hire lobbyists is to get the government to stop doing something, or to get the government to do something that would benefit them. Whatever the reason is, this is why the business of legal bribes is so big.\n\nIn business, people sell goods and services, in DC, lobbyists sell ideas their clients want them to sell. If you do it right, politicians will never even realize they\u2019re being legally bribed. The last thing you want to do is to scream and yell at these politicians about how \u201cif you don\u2019t support this bill...l!\u201d But at the same time, the conversation is almost never just \u201cgive me $100,000 and I\u2019ll vote this way\u201d. No matter who you are, if someone does something for you without asking, you\u2019re gonna be compelled to return the favor in order to maintain your self image as a fair, just person.\n\nIn January 2006, Jack Abramoff was sentenced to six years in federal prison for conspiracy to bribe public officials, tax evasion, etc. They were accused of secretly splitting multi-million dollar profits. Abramoff became the poster child for everything that was wrong with big money in politics. If he was the biggest and only villain in DC, when he finally went to prison - why didn\u2019t corruption in DC end?\n\nEveryone cringes at the thought of dirty \u201cspecial interest\u201d groups and \u201clobbyists\u201d - but are they the only problem? Are they the only ones in Washington with \u201cspecial\u201d interests? After all, the only thing that gives these \u201cevil\u201d lobbyists any power is because of the simple fact that the politicians have power to be bought in the first place! The bigger the government gets, the more potential for corruption there will be. If you believe in that, you\u2019re gonna have to accept that big money will always be a part of big politics.\n\nRockefeller is often remembered as the richest man in history, the king of the greedy capitalist pigs. Yet, since he got his first job as a broke 16 year old, one thing he always made time for, no matter how broke he was, was charitable giving. So before you go complaining about how big corporations rule the world and how unfair life is - the solution might just be right inside your wallet.\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
