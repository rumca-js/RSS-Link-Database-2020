LYRICS

Invisible people
Yeah they’re invisible
They are invisible people
Yeah they’re invisible

Talk to them when you’re in the car
In the shower they like to argue argue argue argue argue with you
Know exactly what you would say
Then they’ll see what you’re made of are you are you seeing me too

Dealing with invisible people
Dealing with the hole in our chest
Some of them are good, some are evil
All of them are just in our heads
 
Invisible people
Yeah they’re invisible
They are invisible people
Yeah they’re invisible
  
I’ll convince you that I was right
In my pillow where are you hiding hiding hiding hiding I can hear
All your whispers and your white lies
Walk straight through me you knew me why did why did why did you just disappear
