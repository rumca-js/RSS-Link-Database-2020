We asked you for your burning questions about Cyberpunk 2077. You asked about its map, vehicles, how long to beat the game, and more, and we've got answers. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is launching very soon, and despite numerous Night City Wire presentations, there are still plenty of questions surrounding the game. Questions such as how big its open world is, if you can purchase different apartments around Night City, and how its vehicle and melee combat feels.

We asked our YouTube subscribers for their burning questions about the game, and there were hundreds to go through. To answer these questions, Lucy James is joined by Cyberpunk lore master Jean-Luc Seipke, and Jake Dekker, who has actually played a number of hours of the game. 

They both write and host a series on the lore of Cyberpunk, which is also well worth checking out if you're interested in the world that 2077 takes place in. Cyberpunk 2077 launches on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia on November 19, and will be playable on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. Optimization patches for the next-gen versions of the game are coming in 2021.

We explore the world and gain new abilities and weapons in the first 20 minutes of Immortals Fenyx Rising.

Ahead of the release of Immortals Fenyx Rising, we had the chance to play the opening four hours of the game. This includes the game's character creator, prologue, introduction to the hub, and quest to save Aphrodite by reuniting the goddess of love with her true essence.

In the video above, we focus on those first two, showcasing how Immortals begins. If you're at all interested in checking out the game for yourself, Ubisoft has released a free demo on Google Stadia. All you need is a Gmail account.

In the opening sections of Immortals, protagonist Fenyx washes up on the shore of the Golden Isle. They learn that they're the last living mortal from their crew--the rest, including their older brother, have been turned to stone. In order to save their fellow humans, Fenyx decides to enlist the help of the gods. But they soon learn that Zeus and his family are in more trouble than they are. 

If you think the opening of Immortals looks a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild--good eye! Both games have similar starts. Like Link in Breath of the Wild, Fenyx is initially constricted to a small area where you learn the basic movement and exploration mechanics and also acquire the standard powers and abilities for your adventure, including a means of gliding through the air. With the ability to fly, Fenyx is able to reach the main, much larger area of the game. Upon landing, Fenyx's adventure truly begins.

There is no better time than now to be a gamer, and that’s simply because we have a lot of options for what we play and how we play it.

PS Now offers the ability to stream over 700 games, 400 of which are downloadable, and thankfully Bloodborne is available for both options. But what about The Last Of Us?

Xbox Series X|S-exclusive Scorn draws its inspiration from H.R. Giger's work on the Alien franchise and the surreal art of Zdzisław Beksiński. Watch the unsettling and horrifying results in this exclusive 13-minute gameplay video.

Ebb Software's Scorn is a dark and grotesque horror-adventure game set within a bio-mechanical labyrinth. It was first revealed in 2016 and is a narrative-driven FPS that combines grotesque body-horror and action gameplay with the bizarre and nightmarish imagery from H.R. Giger's work on the Alien franchise.

Scorn will launch on PC and for the Xbox Series X|S as a next-gen console exclusive, with a planned release set for sometime in 2021. Ebb Software has now revealed more of what's to come with the game, showcasing a near-final look at the horror game.

In the gameplay video, there's a sense that Scorn aims to put players in a state of confusion, which, based on the gameplay, intensifies over time. The imagery shown off in this video is extremely weird, but it's still interesting--especially for fans for enjoyed the Alien series.

According to the developers, as well as taking direct inspiration from H.R. Giger, it also draws upon the works of surrealist artist Zdzisław Beksiński. The result is something that is designed to put you in a constant state of discomfort, but still leaves you eager to delve deeper into its world.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be optimized on Series X & S, you can now stream your Xbox One games to your iPhone or iPad, and Cyberpunk 2077 will have full lip-sync for all its supported languages.

In your Save State for October 20, Chastity tells you about how Halo: The Master Chief Collection is getting Xbox Series X & S optimizations such as support for 120 FPS and up to 4K.

Speaking of Xbox games, the Xbox app on iOS just got an update that lets you stream games from your Xbox One console to your iPhone or iPad. You'll be able to do the same for the Series X and S when they launch, but it doesn't work with backwards-compatible Xbox 360 and original Xbox games. This is distinct from Microsoft's xCloud service.

In Cyberpunk news, 2077 will have lip-sync animations in all 10 of the game's supported languages. The feat was achieved in collaboration with Jali Research Inc., which helped streamline the massive animation process.
