This Friday, Oct. 23, Adrienne Lenker releases a solo project, "songs" and "instrumentals," on 4AD Records. The releases are two distinct collections, both written and recorded in April after Big Thief’s March tour was abruptly cut short due to coronavirus. Lenker settled into a cabin in Massachusetts and recorded the music using an acoustic guitar and a completely analog setup. Lenker's band, Big Thief, have visited The Current studio on a couple of occasions; here are three performances from those sessions.

Mary Lucia talks with Cecilia Johnson, producer of The Current Rewind podcast.

The Current Rewind is the podcast putting music's unsung stories on the map. In season two, the program traces the 50-year history of Minneapolis club First Avenue, using 10 pivotal dates to explore how a city, a scene, and popular music have evolved since the dawn of the '70s. Mary and Cecilia talk not only about what happens behind the scenes of making this podcast, but also about First Avenue's past, present and — we certainly hope — future.
