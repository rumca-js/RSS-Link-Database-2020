Sexual assault allegations. A Supreme Court ruling that could hold the keys to freedom. In the third and final installment of Mac's story, we follow the ripples of Mac's case two decades after the verdict was handed down. What do the roadblocks in Mac's fight for exoneration say about liberty and justice for all? And how does his imprisonment affect the loved ones he's left behind?\n\nARTWORK by Dale Edwin Murray / MUSIC by Kassa Overall / VIDEO by Renee Klahr\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nWHAT'S \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"?\nRhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. \"Louder Than A Riot\" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles \u2014 the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts, questions and feedback.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | October 21, 2020\nIt's been 15 years since the legendary guitarist Leo Kottke put out a new recording, and it's no coincidence that his new music is with Phish bassist Mike Gordon. The two have a history of making albums together, but that hit a hiatus in 2005 with their Sixty Six Steps project. They're back with a 2020 album, Noon, and Phish drummer Jon Fishman joins the duo. And while they're miles apart for this Tiny Desk (home) concert, Leo at Creation Audio in Minneapolis and Mike and Jon at Tank Recording Studio in Burlington, Vt., there's plenty of humor and spirit traversing the wires.\n\nThey begin with what fans of Leo Kottke fell in love with 50 years ago, the sound of his acoustic guitar fingerpicking. Mike Gordon punctuates the opening song \"Flat Top,\" which at moments feels like a musical chase. Jon Fishman is a tasteful addition. Mike and Jon have played over 2,000 shows together, so there's telepathy there. Still, he also finds ways into the music that isn't merely rhythmic; he adds aural atmospherics with brushes in hand. There are some fun visual tricks but \u2014 musically speaking \u2014 not a moment of trickery. Just pure magic.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Flat Top\"\n\"The Only One\"\n\"Sheets\"\n\"I Am Random\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLeo Kottke: acoustic guitar, vocals\nMike Gordon: bass, vocals\nJon Fishman: drums, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nEdited and Directed by: Eli Tishberg\nVideographers: Nate Ryan and Bruce Gibbs\nMusic Produced by: Jared Slomoff\nAudio Engineers: Rob O'Dea, Miles Hanson and Steve Wiese\nProduction Assistants: Gretchen Bedard and Sam Gibbs\nRecorded and filmed at Creation Audio (Studio A), Minnesota and Tank Recording Studio, Burlington, Vt.\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nAudio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBCV3RFWCAA", "date_published": "2020-10-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
