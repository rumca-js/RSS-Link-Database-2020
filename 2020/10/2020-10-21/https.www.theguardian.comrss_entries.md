<p>In an open letter, an on-course bookmakers’ group has accused the BHA of not doing enough to get spectators back</p><p>A group which represents on-course bookmakers said on Wednesday that its members have become “the forgotten cog in the wheel that is the industry of horse racing”. The group also accused the British Horseracing Authority of being “more concerned with preserving behind closed doors status” than getting crowds back to racecourses.</p><p>In an open letter to the BHA, the Racecourse Association and relevant government departments and ministers, Lynn Garritty, the chair of the Independent On-Course Bookmakers Group, also said that many racecourse bookies face imminent ruin if limited crowds are not allowed back on to tracks “at the earliest opportunity”. Garritty pointed to the “obvious success of two pilot events at Doncaster and Warwick, where it was proved beyond doubt restricted audiences can safely attend race meetings”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/22/talking-horses-racecourse-bookies-fear-financial-ruin-if-stands-stay-empty">Continue reading...</a>

Ideally you would make everything the night before, and then assemble the following day. This is because the macarons benefit from an overnight rest in the fridge, and the meringues are best left in a (switched off) oven overnight.

<p>Derivative YA yarn about a bunch of high-schoolers having to solve problems to win a prize doesn’t bear close inspection</p><p>Targeting the demographic intersection between geeky YA fiction readers, folks interested in psychology that doesn’t go much deeper than an internet quiz, and supermarket puzzle magazine fans, this sci-fi-inflected thriller is moderately satisfying as long as you don’t think about it too much.</p><p>In a bland Arkansas suburb that happens to have been the home town of tech billionaire inventor Atticus Virtue (Chad Michael Murray), five very different high-school kids are invited to take part in an exclusive competition at his secluded mansion. The prize is a lifetime supply of chocolate … oh, sorry, no … the prize is the mansion itself – but the Willy Wonka parallels are about as blatant as the nominative determinism of the mysterious benefactor’s surname. Only this time, given Mr Virtue has been detained, the role of maybe-malevolent host-guide is taken by the disembodied voice of the house’s sentient computer, Haven (voiced by Star Trek alumna Marina Sirtis), who sets the kids a series of problems to solve that may be more dangerous than just counting jelly beans.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/max-winslow-and-the-house-of-secrets-review-lightweight-wonka-esque-movie-puzzle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>News organisations capitalising Black is a starting point. But how about challenging the veracity of police reports?</p><p>The changing of names for Black people in the US, from Colored through Negro to African American, has always been intertwined with politics. This is true today with regard to the decision of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/05/insider/capitalized-black.html">several US publications </a>to capitalise the b in Black when referring to Black people. But to understand why people have advocated for this orthographic change today, it’s necessary to turn to history.</p><p>The traditional account of these transitions suggests that Black people seek a change in name as a means of seeking political recognition. According to such a history, the term Colored was associated with slavery, which led Black people to seek to be called Negroes, a change the US census accepted in 1900. From the 1890s on, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/22/featuresreviews.guardianreview30">WEB Du Bois</a> and others campaigned for publications to capitalise the n in Negro to represent Negroes as a proper noun and hence as people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/21/black-peoples-rights-capital-letter-police">Continue reading...</a>

This is a shameful dereliction of duty by the Tories and is rightly attracting ire, both from regional mayors and the press. And yet it is striking that a similar thing is being done to another group – shielders – but with even less attention. New <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19/guidance-on-shielding-and-protecting-extremely-vulnerable-persons-from-covid-19">guidance</a> for shielding for people at high risk because of underlying health conditions was released by the government last week, but without even a small offer of financial support. The new guidance advises “vulnerable people” in high alert areas to stay at home as much as possible, but offers no support to help them cope with paying the bills or accessing food and medicine. Even in the highest alert areas, if shielders are unable to do their jobs at home, the guidance only says they “may” be eligible for some benefits.</p><p>What’s happening to people with underlying health conditions and communities in the Midlands and north are not two separate issues but clearly overlap. Boris Johnson’s second-wave strategy is consistent: restrict people’s livelihoods but offer little or no government funds to survive that.

<p>Depor, Spanish champions 20 years ago, are now in the third tier but at least have finally been able to welcome fans back to the Riazor </p><p>When at long, long last it comes, the roar rips right through you, taking you back to a better place. Suddenly there’s a release and in that moment all is right again. It’s just a goal, but it’s not. It’s the 97th minute and it’s the winner, dramatic and desperate, but that’s not it either. It shouldn’t be this good, maybe shouldn’t be good at all, but bloody hell it’s good. Time slips away, tension tears at them, and then it happens: the ball comes from the right and Eneko Bóveda heads it into the net. Deportivo La Coruña have beaten Salamanca on the opening day and there is an explosion, briefly returning everything to where it belongs.</p><p>This weekend, for the first time since March, football fans returned to stadiums in Spain. It is tentative, not welcomed by everyone <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/global-report-record-covid-cases-and-new-lockdowns-across-europe">with Covid-19 cases rising</a>, and it is limited, just a small step forward. But it is something. Something big, as it turns out; bigger than you imagined. It is hard not to be carried along, not to get lost in the emotion, to share it. That sound, that feeling, that release: how we’ve missed it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/21/hope-joy-and-tetris-a-new-start-after-fall-of-deportivo-la-coruna-third-tier">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This week we turn to the Russian composer who poured his passion and his pain into a body of works - from ballets to symphonies - that put his country on the international musical map</p><p>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840-93) was the composer who put Russia on the international musical map with his uniquely personal style – profoundly Russian in idiom but engaging with, and embracing, western European symphonic traditions. His music encapsulates wonder and joy, as well as passion, neurosis and profound tragedy: the fatalistic quality of some of his later works reflects an often unhappy life, the complexities of which have provoked extensive analysis, some of it sensationalist. Recent scholarship has revealed that he was by no means always ill at ease with his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jun/02/tchaikovsky-letters-saved-from-censors-reveal-secret-loves-homosexuality">sexual orientation</a>, as was previously thought.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/21/tchaikovsky-where-to-start-with-his-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From love rivalry to career rivalry, the ups and downs of an often toxic male friendship have a winning authenticity</p><p>I laughed hysterically during the first scene of The Climb, Michael Angelo Covino’s brilliantly original indie bromance. The setting is France, where two Americans – best friends since childhood – are on a cycling holiday. Mike (played by Covino) is head-to-toe in Lycra, obnoxiously spouting cycling terminology. His out-of-shape friend Kyle (co-writer Kyle Marvin), is trailing behind, puffing and panting. Mike waits for the start of a particularly tough climb to confess he’s been sleeping with Kyle’s fiancee. Kyle: “You’re like a real-life Judas!” Mike: “On the plus side, that makes you Jesus.” At one point, Kyle gets off his bike and carries it, running up the hill in pursuit of Mike. Tragedy and slapstick run through the film and it is very funny.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/21/the-climb-review-michael-angelo-covino-kyle-marvin">Continue reading...</a>

The truth is, it hasn’t really had to in the four years since he was elected as the 45th president of the United States. This may be Trump’s sport of choice and, yes, his courting of high-profile players has created the odd ripple, but golf managed to navigate itself to the position whereby tawdry episodes have largely been avoided. A World Golf Championship, once held at Trump-owned Doral in Miami, seamlessly shifted to Mexico City in 2017.</p><p>At this point, it hardly seems harebrained to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/20/us-election-polls-tracker-who-is-leading-in-the-swing-states">predict a Trump election defeat in 2020</a>.

<p>Most of us have a tin of the remarkably long-life fish in the cupboard – and you can do a lot more with it than mix it with mayo </p><p>When you think about it, tinned tuna is a miracle. The spoilage window for fresh oily fish is measured in days or even hours, but I bought a tin of tuna last week with a best before date of Christmas 2027. I wish I could guarantee I will still be good to go in seven years.</p><p>The original selling point of tinned tuna was its blandness – a less fishy alternative to sardines, it was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/18/how-america-fell-out-of-love-with-canned-tuna/">marketed as tasting like chicken</a> – which makes it a versatile, if not immediately inspiring ingredient. You can pay a little or a lot for tuna – anywhere from 59p to £10 a tin – and it will probably be in the form of steaks or flakes, packed in oil or brine; it may well come in a jar instead of a tin. Most recipes specify what type to use, but I wouldn’t sweat it. Tinned tuna is a culinary compromise, so just use what you have, unless it is the really expensive sort and you are saving it for a special occasion. Something is bound to come up in the next seven years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/21/17-delicious-ways-tinned-tuna-salade-nicoise-melts-fishcakes">Continue reading...</a>

In June, I co-founded <a href="https://www.instagram.com/warriorsinthegarden/?hl=en">Warriors in the Garden</a>, one of New York’s leading protest collectives, and spent nearly every day for months in the streets. This mass mobilization sprang to life following the killings of two more Black Americans, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, at the hands of the police. But the catalyst was not the fuel. Slavery came to our shores in 1619, and has for 400 years defined both the Black experience and the United States.

<p>I’ve had a string of failed relationships and I’ve been devastated by an ex-partner’s revelation and an STI diagnosis. I can’t imagine anyone would want to sleep with me again</p><p><strong>I’m a 55-year-old woman and in the past 11 years I have had a string of failed relationships. I’ve been in therapy now for a while to address my patterns around men because I really want to be able to commit to a relationship. In the meantime I’ve discovered two things that I am finding quite devastating. One is that a previous partner told me last year</strong><strong> that I was the only woman he had slept with who couldn’t achieve orgasm just by penetration. I had had no idea that orgasm without digital stimulation was possible until then. I am very jealous of women who experience this. The second is that I have discovered I have genital herpes. It presents on my lower back and has appeared about three times in five years but has only just been diagnosed. I can’t imagine anyone will ever want to sleep with me again. If I knew a man had genital herpes, I wouldn’t </strong><strong>want to sleep with him, so why on earth would anyone want to sleep with me? I am utterly shattered by this.</strong></p><p>First of all, your partner from a year ago was probably lying, or perhaps had pressured his previous partners until they resorted to faking orgasms. Sexual health professionals tend to agree that most women require at least some clitoral stimulation in order to achieve orgasm. Some men feel threatened by this fact, and many lack the knowledge, patience, technique or focus to provide sufficient clitoral pleasuring. And some men who tend to ejaculate early have never learned to sustain a lovemaking session that fully satisfies a woman. Your job is to teach a partner exactly how you like to be pleasured – and accept nothing less. And help yourself to achieve orgasm when necessary. Regarding your herpes diagnosis, you are joining the millions of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jul/23/dangerous-liaisons-why-syphilis-and-gonorrhea-have-returned-to-haunt-britain">other people in the world who have contracted it</a> – either knowingly or otherwise.

Did it feel like an insult to be paired with him? The 57-year-old laughs. “Anton got to the final last year and he’s very clear about that and very ambitious for us, as am I.” He is also – how to put this kindly? – not hellbent on stealing his partners away from their husbands. Is she relieved at not having to face the “Strictly curse”, whereby the frisson between the dancers and their partners becomes too much to bear? Smith cackles, then adds: “I won’t have it said that Anton is not gorgeous. But he is happily married and I am in a newish, but lovely, relationship. Trust us, there will be no Strictly curse.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/21/this-is-a-chance-to-smile-again-strictlys-jacqui-smith-on-scandal-divorce-and-life-outside-politics">Continue reading...</a>

## Why the death of a small, punk-like fish rocked the marine world

<p>The smooth handfish is the first extinct marine bony fish of modern times. Scientists are now wondering how many more have disappeared unnoticed</p><p>In 1802, when French naturalist François Péron slipped a small, chunky Australian fish into a jar of preservative, little did he suspect that his unassuming prize would be the only member of its species ever known to science. The smooth handfish (<em>Sympterichthys unipennis</em>) <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/123423283/123424374">was declared extinct</a> by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/24/meet-the-now-officially-extinct-smooth-handfish">earlier this year</a>. This strange and spiny bottom-dweller made history with its passing. It became the first marine bony fish to be listed as extinct in modern times. Today, all that remains of the species is that discoloured specimen in the Natural History Museum in Paris.</p><p>Scooped up off the coast of south-east Tasmania, Péron’s catch was one of the 14 handfish species living in southern Australian waters at the time. The relatives of the smooth handfish are a colourful family which crawl around the seafloor using adapted fins as “hands”. They look like grumpy ageing punks, each sporting a dorsal fin over its head like a mohawk, bulging eyes and a cantankerous expression.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/21/why-the-death-of-a-small-punk-like-fish-rocked-the-marine-world-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

Journalist Behrouz Boochani, who spent seven years in detention in Papua New Guinea, discusses the impact the policy has had</p><p>Amid a fourfold rise in small boats attempting to cross the Channel and reach the UK this year, Downing Street and ministers have asked Foreign Office officials to consider a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/01/uk-asylum-detention-top-civil-servant-says-all-options-on-the-table">wide range of options</a> to deter asylum seekers, according to leaked documents last month. Proposals include offshore asylum processing centres, with one document suggesting Boris Johnson is personally involved in the plan, stating: ‘In addition to the work on OT [British overseas territory] options, the PM has asked for FCDO advice on potential third-country locations. We are asked to suggest options for a UK scheme similar to the Australian agreement with Papua New Guinea.’</p><p>Guardian Australia reporter<strong> Ben Doherty </strong>tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys</strong> about the history of Australia’s immigration policies, beginning in 2001, after the Tampa crisis, when a Norwegian freighter that had rescued more than 400 mainly Afghan Hazara refugees from their sinking vessel in international waters 140km north of Christmas Island was refused entry into Australian waters. The MV Tampa provided the conservative Coalition government with a catalyst for action. That was the establishment of “offshore detention” camps on Nauru and on Papua New Guinea, the so-called Pacific solution. The detention facilities have been the subject of serious criticism by international observers and human rights groups. Journalist <strong>Behrouz Boochani,</strong> who fled Iran for Australia in 2013, was sent to Manus Island. He describes the detention centre as worse than a prison and warns the UK to think hard before they look to replicate the Australian system. “If you do this, you lose your humanity” he tells Rachel. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/21/inside-australias-asylum-system-a-possible-model-for-the-uk">Continue reading...</a>
