You asked about its map, vehicles, how long to beat the game, and more, and we've got answers. \n\nCyberpunk 2077 is launching very soon, and despite numerous Night City Wire presentations, there are still plenty of questions surrounding the game. Questions such as how big its open world is, if you can purchase different apartments around Night City, and how its vehicle and melee combat feels.\n\nWe asked our YouTube subscribers for their burning questions about the game, and there were hundreds to go through. To answer these questions, Lucy James is joined by Cyberpunk lore master Jean-Luc Seipke, and Jake Dekker, who has actually played a number of hours of the game. \n\nThey both write and host a series on the lore of Cyberpunk, which is also well worth checking out if you're interested in the world that 2077 takes place in. Cyberpunk 2077 launches on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia on November 19, and will be playable on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. Optimization patches for the next-gen versions of the game are coming in 2021.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:23 - How Huge Will Cyberpunk's Open World/Map Be?\n01:17 - Will You Be Able To Purchase New Apartments In Cyberpunk & Do You Swap Weapons/Clothing From Said Home Base?\n02:19 - How Does Driving & Melee Combat In Cyberpunk Feel?\n03:33 - What's the Most Hype Cyberpunk Weapon You've Seen?\n04:54 - Furries in Cyberpunk 2077?\n06:27 - When Are The Xbox Series X/S & PS5 Upgrades Coming?\n07:26 - Can You Explore The Whole Cyberpunk Map Immediately?\n08:10 - Will Cyberpunk 2077 Be DRM Free?\n09:00 - Will Cyberpunk 2077 Have Multiplayer?\n09:37 - How Long To Beat Cyberpunk 2077?\n10:32 - Can You Play Cyberpunk 2077 Without Any Prior Knowledge of the Lore?\n12:03 - Which Lifepath Will the Hosts Go With?\n13:11 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8Wjc7gqniA", "date_published": "2020-10-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Immortals Fenyx Rising: First 20 Minutes of Gameplay", "description": "We explore the world and gain new abilities and weapons in the first 20 minutes of Immortals Fenyx Rising.\n\nAhead of the release of Immortals Fenyx Rising, we had the chance to play the opening four hours of the game. This includes the game's character creator, prologue, introduction to the hub, and quest to save Aphrodite by reuniting the goddess of love with her true essence.\n\nIn the video above, we focus on those first two, showcasing how Immortals begins. If you're at all interested in checking out the game for yourself, Ubisoft has released a free demo on Google Stadia. All you need is a Gmail account.\n\nIn the opening sections of Immortals, protagonist Fenyx washes up on the shore of the Golden Isle. They learn that they're the last living mortal from their crew--the rest, including their older brother, have been turned to stone. In order to save their fellow humans, Fenyx decides to enlist the help of the gods. But they soon learn that Zeus and his family are in more trouble than they are. \n\nIf you think the opening of Immortals looks a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild--good eye! Both games have similar starts. Like Link in Breath of the Wild, Fenyx is initially constricted to a small area where you learn the basic movement and exploration mechanics and also acquire the standard powers and abilities for your adventure, including a means of gliding through the air. With the ability to fly, Fenyx is able to reach the main, much larger area of the game. Upon landing, Fenyx's adventure truly begins.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMk2RT5zV_o", "date_published": "2020-10-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New Suits For Spider-Man: Miles Morales Revealed | Save State", "description": "More Spidey suits for PS5's Spider-Man: Miles Morales have been revealed, AOC's Among Us stream was one of the biggest Twitch streams ever, and could another Ghost of Tsushima be coming?

First up is the Crimson Cowl Suit, as well as Miles' famous T.R.A.C.K.

It was one of the biggest Twitch streams ever, maxing at 430,000 concurrent viewers on AOC's page. \n\nGhost of Tsushima developer Sucker Punch is staffing up. A job listing is looking for a narrative writer with experience in feudal Japan, but it's unknown if it's for Ghost of Tsushima DLC or for a sequel. Ghost of Tsushima will be playable on the PS5 via backwards compatibility, and it'll run at 60 FPS.

Ebb Software has now revealed more of what's to come with the game, showcasing a near-final look at the horror game.\n\nIn the gameplay video, there's a sense that Scorn aims to put players in a state of confusion, which, based on the gameplay, intensifies over time. The imagery shown off in this video is extremely weird, but it's still interesting--especially for fans for enjoyed the Alien series.\n\nAccording to the developers, as well as taking direct inspiration from H.R.
