Cases, + 414, 106 (7 days) = 8,249,011

Deaths, 220,362

Dr. Jay Butler, (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

distressing trend

increasing in nearly 75 percent of the country

This past week, we've seen nearly 60,000 cases a day on average, as well as 700 deaths

Past 2 weeks

Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Wisconsin

Cooler weather that is forcing people indoors

Smaller, more intimate gatherings with family, friends and neighbors may be driving infections

Excess Deaths From COVID-19 and Other Causes, March-July 2020 (12th October)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2771761

March 1 and August 1, 2020

Deaths, 1, 336, 561

20% increase over expected

Highest per capita

New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Louisiana, Arizona, Mississippi, Maryland, Delaware, Rhode Island, and Michigan

States that reopened earlier experienced more protracted increases in excess deaths

Of 225, 530 excess deaths, 150 541 (67%) were attributed to COVID-19

Two other causes reached statistical significance

Heart disease 

Alzheimer disease/dementia

Important message as weather gets colder

Close contact, six feet and 15 minutes, operational definition for contact tracing

Cumulative exposures can be as hazardous as 15 sustained continuous minutes of exposure

20 year old worker

Multiple brief encounters

Six out-of-state arrivals

All tested positive the day after

Officer, a week later, loss of smell and taste, muscle weakness, runny nose, cough, shortness of breath, headache, loss of appetite and an upset stomach

Video surveillance footage

Masks not worn at cell doorways

Additional factors

Proximity

Duration of exposure

Infected persons stage

How likely to generate respiratory aerosols

Ventilation and crowding

Guide decisions on quarantining and work restrictions

People with or without symptoms can be highly infectious

Importance of wearing face masks to prevent transmission

The more time you spend with someone, the more likely you are to get infected

It may have been that one of these six prisoners was a superspreader shedding an awful lot of virus

Deliberately infecting volunteers with COVID. Closely followed by the laters thinking on herd immunity

https://www.gov.uk/government/news/expert-partnership-to-explore-and-establish-human-challenge-studies-of-covid-19-in-the-uk

A vaccine candidate that has proven to be safe in initial trials

Carefully selected healthy adult volunteers, 90 people,18 - 30

Exposed to the virus in a safe and controlled environment

Closely monitor the effect on volunteers 24 hours

See exactly how the vaccine works

Identify any side effects

Controlled doses of virus

Virus characterisation study

Discover the smallest amount of virus it takes to 
cause infection 

Accelerate vaccine development

Monitored for up to a year after

Potentially saving thousands of lives

Controlled entrance to the facility

Decontamination of waste

A dedicated laboratory for carrying out tests

All the air leaving the unit is cleaned

Malaria, typhoid, cholera, norovirus and flu

60% alcohol

Indirect protection

Community immunity

Community protection

Protection of susceptible individuals

Natural infection or through vaccination

Herd Immunity Threshold

The proportion of individuals in a population, having acquired immunity, can no longer participate in the chain of transmission

Threshold

Current outbreaks will extinguish

Herd immunity threshold depends on the basic reproduction number

Measles, will have a high R0 = 12-18

SARS-CoV-2 R0 = 2 to 3

Expected to range between 50% and 67% in the absence of any interventions

Duration of Protection

Durability of immune memory is a critical factor

Determining population-level protection and sustaining herd immunity

Measles, varicella, rubella

Seasonal coronaviruses

Pool of susceptible individuals increases again

Periodic vaccination can maintain herd immunity

Role of Heterogeneity

Nominal herd immunity thresholds assume random mixing between individuals

T-Cell Cross-reactivity

Cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses may confer relative protection

Less clear about sterilizing immunity

Host could not carry nor transmit infection …

as opposed to reducing the severity of illness

Infection-Based Herd Immunity as Policy

Letting the low-risk groups become infected

Sequestering or guarding susceptible groups

Low infection fatality ratios

Full guarding impractical

Zika in Salvador, Brazil

Sweden, until late March

Seroprevalence in Stockholm, 8% in April 2020

Similar to Geneva, Barcelona

United States 

330 million

World Health Organization estimates, IFR = 0.5%

198 million to reach a herd immunity threshold of 60%

Conclusions

Infection-induced herd immunity is not realistic at this point 

Vaccination programs must be efficient and broadly adopted
