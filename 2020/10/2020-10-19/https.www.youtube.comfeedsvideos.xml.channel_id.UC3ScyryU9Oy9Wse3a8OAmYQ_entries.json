People cheat. Mail ballots \u2026 are fraudulent, in many cases,\u201d the president said in April, going on to repeatedly claim a link between widespread election fraud and mail-in ballots \u2014 which could be cast in numbers as high as 70 million in the November election, as voters look to avoid risking potential exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nTo date, confirmed instances of what\u2019s been called voter fraud have been relatively rare \u2014 often the result of mistakes rather than ill intent. \"I can tell you \u2026 that the widespread fraud that would allow a conclusion of \u2018elections are rigged\u2019 is not there. The evidence does not show that,\u201d Benjamin Ginsberg, whose tenure as the Bush-Cheney campaign\u2019s national counsel included the 2000 Bush-Gore recount, told FRONTLINE. A more pervasive problem, experts say, is disenfranchisement caused by the proportion of mail-in ballots that are discarded on technicalities.\n\nYet the president\u2019s claims were not the first time a politician had sought to draw an association between mail-in ballots and voter fraud. The above excerpt from \"Whose Vote Counts,\" a collaborative documentary from FRONTLINE, Columbia Journalism Investigations and reporters from the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel and USA TODAY, explores how and when that connection entered the political conversation on a significant level.\n\nWatch \"Whose Vote Counts\" starting Tues., Oct. 20: \nhttps://to.pbs.org/3jecZef\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
