Survival of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus on the human skin: Importance of hand hygiene in COVID-19 (Clinical Infectious Diseases, 3rh October, Accepted manuscript)

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1517/5917611

What is the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on the human skin?

We evaluated the stability of:

SARS-CoV-2

Influenza A virus (IAV)

Mixed with culture medium or upper respiratory mucus

Results:

SARS-CoV-2 became inactive in 9.4 hours

IAV became inactive in 1.82 hours

Both became inactive more quickly than on other surfaces (stainless steel/glass/plastic)

Both became inactive in 15 seconds, on skin, with 80% ethanol

Conclusions: 

The 9-h survival of SARS-CoV-2 on human skin may increase the risk of contact transmission in comparison with IAV

thus accelerating the pandemic

Proper hand hygiene is important to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infections

The data is no longer showing the exponential increases that we were seeing a couple of weeks ago

but is clearly showing new cases continuing to rise

The North West, most cases, doubling times of around 10 days

Scotland, Wales, London, Midlands, doubling time of 14-28 days

South and East of England, relatively flat, five-fold fewer cases than the worst hit regions

Short, sharp national lockdown from Friday, 6 pm until 9 November.

Firebreak

23rd October, from 6 pm to 9th November

17 days

Stay at home except for very limited reasons, such as exercise

Work from home if possible

Must not visit other households, or meet other people they do not live either indoors and outdoors

All non-food retail will shut, and cafes, restaurants and pubs will close

Takeaway only unless they provide delivery or takeaways

Hotels, hairdressers and beauticians will have to shut

Visitors from any part of the UK not allowed until 9th November

Schools

Primary schools will reopen after the half-term break

Secondary schools shut

Gatherings indoors and outdoors with people not in your household will also be banned

First Minister Mark Drakeford

time-limited firebreak

a short, sharp, shock

to turn back the clock

slow down the virus and buy us more time

this is our best chance of regaining control of the virus and avoiding a much-longer - and damaging - national lockdown

Without action the NHS would not be able to cope

Face masks still requiring in public places indoors

Time for:

More test and trace staff

Catch up on contacts already identified

## COVID, Infection Fatality Rates

Infection fatality rate of COVID-19 inferred from seroprevalence data (WHO / Stanford, 14th October)

https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf

Estimate the infection fatality rate

From seroprevalence data 

61 studies (74 estimates)

Eight preliminary national estimates

Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.02% to 53.40%

Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63%

Overall IFR

Across 51 locations

Median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.23%

Most locations probably have an infection fatality rate less than 0.20% 

In people less than 70 years

Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.31%

Medians of 0.05%. 

Factors in areas with low IFR

Younger population (excluding Japan)

Previous immunity from other coronaviruses

Genetic differences

Hygiene etiquette

Lower infectious load

Other unknown factors

Country  IFR  under 70

Argentina  0.13  0.09

Brazil  0.27  0.9

BC   0.59  0.08 

Denmark  0.27  0.04

France  0.3  0.03

Italy   1.2  0.22

Netherlands 0.68  0.09

NY   0.65  0.25

S Florida  0.25  0.08

Louisiana  0.3  0.1

Bay   0.12  0.03

Georgia  0.44  0.15

Assessing the Age Specificity
of Infection Fatality Rates for COVID-19: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Public Policy Implications 
6th October

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v6.full.pdf

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v6

0.4% at age 55

1.4% at age 65

4.6% at age 75

15% at age 85

Exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19

Differences in the age structure of the population explain about 90% of the geographical variation in IFR 

Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths 

Humoral Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 
in Iceland 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2026116?articleTools=true

Measured antibodies in 1,215 diagnosed with quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay

Measured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2

Measured antibodies in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed 

In diagnoses people

1,107 of the 1,215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive

Antibodies increased during 2 months after diagnosis

Remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study

In quarantined people

2.3% were seropositive

In people not known to have been exposed

0.3% tested antibody positive
Conclusions

We estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2

Infection was fatal in 0.3% overall

New knowledge about the Iceland epidemic

We also estimate that 56% of all infections in Iceland had been diagnosed with qPCR

14% of infections had occurred in quarantined persons who had not been tested with qPCR

30% of infections had occurred in persons not known to have been exposed

Conclusions

Antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not decline within 4 months after diagnosis

Risk of death from infection was 0.3%

44% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Iceland were not diagnosed by qPCR.
