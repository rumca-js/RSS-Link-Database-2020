Fireteam is its own game type and Treyarch indicated more modes will be added over time. In Dirty Bomb, four teams of ten players run around two maps collecting uranium and arming five bomb sites. When bombs detonate, that area of the map fills with radiation forcing teams to other locations. After all bombs detonate the map resets and players continue to accrue points until one team wins. The mode also has a number of drivable vehicles including dirt bikes, snowmobiles, and attack helicopters.\u00a0\n\nDirty Bomb adds some systems from Infinity Ward\u2019s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone battle royale mode. This includes crates containing killstreaks, an armor plate system, a ping communication system, functional doors, and a respawn system with both squad spawn and parachuting. In this video, we go over what is and is not working with Dirty Bomb.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nCall of Duty: Blacks Ops Cold War releases on November 13 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

We break down the best solutions to solve this without breaking the bank or your data cap.\n\nThe Xbox Series X comes with a 1TB internal SSD and with the size of games today, that can fill up fast. It's also worth mentioning that the Series S only has a 512GB drive. So, you'll probably be looking for ways to expand the storage capacity for your new Xbox console at some point. And we have some solutions for you.\n\nMicrosoft is offering a 1TB expansion card from Seagate which works identically to the internal SSD. It's built to take advantage of the same speeds, and it slots right into the back of the console. While it's the best performing solution, it's relatively expensive at $220 (which is fair for NVMe SSDs). You can also use external USB drives, though there are some conditions you'll need to be aware of.\n\nYou can still use the Quick Resume game-swapping feature for games running off of USB drives. But keep in mind that USB drives can only play Xbox One, Xbox 360, and original Xbox backwards compatible games. You can store Series X/S games on a USB drive but they need to be transferred to the internal storage or Seagate expansion card in order to be played.\n\nSo, for external drive testing, we used a Samsung T5 portable SSD through USB 3.1--the data transfer speeds were quite fast and load times were very close to the internal SSD. The Samsung T5 is also much cheaper than the Seagate expansion card. Using the Western Digital My Passport, a traditional external hard drive with USB 3.0, things slowed down as expected, but it wasn't too bad. Transfer speeds were reasonable and load times were a bit better than what they were on the Xbox One X. And if you want bulk storage for cheap, this is the route you'll probably want to go.\n\nYou can get details on how we tested drives, our specific results, and our advice for storage options by watching the video above.

On PS5 | Save State", "description": "On today's Save State, Persia talks about P.T. not being playable on the PS5, the PS5's fan being optimized over time, and the Black Ops Cold War beta being extended for another 24 hours. \n\nIn this video, Persia talks about P.T. not being downloadable on the PS5. Since it cannot be downloaded, that means it also won't be backwards compatible. PT was removed from the PlayStation Store in 2015 and Silent Hills fans are still clamoring for a reboot 5 years later, but back in March, Konami confirmed that it's just not happening.\n\nPersia also talks about the PS5 fan being optimized over time. Sony will collect data from the fan's Accelerated Processing Unit, allowing the fan to run at different speeds depending on what's necessary for whatever game you're playing at that time.\n\nAnd lastly, Persia talks about the Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War beta being extended for another 24 hours to all players on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. PS4 players don't need PlayStation Plus to try it, but you do need Xbox Live Gold for the Xbox version and a Battle.net account for PC. All attachments are unlocked and there's now Double XP. The beta has Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, Control, and the new Combined Arms and Dirty Bomb modes. Black Ops Cold War will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X, Series S, and PC on November 13.\n\nThis is your Save State for Monday, October 19th. \n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:22 - P.T.
