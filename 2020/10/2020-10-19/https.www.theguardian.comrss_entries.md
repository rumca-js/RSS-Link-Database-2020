<p>Former Arsenal manager reflects on his 22 years in charge of the club, how hurt he was by malicious rumours when he first arrived and how he has managed to move on from his life’s obsession<br /></p><p>Arsène Wenger still believes he could milk a cow but, as he says with a smile: “I haven’t tried for a long time. I might have lost the technique a little bit.” Wenger is one of the most humane and original thinkers in football and so it is not surprising that, moving beyond his “obsession”, we should spend 100 minutes talking about much more than the game that consumes him.</p><p>Whether describing how he learned to milk cows as a boy in the Alsace village of Duttlenheim, or reliving his first memory as a five-year-old watching his local football team while clutching a prayer book, Wenger stresses his life has been built on the pillars of hard work and faith. “It’s amazing that you make your life with the values from childhood. I think all the champions I have met have been the same. They had the root of their motivations in childhood.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/20/arsene-wenger-a-sense-of-anger-humiliation-hate-every-defeat-is-still-a-scar-on-my-heart">Continue reading...</a>

The 23-year-old graduate from Preston has volunteered to clean up beaches, investigated the politics behind the Amazon forest fires, researched alternatives to plastic packaging and given up her time to edit a digital magazine for the environmental organisation <a href="https://www.louderthanthestorm.com/" rel="nofollow">Louder Than The Storm</a>.</p><p><strong>Jobs with purpose wanted<br /></strong>Bennett isn’t alone in looking for graduate opportunities in the environmental sector. A 2018 <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/views-on-the-green-economy-survey-of-young-people" rel="nofollow">survey from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</a> found that almost two-thirds (60%) of 18-24 year olds were interested in pursuing a career in the green economy. Even in other industries, this generation of young jobseekers wants to work for organisations that takes sustainability seriously. The graduate recruitment app <a href="https://debut.careers/" rel="nofollow">Debut</a> found that 89% of female and 80% of male students and graduates say they want to work for an organisation with a strong environmental policy. Increasingly, those credentials are being highlighted in job ads, even if the role itself would not be considered “green”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-green-jobs/2020/oct/19/green-jobs-for-graduates-what-should-you-study-and-how-can-you-reskill">Continue reading...</a>

## What Sergio Agüero did to Sian Massey-Ellis was not OK – just ask any woman | Suzanne Wrack

<p>Those who defend the Manchester City striker’s grabbing of the official are blind to the context that makes it indefensible </p><p>After Sergio Agüero had vented his frustrations at Sian Massey-Ellis for not awarding a throw-in in the 41st minute of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/17/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Manchester City’s 1-0 win against Arsenal</a> on Saturday, the official walked away. Agüero then reached out and grabbed the base of the 35-year-old’s neck. Eyes firmly forward, Massey-Ellis flinched out of his touch and brushed it off.</p><p>It was over in a flash. But social media exploded. Clips of the incident went viral. I was one of those to watch, cringe and tweet – “<a href="https://twitter.com/SuzyWrack/status/1317560841462550528?s=20">Disgraceful, unprofessional and patronising</a>.” Within 24 hours my post had 8,800 likes, 716 retweets and 236 comments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/19/what-sergio-aguero-did-to-sian-massey-ellis-was-not-ok-just-ask-any-woman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dismissed by the press at the time, and now all but forgotten, we need a reminder of the mind-blowing band who ushered in punk and multimedia raves</p><p>Early evening, 13 July 1972, and something strange and rather wonderful is about to happen. On the previous edition of Top of the Pops, David Bowie had both entranced and outraged the nation by casually draping his arm around Mick Ronson, but this week’s show is set to feature a performance that will prompt just as many excited playground discussions as Bowie’s.</p><p>The studio cuts to the gloom of a provincial dance hall, and a shot of a crowd already in the throes of what looks like religious ecstasy. On stage, a striking young woman with a silver face salutes the air and then enacts a secret ceremony, as a dirty whoosh of crunching guitar and pounding drums begins to pour from the TV. A band member frenziedly shakes a flute above his head like a space-age sceptre; another stoops over a table of mysterious electronic devices. The bass-playing singer steps up to the mic and bellows, “I just took a ride in a Silver Machine…”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/19/why-hawkwind-were-the-great-radicals-of-1970s-rock">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A mini tempest in the kitchen and some sage sisterly advice gives life to this comforting bowl of pumpkin and rice soup</p><p>Every now and then, my kitchen and I are like a well-oiled wheel. We are a team, high on efficiency. We keep on top of the contents of the fridge and cupboards (not so much tidy as in tune with each other), spinning meals that produce more meals, managing leftovers and cleaning up as we go along. We marvel at how we have made one lasagne for lunch and another for the freezer, poached the fruit that’s threatening to go off and still have the energy to tidy a drawer.</p><p>But highs are followed by lows. Creeping ones to start: low irritation and grumbling discontent at the demands we put on each other, the damp above the sink and the sticky shelf. Creeping turns into stomping and, before you know it, I hate everything and have no idea what to cook. I share cooking and domestic tasks equally with my partner – but not discussion, at this point.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/19/rachel-roddy-recipe-pumpkin-and-rice-soup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 39-year-old’s two goals sealed a first derby win in four years for Milan, who he has helped to transform into contenders</p><p>It was one of those weekends in Serie A. Oh, you know, the sort that begins with the league leaders getting thrashed 4-1 and ends with a likely goal-of-the-season contender, while the champions drop points to a newly promoted side in between. The kind of weekend when a team can come from 3-1 down after 63 minutes to win and barely cause a ripple, because everyone is still busy talking about a picture of a lion.</p><p>The grisly image, of a big cat whose maw is dripping with blood, was posted by Zlatan Ibrahimovic to his social media accounts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CGdGD0HnzCc/">on Saturday night</a>.

<p>Crash Bandicoot is the latest of several original PlayStation icons to make a comeback – but is the new game any good?</p><p>Crash Bandicoot is back, and it’s about time. No, really – the latest instalment, Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time, picks up where Crash Bandicoot: Warped left off 22 years ago, back when every other game had to star an anthropomorphic animal. This is actually the eighth Crash game, for anyone keeping track, and the first proper new instalment for over a decade. It reinvigorates the bandicoot’s gameplay while remaining true to the original classics, but why is now the time for the return of this inexplicably underloved 90s video game icon?</p><p>The game’s director, Paul Yan, explains: “Part of the reason why it’s now is because Vicarious Visions and Beenox did such a great job with the remasters [of the original Crash Games and Crash Team Racing]. It really confirmed that there is an appetite to revisit the world of Crash … The trilogy that Naughty Dog developed was certainly the high point of the series, both critically and commercially, so we thought, let’s start from there.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/oct/19/crash-bandicoot-4-another-90s-video-game-icon-returns">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ben Wheatley’s new version of the gothic thriller Rebecca joins an impressive list of big-screen Du Maurier adaptations</p><p>Valerie Hobson plays the wife of a British MP (Michael Redgrave), who learns her husband has been killed in the second world war. Just as she is getting to grips with her loss, preparing to marry a neighbouring farmer and taking up her late husband’s seat in parliament (where Churchill is impressed by her maiden speech), he turns up alive. Apparently, reports of his death were greatly exaggerated because he was secretly working for the Resistance. Now, he expects her to return to her housewifely duties, but everything has changed. This earnest adaptation of Daphne du Maurier’s play has not aged well.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/19/10-best-daphne-du-maurier-films-rebecca-ben-wheatley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Checking for apocalyptic updates is compulsive and saddening. Reconnecting with yourself and others may be the cure</p><p>This year I have learned the secret of time travel. It goes like this: I open my eyes first thing and reach for my phone, checking the news and social media for the latest apocalyptic updates; words and images flash by in seconds, screaming BREAKING NEWS, INFECTION, OUTBREAK, DEATH TOLL. I scroll, refresh, reload. I close and open, share, type, delete, reply, all in a sort of semi-conscious fugue. And then, like some sort of modern-day <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaspar_Hauser">Kaspar Hauser</a> in tracksuit bottoms, I emerge blinking from the darkened cell of the internet and it is 5pm, and I am thinking: “Where the hell did this day go?” Twitter is a cosmic string and I’ve been pulled along with it until, beyond the windows, the light fades into night.</p><p>What I’ve been doing is called doomscrolling, a term that has <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/">caught on</a> during this year’s pandemic. For those who still dwell mostly offline, doomscrolling (and, less commonly, doomsurfing) is “the tendency to continue to surf or scroll through bad news, even though that news is saddening, disheartening, or depressing”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/19/doomscrolling-social-media-apocalyptic-updates-cure">Continue reading...</a>

Never has the prospect of watching a movie about being confined to your home and beset by unseen terrors seemed less like escapism. We’ll soon see if the pandemic has sharpened our appetite for haunted house movies or put us right off them, as they seem to be the theme of this Halloween – and almost all of them centre on women.</p><p>That’s not such a surprise, really. Unlike so many areas, ghost stories and houses of horror have been almost a haven for women, on the page and on screen. You could reason that the domestic realm was seen as a female space, and the natural receptacle for female writers’ explorations of things repressed and unspeakable. Some critics have ventured that female authors identified with ghosts – invisible figures struggling to exert an influence on reality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/19/why-haunted-house-horrors-are-more-resonant-than-ever-shirley-rebecca">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lampard needs to change tack with Chelsea’s defence, Lallana’s Indian Summer and Pickford’s failings</p><p>Sergio Agüero’s comeback after four months out with a knee injury was a 65-minute cameo that oozed class and in which he was a vital link in Raheem Sterling’s winner. City’s record goalscorer is out of contract in June and Pep Guardiola stated the club will make a new offer if the striker continues to play well while also saying Agüero knows what he has to do. “We know what he means for us, we know how we appreciate him, but now he has to show like everyone of us – me first – that we deserve to continue here and are playing good and winning games,” the manager said. “After that the club and myself decide. When he is playing at his level and we don’t have any doubts [then] he is a player to stay until he decides [to go] because he is unique, the numbers [goals].

<p>Two-year BBC News Arabic investigation uncovers horrific conditions, with boys as young as five facing violence and sexual abuse</p><p>An April evening in the suburbs of Khartoum. After months of undercover work, I had learned to time my visits to khalwas, Sudan’s Islamic schools,<strong> </strong>to coincide with evening prayers. I entered while the sheikhs (teachers) and 50-odd boys dressed in their white djellabas were busy praying. As they knelt, I heard the clanking of chains on the boys’ shackled legs. I sat down behind them and started filming, secretly. </p><p>I began investigating after allegations emerged of abuse inside some of these schools: children kept in chains, beaten and sexually abused. Khalwas have existed in Sudan for centuries. There are more than 30,000 of them across the country where children are taught to memorise the Qur’an. They are run by sheikhs who usually provide food, drink and shelter, free of charge. As a result, poor families often send their children to khalwas instead of public schools.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/oct/19/revealed-chaining-beatings-and-torture-inside-sudans-islamic-schools">Continue reading...</a>

My daughter, Bonnie Quinn, is a third-grade teacher in San Francisco’s Francis Scott Key Elementary School. Kronos plays for her students every year, and on 2 May 2018 her students were joined by pupils from Monroe Elementary School across the city for our concert. Monroe’s teacher Mark Rosenberg brought his guitar. Our final piece that day was <a href="https://youtu.be/M_Ld8JGv56E">We Shall Overcome</a> – the old spiritual that, with help from Pete Seeger, became a key anthem of the Civil Rights movement in the US. All the kids sang with us while Mark led the singing and joined in with his guitar. The whole room was filled with energy, optimism and promise. Mark said to me: “Tomorrow would have been Pete Seeger’s 99th birthday.” I remember replying: “That means we can celebrate his 100th birthday next year!”</p><p>That’s how our new album, Long Time Passing, had its beginning: as a 100th birthday tribute to a beloved performer who spent decades exploring the diversity of the world’s music and sharing it with many generations of audiences along the way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/19/pete-seeger-legacy-kronos-quartet-long-time-passing">Continue reading...</a>

Mr Z asked me what was on my bucket list.

I don’t want it to end. It is not as if we can break the two-metre rule when we each have our own trampoline.

<p>The bulbous-nosed reptiles were in critical decline until conservationists stepped in<br /></p><p>As the sunlight pierces the fog, a fisherman on a boat floating along the Gandak River in Bihar, India, spots a magnificent reptile basking on a sandbar in the middle of the river. Most people would mistake it for a crocodile but its distinctive snout tipped with a bulbous mass and elongated jaw tell him it is a gharial.</p><p>Gharials (<em>Gavialis gangeticus</em>) are often mistaken for crocodiles or alligators. They are the only species in the <em>Gavialidae</em><em> </em>family: river-dwellers that eat only fish and some crustaceans, and which split from all other crocodilians perhaps more than 65m years ago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/19/rising-tide-why-the-crocodile-like-gharial-is-returning-to-indias-rivers-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The area around London’s Olympic Park is a regeneration hothouse with micro-breweries, tech startups, speakeasys and spas. Now their spiritual needs are being met – with a beautiful chapel on a barge</p><p>A narrowboat moored to the towpath is offering passersby a “Shamanic ritual spa experience”. Its roof is decorated with an assortment of gongs, which are bonged occasionally by a man in a homemade cape. Across the water bobs a floating speakeasy cocktail bar that advertises a craft-beer-and-cheese-pairing cruise. Further along, diners are enjoying Szechuan aubergine with cashew cream in a Dutch barge that’s been converted into a restaurant. Beside it, a canoe hire company is running team-building paddleboarding expeditions.</p><p>As any Hackney Wick local will tell you, this corner of east London has changed drastically <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jul/21/london-2012-olympics-architecture-legacy">since the Olympic Games landed here in 2012</a>. And this shift hasn’t just affected the kind of boats moored along the towpath. The once gritty edgeland of car-breaking yards, slaughterhouses and mountains of knackered fridges has long been swept away, replaced with all the trappings of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/aug/06/olympic-legacy-street-art-graffiti-fury">hipster-infused regeneration</a>. Tech startups now rub shoulders with microbreweries, while fresh rows of new-build warehouse-style apartments are accompanied by novel floating lifestyle concepts. But the latest arrival to the Lee Navigation moorings takes a more unexpected form.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/19/floating-church-holy-vessel-salvation-hackney-hipsters-genesis-london-olympic-park">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The kind of war talk that helped get Brexit done is now proving useful in managing No 10’s calamitous Covid strategy</p><p>Consider this rule of thumb: the more that “patriotism” is invoked by a country’s political elites, the less healthy its political culture will be. From McCarthyism in the US to the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the imperative to love one’s country has often been used as a pretext for persecution and submission. And in post-Brexit pandemic Britain, we have developed our own grammar of patriotic intimidation.</p><p>The Conservative government is well positioned to play this game. It is already high on the fumes of Brexit, which carried the Tories to a majority that would allow them to vanquish Europe, take back control and get the job done. The Vote Leave veterans in No 10 are already aware of how well the language of treachery and sabotage can turn a section of the public against its own judiciary and even elected representatives.
