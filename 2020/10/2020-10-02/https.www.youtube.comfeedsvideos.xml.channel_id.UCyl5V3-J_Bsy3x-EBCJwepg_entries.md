Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk about the week’s biggest stories like it being revealed by the corporate press that Amy Coney Barrett is part of some weird religious cult that drinks blood, the nation’s libertarians cheering Trump’s smart avoidance of Federal theft, and a state without electricity now demanding everyone buy an electric car. 

Kyle and Ethan also react to the dumpster fire that is our nation’s presidential debate. 

Buckle your Chesterbelts, it’s another Babylon Bee News Show.
