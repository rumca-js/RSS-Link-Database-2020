And yet – seen through the timeline of Trump’s recent activities – it appears wholly unremarkable and perhaps even cosmically inevitable.

Because Matt Stone and Trey Parker give themselves permission to do whatever deranged shenanigans they please with each new episode, they’re free to cut through the interference and say what everyone’s thinking, no matter how uncouth. (Or at least, their notion of it.) Over the past four years and especially in the months since the Covid-19 pandemic began, the mainstream news media has utterly failed the American people on this precise front, as arbitrary codes of journalistic propriety have kept legacy publications from stating the obvious. While headline editors at the New York Times have found a thousand ways to phrase Trump’s untruths other than “lies”, the unshackled doofuses of South Park can show the current commander-in-chief flame-throwing humankind’s last hope for a cure because he’s noticed that the coronavirus seems to be predominantly killing people he dislikes.

The tea-brown, silt-clouded water of the Mekong appears, gliding beneath the prow of a little boat. Lines from the great poet <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1913/tagore/biographical/">Rabindranath Tagore</a>’s The Gardener lap the screen, concluding: “Why did the harp-string break? I tried to force a note that was beyond its power. That is why the harp-string is broken.”</p><p>Becoming Alluvium is a lyric poem in moving images that echoes the mythic passion of Tagore’s verse, its varying rhythms and its themes of love, care and oneness with the natural world.

But then the meeting happened and Holland’s heart sank, because the project turned out to be one about … fishing.</p><p>“I thought: I’m new on the job, the first thing on my to-do list was not going to be a show about two old guys going fishing together,” says Holland, before changing “old guys” to “older gentlemen” and then settling on “middle-aged” (Mortimer and Whitehouse are now 61 and 62).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/02/mortimer-and-whitehouse-gone-fishing-mens-health-male-friendship">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Prime minister’s latest policy initiative is a rehash that reflects a government short of ideas</p><p>David Nicholls is one of those authors that critics sometimes seem to underrate. Possibly because his novels always spend a long time on the bestseller lists. He doesn’t just have a sharp eye for story, his characters also have real depth and his books are a delicate balance between warmth and edge. No one ever gets too easy a ride. Us, which Nicholls has adapted into a Sunday night TV series – we’ve already binge watched all four episodes on iPlayer – is no exception. I can’t be the only bloke who saw the first five minutes and went into a cold sweat, wondering whether my wife was planning to tell me that our marriage was over because she now found me just a bit too dull and predictable. Before the coronavirus, my wife and I were both out at work during the week and had more of a social life at weekends, so I like to imagine that I may have appeared rather more interesting than I really am. Since March though, my wife and I have both been working from home and I can’t help feeling she must have noticed how boring I am because I do pretty much the same things every day. She did make a point of asking me during the second episode what big trip – other than a visit to Minneapolis to see our daughter – I would like to make before I died. My mind initially went blank, before hastily coming up with a ceramics tour of Japan. I think that was a good enough answer, so I may have earned myself a temporary reprieve. The other thing that has struck me about watching Us is how, even though it was filmed only last year, it seems like a different world with people taking travel and touch as normal. I wonder how soon it will be before we take them both for granted again when the pandemic is over.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/02/digested-week-boris-johnson-adult-learning-drive-back-to-90s">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The financial system is what’s driving the climate emergency. It needs a complete structural overhaul</p><p>It’s been a year of considerable blows to the fossil fuel industry. Thursday’s announcement that the University of Cambridge <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/01/cambridge-university-divest-fossil-fuels-2030-climate">will divest its endowment fund</a> from fossil fuel corporations is another considerable win for campaigners, who have spent many years doggedly demanding change from an institution that – despite being a global leader in scientific research and education – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jun/20/cambridge-university-rejects-calls-divest-fossil-fuels">has been obstinate</a> about severing its many ties to the fossil fuel industry, including significant research funding from Shell and BP.</p><p>Of course, serious questions will doubtless be raised about why a full decade is needed to shift money out of direct fossil fuel investments, and until 2038 to arrive at a “net-zero portfolio”. And the absence of a commitment on cutting the university’s close research ties with fossil fuel companies is also sure to draw some ire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/02/cambridge-fossil-fuels-divestment-fossil-fuels-climate-emergency">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Its nickname is ‘savage mountain’ – even the best ski mountaineers and guides thought it was impossible to attempt</p><p>I grew up in the countryside around Łętownia, Poland. It’s an area where skiing is popular, but my family were poor, so I had very old wooden skis; I didn’t even know modern equipment existed. I couldn’t afford to ride the ski lift, so I used to hike up with the skis strapped to my back. It turned out that this was good practice.</p><p>I was first introduced to ski mountaineering (climbing mountains, then skiing down them) by my older brother, who had represented Poland in the sport. He taught me to respect the mountains. From there, I started doing bigger and bigger challenges: Shishapangma in China in 2013, Manaslu in Nepal in 2014. Eventually, people around me wondered if I would take on K2.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/02/experience-i-skied-down-k2">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A brief, intense, but thoroughly welcome moment of minor magic</p><p><a href="https://www.maisonfrancois.london/">Maison François</a> is a new, Gallic-style, all-day brasserie close to Piccadilly Circus. In a godforsaken world, this feels like good news – or at least it does to me, because I consider the French all-day brasserie to be one of the high points of modern civilisation. It doesn’t live by earthly time constraints or dress codes; you can pitch up whenever, looking elegant or dishevelled. You can order a pichet of burgundy at 11am and the staff will treat you as if you’re <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/brigitte-bardot">Brigitte Bardot</a> in 1973, taking a breather from feeding donkeys at <a href="https://www.pinterest.com.au/dayliv/brigitte-at-la-madrague/">La Ma</a><a href="https://www.pinterest.com.au/dayliv/brigitte-at-la-madrague/">drague</a>.

He discusses his time in The Villages, a sprawling retirement community, which last year became infamous when a Donald Trump supporter was captured on video shouting “white power” during a confrontation. The president retweeted the video then deleted it after an online backlash. Laughland found residents who used to live harmoniously viciously divided by their support for Trump or Joe Biden.</p><p>Next stop was a thriving coffee shop: Conservative Grounds in Pinellas, which has been a bellwether county since 1980. Trump supporters were out in force: unafraid, empowered and organised. Laughland also discusses meeting Pinellas’s incumbent congressman, Charlie Crist. The Democrat says he has spoken to many people who voted for Trump in 2016 who now regret it. “They voted for Trump because they wanted radical change. And then they would say to me, ‘But not this radical; this is out of control.’” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/02/us-election-2020-an-ugly-fight-in-the-critical-swing-state-of-florida-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
