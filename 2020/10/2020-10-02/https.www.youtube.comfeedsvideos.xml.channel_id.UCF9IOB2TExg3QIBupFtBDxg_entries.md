COVID-19 Contact tracing, time

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/principles-contact-tracing.html
Recall everyone, infectious time frame
Contact tracing, warning exposed individuals (contacts)
Protect patient privacy, contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed
Contacts are provided with education, information, and support
Contacts are encouraged to stay home, 6 feet, 14 days
Monitor themselves by checking temperature twice daily
Watching for cough or shortness of breath
Contacts who develop symptoms should promptly isolate themselves and notify public health staff
Promptly evaluated for infection and for the need for medical care


ASSESSING THE AGE SPECIFICITY OF INFECTION FATALITY RATES FOR COVID-19: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, META-ANALYSIS, AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS (24th September)
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v5
Objective
Determine age-specific infection fatality rates
Methods
111 studies
33 locations
Results
Estimated age-specific IFRs
Very low for children and younger adults
Increase progressively
0.4% at age 55
1.3% at age 65
4.2% at age 75
14% at age 85
25% over 90
Discussion: 
Public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths. 
Seasonal flu
Influenza season of winter 2018–19 the U.S. 
~63 million infections
 34 thousand fatalities
Population IFR of 0·05%
