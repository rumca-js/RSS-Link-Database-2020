After years of development and multiple delays, CD Projekt Red's hugely anticipated open-world RPG Cyberpunk 2077 is almost here. With its November 19 release date rapidly approaching, we're diving deep into the lore of Cyberpunk, and this continues today with a new video focusing on the varied districts of Night City that you'll be exploring in your journey in Cyberpunk 2077.

Night City was planned to be the city to surpass all other cities, and the coastal Californian metropolis has certainly lived up to that reputation for better and worse. In the new video, Jess covers the seven main districts in Night City, including City Center, Watson, Westbrook, Heywood, Pacifica, Santo Domingo, and The Badlands.

As you'll see in the video, these locales are each varied and unique, giving players something new to see and do, no matter what their interests are. While there's plenty more details to be mined from the tabletop game Cyberpunk 2020, that should give you a pretty good idea of the regions you'll be questing through in Cyberpunk 2077. Check out the full video and let us know what you think!

As always, let us know what other lore topics you'd like to see covered in our next video, be sure to check out our previous episodes, and we'll see you again soon.

Cyberpunk 2077 launches on November 19 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC, while it will also release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.

This week on Generation Next, we answer your burning questions about the Xbox Series X, after our hands on with the brand new console.

There might not be much in the way of new revelations about the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 this week, but that just means we've got the perfect opportunity to bring in our tech expert Michael Higham, who has a working Xbox Series X, and ask him about his experiences with it.

On the last episode of Generation Next we asked you to submit your questions for Michael and, in this Xbox Series X special, we put them to him. Xbox Series X-related topics covered include the load times, and whether the improvement is significant enough to warrant an upgrade to the new Xbox. On top of that, we talk about how the Quick Resume feature works and whether it takes up any SSD space, whether cross-gen parties are possible, and if the Series X supports ultra-wide resolutions.

We also get to the bottom of how much freedom there is to dictate resolution and framerate performance, how the Series X controller stacks up in terms of input latency, and, of course, if it can run Crysis. 

Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.
