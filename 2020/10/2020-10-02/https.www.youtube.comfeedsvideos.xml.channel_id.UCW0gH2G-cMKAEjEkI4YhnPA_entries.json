In today's video, we explore their origins and their early battles with the Wainriders and their early alliance with Gondor.  In addition to their battles, we trace their homes from scattered settlements in Rhovanion to the Vales of Anduin, to the land in the far north, near the Grey Mountains that would be known as \u00c9oth\u00e9od.  The Lords of the \u00c9oth\u00e9od are known not only for their wars with Gondor against the Wainriders, but also for such deeds as slaying the dragon Scatha - an event which has a direct connection to the Scouring of the Shire in The Lord of the Rings.  In this video, and next week's, we will trace the ancestry of the Rohirrim to answer the question: Where did the people of Rohan come from?\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings! \n\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
