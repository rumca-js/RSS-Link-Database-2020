The Éothéod are the ancestors of the Rohirrim. In today's video, we explore their origins and their early battles with the Wainriders and their early alliance with Gondor.  In addition to their battles, we trace their homes from scattered settlements in Rhovanion to the Vales of Anduin, to the land in the far north, near the Grey Mountains that would be known as Éothéod.  The Lords of the Éothéod are known not only for their wars with Gondor against the Wainriders, but also for such deeds as slaying the dragon Scatha - an event which has a direct connection to the Scouring of the Shire in The Lord of the Rings.  In this video, and next week's, we will trace the ancestry of the Rohirrim to answer the question: Where did the people of Rohan come from?
