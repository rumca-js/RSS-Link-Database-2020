With its November 19 release date rapidly approaching, we're diving deep into the lore of Cyberpunk, and this continues today with a new video focusing on the varied districts of Night City that you'll be exploring in your journey in Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nNight City was planned to be the city to surpass all other cities, and the coastal Californian metropolis has certainly lived up to that reputation for better and worse. In the new video, Jess covers the seven main districts in Night City, including City Center, Watson, Westbrook, Heywood, Pacifica, Santo Domingo, and The Badlands.\n\nAs you'll see in the video, these locales are each varied and unique, giving players something new to see and do, no matter what their interests are. While there's plenty more details to be mined from the tabletop game Cyberpunk 2020, that should give you a pretty good idea of the regions you'll be questing through in Cyberpunk 2077.

Xbox Series X-related topics covered include the load times, and whether the improvement is significant enough to warrant an upgrade to the new Xbox. On top of that, we talk about how the Quick Resume feature works and whether it takes up any SSD space, whether cross-gen parties are possible, and if the Series X supports ultra-wide resolutions.\n\nWe also get to the bottom of how much freedom there is to dictate resolution and framerate performance, how the Series X controller stacks up in terms of input latency, and, of course, if it can run Crysis. \n\nGeneration Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.
