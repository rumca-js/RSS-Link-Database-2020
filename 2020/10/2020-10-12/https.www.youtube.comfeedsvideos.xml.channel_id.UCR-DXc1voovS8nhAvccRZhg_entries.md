This presentation was given at AnsibleFest Global 2020.

The presentation uses an example and explanation from Chapter 13 in my book, Ansible for DevOps: https://www.ansiblefordevops.com

I am uploading it to the YouTube channel since the platform where the session is stored is not all that easy to access after the fact. Here's the description from my session:

"Make sure you never commit a broken playbook using Molecule, Ansible, and GitHub Actions. Jeff Geerling discusses his CI workflows using GitHub Actions to manage hundreds of Ansible-based projects, including playbooks, roles, collections, and even Kubernetes Operators. Learn how Molecule makes developing and testing Ansible content easier, and how you can integrate it with GitHub Actions—or any other CI environment—for easy Ansible CI."
