All of this. Gone. And scientists are certain all of this will happen. On the bright side this isn\u2019t going to happen for 4-5 billion years. It makes me wonder: In a universe bigger than we can fathom, across eons of time, could\u2026 all of it end? Everything? The whole universe? Yes. And it probably will. Here\u2019s how.\n\nNote: The copy of \"The End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)\" discussed in this episode was provided free of charge by the publisher. As in \"the physical copy you see on screen.\" I also bought the book myself because I love astrophysics! But that version is on my Kindle :)\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Katie Mack \u25ba\u25ba https://twitter.com/AstroKatie \nCheck out Dr. Mack\u2019s new book \u201cThe End of Everything (Astrophysically Speaking)\u201d: https://amzn.to/3nFydVz  (Public library: http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1124333594 )\n\nFinally, we\u2019re on PATREON!
