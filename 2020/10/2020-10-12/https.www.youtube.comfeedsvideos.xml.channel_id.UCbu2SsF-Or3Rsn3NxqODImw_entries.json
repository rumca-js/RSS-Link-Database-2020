The series spans from Ancient Greece to the Viking Age to modern day, with players wielding tomahawks in Rome and slicing heads with hidden blades in Ancient Egypt. However, the age-old battle over magical, advanced technology is secretive and altogether more complex.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed tells an alternative history of the creation and development of human civilization, and it all ties back to an ancient, super-advanced species that ruled over Earth long before the Assassins and Templars even existed. Many Assassin\u2019s Creed games not only reference an alternate history, but also religions and figures from ancient civilizations like Greece, Egypt, and Italy. It seems possible the next installment in the series, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, could not only involve the Isu and Norse mythology, but also Norse pieces of eden, or a humanity-threatening event like Ragnarok. \n\nThe ways in which Assassin\u2019s Creed games weave together an alternative historical timeline with the ancient species that created humanity makes the series even more interesting to play and immerse yourself in. So in preparation for Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla next month, let\u2019s dive in and see where this massive series and the origin of humanity, all began.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQl37KNNfIY", "date_published": "2020-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Every Xbox Start Up Sound (2001 - 2020)", "description": "Here's every boot up sound for the Xbox from the 2001's original Xbox, all the way through to the upcoming Series X|S.\n\nWe're on the brink of a new console generation, as Microsoft is ushering in the Xbox Series X and S consoles in November.

The video shows off the exterior and interior of the box, the console, the controller, and the accessories. Another image found on Reddit showcased a retail-looking room with stacks of Xbox Series X boxes ready to be shipped.   The Series X and S launch on November 10th.\n\nPersia also goes over the new details from Insomniac's Instagram that tell us more about Spier-Man: Miles Morales. A Daily Bugle article talks about the city watching Miles train along the rooftops with Peter Parker. This tells us that Miles will have familiarity with his abilities before the game starts and Peter Parker could have a significant role in the game as Miles' mentor. We also got our first look at Miles' trademark hoodie costume, the same outfit he wore in Into the Spiderverse.\n\nLastly, Persia talks about a Dreamcast mini that could possibly be in the works. In a Famitsu interview translated by Siliconera, Sega creative producer Yosuke Okunari talked about the company's mini consoles and said, \"For the next Mini, we are considering everything that has been imagined by everyone. If I have to say some names, it could be an SG-1000 Mini or a Dreamcast Mini.\" The original Dreamcast was home to Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, and many more.\n\nThis is your Save State for Monday, October 12th.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxod-yEvD4g", "date_published": "2020-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "5 PlayStation Accessories You Forgot About", "description": "From the NeGcon to the PocketStation, there\u2019s a lot of weird accessories out there for the PlayStation.

But then there\u2019s a whole separate category of strange accessories. Like the PocketStation, or the NeGcon racing controller. You may already know them, forgotten about them, or didn\u2019t even know they existed in the first place.\u00a0\n\nWith the PS5 just around the corner, we wanted to look back at some of the more peculiar accessories that have come out over the years, some of which were exclusive to Japan like the I-Mode. Or others that were a bit more esoteric like Hori\u2019s Katana controller for Onimusha 3.

We show off a few different race types from Dirt 5's career mode, such as Icebreaker, Ultracross, and Land Rush. The career mode offers several styles of racing that require different types of vehicles as you progress through it. A podcasting duo also tells the story of your driver while in menus as you jump from one race to the next and build your reputation.\n\nOne thing to note is that this is a preview build and driver AI has not been properly tweaked yet. I was able to take first place in each race fairly easily with difficulty set to Very Hard, but we expect that to be tuned properly by the time it launches.\n\nDirt 5 has two enhancement options on the Xbox Series X. What you see in the video above is Image Quality mode, which prioritizes visuals and appears to be able to hit 60 FPS most of the time. However, there were some frame drops when dirt, snow, and other particle effects kicked up on screen. Frame Rate mode, of course, brings down visual quality to hit higher FPS more consistently--Dirt 5 is also one of the games that takes advantage of next-gen's 120FPS capabilities.\n\nMore coverage of the next-gen consoles is on the way, but for now, enjoy Dirt 5 gameplay on the Xbox Series X or check out my earlier hands-on Xbox Series X preview.\n\n0:00 Intro\n01:06 - Drifting on Ice In New York\n04:03 - Norway Career Mode Race\n08:23 - Snow Racing Career Mode", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xg1YUm6NUhk", "date_published": "2020-10-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "FIFA 21 Career Mode - 5 Big Changes", "description": "After years of community requests, a number of big changes have been made to Career Mode in this year's FIFA 21.

We have a demo build of it running on the Xbox Series X with some wild RPG gameplay and karaoke.\n\nAlthough it's the eighth mainline entry in the series, Yakuza: Like A Dragon starts a brand-new story with a cast of fresh faces. You take on the role of Kasuga Ichiban, a silly man with a heart of gold who was betrayed by the people he trusted most. He teams up with a few others to find the truth and explore the depths of Yokohama in modern-day Japan.\n\nYakuza: Like A Dragon is an Xbox Series X launch title, and we were able to access a demo build of the game and play it on our Xbox Series X preview unit. As of now, when running the game on Series X, you'll have a few enhancement options: high resolution mode for true 4K that runs the game at what looks to be around 30 FPS, and high framerate mode that brings down the resolution to run much higher FPS. In the video above, I set the visuals to Normal, and the game seemed to hold a consistent 60 FPS without sacrificing too much graphical quality.\n\nIn true Yakuza fashion, the charming absurdity shines through which you'll see in the karaoke minigame (and yes, Baka Mitai is back) and new turn-based RPG combat system. Our gameplay footage includes a bunch of ridiculous, but effective, special abilities that you can access from using the game's dynamic Job system. The demo dropped us in the middle of the story, but from what I can tell, the franchise's penchant for captivating drama seems to be intact.\n\nWe'll have more details on Microsoft's next-gen console soon, but for now, enjoy gameplay from the delightfully wild Yakuza: Like A Dragon or check out our earlier hands-on preview of the Xbox Series X.\n\n0:00 Intro\n00:53 Combat and Special Abilities Gameplay\n06:49 Karaoke Gameplay", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZprGqXMzY", "date_published": "2020-10-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
