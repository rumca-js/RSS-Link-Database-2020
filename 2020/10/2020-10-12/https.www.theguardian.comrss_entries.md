<p>Kulbir Sohi, whose Tranchee was second at York on Saturday, has urged racing’s rulers to crack down on whip offenders</p><p>Racing’s whip rules are once more to be the subject of heated debate, following the punishment meted out to Martin Harley for an obvious breach of them while winning on Gulliver at York on Saturday. Kulbir Sohi, owner of the runner-up, Tranchee, is outraged that a winner is allowed to keep the prize despite such significant rule-breaking and has written in complaint to the sport’s ruling body, urging a change in the rules and threatening legal action.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/12/enable-star-studded-racing-career-brought-to-an-end-by-retirement">‘She’s been a superstar’: tearful Dettori pays tribute to retired Enable</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/oct/13/talking-horses-owners-fury-over-winning-rivals-breach-of-whip-rules">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Ruling body claims talks were only ‘exploratory’ and ‘routine’</li><li>Exeter v Wasps final to be shown only by BT Sport</li></ul><p>Premiership Rugby is at the centre of another row, this time over television coverage of the Twickenham final between Exeter and Wasps on Saturday week. Until last week the BBC, having initially been approached by PRL’s chief executive, Darren Childs, had been preparing to show the game live to a broader terrestrial audience on BBC Two only to discover the “offer” had been withdrawn.</p><p>The situation has prompted irritation within BBC circles, with an entire outside broadcast unit and two prominent former England internationals having to be stood down at short notice. While BT Sport holds the primary broadcasting rights to the tournament, it would have significantly enhanced club rugby’s profile had the game been made widely available in a prime 6pm early-evening slot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/13/bbc-unhappy-as-premiership-rugby-drops-offer-to-show-twickenham-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Britain in the 1970s and 1980s was reflected, energised and transformed by the scintillating one-off dramas that the BBC put out. They still have plenty to teach us</p><p>The most disconcerting aspect of the BBC Four documentary Drama Out of a Crisis: A Celebration of Play for Today is that it makes it sound as if the 1970s and 1980s were history. Of course they weren’t – I was there, I remember them. They were … just life. But “the consensus politics that had governed the UK since the end of the second world war was unravelling”, Martina Laird’s voiceover informs us. “Britain was struggling with the end of empire.”</p><p>Time makes fools of us all, especially when you don’t notice it passing. Forty or fifty years ago is the past and, although we’re still technically in the same country, they did do things very differently there. They put on an original (usually) play every week on one of three mainstream channels, for a start, which garnered audiences of millions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/12/drama-out-of-a-crisis-a-celebration-of-play-for-today-review-when-the-play-really-was-the-thing">Continue reading...</a>

Mr Johnson has been outpaced by the virus for months while touting plans to defeat the disease. None have worked, which is why he is having to ask local leaders for help. The government now says every part of the country will be placed into one of three tiers of coronavirus restrictions – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/12/what-does-three-tier-covid-lockdown-system-mean-for-england" title="">medium, high alert or very high alert</a> – depending on the rate of infection.

<p>Leaked proposals contain both good and bad ideas, but Project Big Picture must be more than a licence to print money</p><p>Not many people seem to remember Benjamin Disraeli’s novels these days, partly because – by and large – they weren’t very good. Indeed, had their author not gone on to become one of the most important politicians of the 19th century, it’s likely they would have been almost entirely forgotten: a mixture of Byron-esque pastiche and half-baked political manifesto churned out largely to subsidise his extravagant London lifestyle. “When I want to read a novel, I write one,” Disraeli once claimed. Contemporary critics scoffed that it showed.</p><p>And yet for their many flaws, there’s some interesting stuff in there: the flesh and bones of the ideology he would take with him into office, a paternalistic conservatism whose influence over modern politics – even if only in motif – endures to this day. Disraeli deplores the widening gap between rich and poor. He chides the avarice of the ruling class and the thoughtless worship of wealth. He declares: “Power has only one duty – to secure the social welfare of the PEOPLE.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/12/project-big-pictures-offer-to-efl-clubs-you-will-be-looked-after-and-know-your-place">Continue reading...</a>

Forty of these were defined by Whitehall as most in need. The remainder were allegedly chosen by two ministers, Jenrick and his number two, Jake Berry. Most were marginal seats, all but one of which voted Tory at the subsequent election. They included Jenrick’s Newark and Berry’s Darwen, neither in the most needy category. (Newark was 270th.)

<p>Endless hours, home-surveillance, fear of reprisals – complaints in this already stressful industry have soared during Covid-19. We speak to distraught workers</p><p>For Maria Gomez, the nightmare began when she couldn’t get her boss out of her bedroom. “It felt like he was in there 24/7,” she says, “always watching my every move.” She was used to architecture’s punishing lifestyle, working late nights and weekends, and she had adjusted to the additional stresses of working from home during lockdown. But she hadn’t expected to be monitored via her computer webcam all day every day, with her meetings with clients secretly recorded by her bosses.</p><p>“I only realised I was being monitored when something I said was later quoted back to me in a team meeting,” she says. “And another recording of me was used in a presentation. It was completely insane. It felt like being back at school, with added hyper-surveillance.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/12/covid-19-lockdown-furlough-fraud-snooping-firings-architects-speak-out-exploitation">Continue reading...</a>

It’s been invaluable to me – whenever I’m redeveloping something, it will always be on my table for reference. It’s useful when you need the quantities for making a proper jus, for example, or the recipe for a perfect hollandaise, and for getting to grips with cooking terminology.</p><p><strong><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/madhur-jaffrey-s-world-vegetarian-9780091863647.html">World Vegetarian</a>, by Madhur Jaffrey <br /></strong><em><a href="https://melissahemsley.com/">Melissa Hemsley</a>, chef and cookbook author <br /></em>When I was about 19, I went to Devon with vegetarian friends who brought a battered copy of this book and started cooking from it. When we left, they forgot to take the book with them – so I kept it. It’s ginormous and has no pictures, which can be off-putting, but Jaffrey’s writing sucks you in and there are loads of great recipes you can make using everyday ingredients. I find her spicy punjabi red kidney bean stew very comforting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/12/every-page-makes-you-hungry-20-chefs-pick-their-favourite-starter-cookbooks">Continue reading...</a>

He had survived kidney cancer, a transplant and years of dialysis. He also had a seasonal sadness that overtook him eventually.

I have no idea why counting the months is reassuring, but it is. Also, how to keep track of the dozens of masks we have accumulated over the last seven months? Blue gauze masks, homemade and themed masks, Ikea and plumbing masks; we have dozens, which, despite our best efforts, are everywhere – and then nowhere when you need one.</p><p>Masks are the sharp pencils of 2020. They have also been largely unquestioned in Italy, a country where, normally, rules are obstacles to be overcome; a badly organised, badly governed country, apparently.

You can join a regiment like you can a football team and every battle has a theme. They’re often educational events for the public,” he says. “As well as the reenactment, we would show weapons from the period and talk to children.

If successful, it would mean replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a ferocious campaigner for women’s rights whose work turned her into a liberal icon, with Amy Coney Barrett, a deeply conservative judge whose values push in the opposite direction.
