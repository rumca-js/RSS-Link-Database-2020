Survival of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions
Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions (Lancet April)

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext

SARS-CoV-2 more stable on smooth surfaces

No infectious virus could be detected from smooth surfaces on day 4 (glass and banknote)

Overall, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly stable in a favourable environment

Susceptible to standard disinfection methods. 


The effect of temperature on persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on common surfaces (Virology Journal, 7th October)

Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness, Geelong, VIC, Australia

https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-020-01418-7

The rate at which COVID-19 has spread throughout the globe has been alarming

Role of fomite transmission is not yet fully understood

The risks of fomite transmission from contaminated surfaces.

This study measured the survival rates of infectious SARS-

CoV-2, on several common surface types

In the dark, (negate any effects of UV light)

20’C

Half-lives 1.7 to 2.7 days

Viral loads equivalent to the highest titres excreted by infectious patients

Viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20 °C from common surfaces 

Glass

Stainless steel

Paper and polymer banknotes

40’C

Virus survived less than 24 h at 40 °C on some surfaces

SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for significantly longer time periods than generally considered possible

These results could be used to inform improved risk mitigation procedures to prevent the fomite spread of COVID-19.

Exaggerated risk of transmission of COVID-19 by fomites (Lancet 3rd July)

https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(20)30561-2.pdf

In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small

Where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface
and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze (within 1–2 h)

I do not disagree with erring on the side of caution

Although periodically disinfecting surfaces and use of gloves are reasonable precautions especially in hospitals

Dynamic Change of COVID-19 Seroprevalence among Asymptomatic Population in Tokyo during the Second Wave (Tokyo and Boston)

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20198796v1.full.pdf

Population 127 million

Cases, 89,650

Deaths, 1,631

Fatality rates, low compared to Western Countries

Decreased despite the absence of lockdown 

? low infection prevalence

? low IFR

Seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees, Tokyo

May 26 to August 25

Healthy volunteer workers, n = 1,877 

IgM and IgG antibodies, test repeated at a month

Symptomatics excluded

Seroconversion

Seroreversion

Results

615 healthy volunteers received at least one test
 
Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over summer

Paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo

Exclusion of individuals with clinical symptoms, probable underestimation

Peaked on August 4

Peaked with the peak of the second wave

Out of the 350 individuals who completed both offered tests

21.4 % who tested seronegative became seropositive

Seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants

81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month 

IgM+/IgG- was the least common, 0.4% (3/700 total tests)

Short time frame between developing IgM then developing IgG

None of the seroconverted individuals were hospitalized or died

Conclusions

COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo

Despite the very low fatality rate

Temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases

we’re also working out actively how to deploy this and scale it up as well

because we want to hit the ground running once we’ve gotten our results
