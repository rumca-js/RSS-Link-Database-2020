Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nIn celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month, NPR Music presents four very special Tiny Desk (home) concerts recorded especially for this week.\n\nFelix Contreras | October 13, 2020\nColombian vocalist Lido Pimienta has had one of the musical highlights of a year marked by tragedy and uncertainty. The healing magic of her album Miss Colombia transfers beautifully to this visually stunning Tiny Desk (home) concert. (Extra points if you can spot the tiny Tiny Desk!)\n\nBacked up by a bevy of international musicians based in her new home of Toronto (I see you, members of the Cuban group Okan), you can hear for yourself how Pimiento's quartet of songs challenge the concept of just what qualifies as \"Latin music\" in a way that both honors and expands tradition.\n\nThere is added poignancy to the video; the visual theme is a quincea\u00f1era, a coming of age tradition that Pimienta could not share with her mother who had to flee Colombia. With her mom present at the video shoot, Pimienta uses her energetic performances to close a dramatic circle with her mom as we celebrate with her.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Eso Que Tu Haces\"\n\"Nada\"\n\"Coming Thru\"\n\"Resisto Y Ya\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nLido Pimienta: vocals\nOKAN (Elizabeth Rodriguez): vocals, violin\nMagdelys Savigne: vocals, percussion\nKaren Ng: saxophone, flute, clarinet\nTara Kannangara : trumpet\nFelicity Williams: vocals\nRobin Dann: vocals\nIsla Craig: vocals\nIvy Farquhar-McDonnell: vocals\nPrince Nifty: vocals, synthesizer\nBrandon Valdivia: percussion\nReimundo Sosa: percussion\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Andres Landau\nDirectors: Lido Pimienta, Andres Landau\nCinematography: Jack Weisman, Gabriela Osio Vanden, Rodrigo Michelangeli\n1st AC/Camera Operator:\u00a0Carine Zahner\nArt Direction: Gustavo Cerquera Benjumea\nEdited By: Andres Landau\nHair: Chason Yeboah \nMake-up: Marisa Tipkanok\nArt Department: Rosario Paz, Gustavo Cerquera Benjumea\nColor:\u00a0Zach Cox\nAudio By: Prince Nifty, Kvesche Bijons-Ebacher, Jarrett Bartlett\nProducer: Bob Boilen\nAudio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideo Producer: Maia Stern\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann\nPerformed and Recorded\u00a0at\u00a0Victory Social Club Studio in Toronto, Canada", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEnY43csEG0", "date_published": "2020-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
