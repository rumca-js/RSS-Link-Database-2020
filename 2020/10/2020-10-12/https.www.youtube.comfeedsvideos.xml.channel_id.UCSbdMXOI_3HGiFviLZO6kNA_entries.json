Welcome to my Oculus Quest 2 review. I have been sincerely enjoying my time with the Oculus Quest 2 and I can certainly sayb it a pretty fantastic VR headset. Is it an Index killer? OR Reverb G2 killer though? I don't think so. Is it the new king of VR? Well, it may sell the most, but it's not the best, however the value proposition is one I just cannot ignore. This headset is a review unit from Oculus but i can absolutely guarantee a review that only holds the bias of myself. \n\nBuy a Quest 2: (affiliate link)\nhttps://amzn.to/3lIftmM (256gb)\nhttps://amzn.to/371J1r6 (64gb)\n\nMy links:\n2nd Channel and Meetup video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZO_KOqt46Q\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nJoin my discord for good times\nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nPatreon link:Join\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nGAMERSUPPS Discount Code: THRILL\nhttp://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=thrill", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-ycDPkv-LE", "date_published": "2020-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
