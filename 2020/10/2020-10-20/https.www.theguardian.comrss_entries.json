has been moved to break with its own tradition over this year\u2019s election. Last time out, USA Today took sides for the first time, calling Republican nominee Donald Trump unfit for office, without offering an outright endorsement of Hillary Clinton. In 2020 they\u2019ve gone a step further. For the first time since it was founded in 1982, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/10/20/elect-joe-biden-reject-donald-trump-editorials-debates/5919435002/\"><strong>USA Today has endorsed a candidate for president \u2013 Joe Biden</strong></a>.</p><p>In an editorial they say is partially aimed at \u201cthose who [have] settled on Trump but might be having last-minute doubts,\u201d the editorial board writes:</p><p>Maybe you backed Trump the last time around because you hoped he\u2019d shake things up in Washington or bring back blue-collar jobs. Maybe you liked his populist, anti-elitist message. Maybe you couldn\u2019t stomach the idea of supporting a Democrat as polarizing as Clinton. Maybe you cast a ballot for a minor party candidate, or just stayed home.</p><p>Now, two weeks until election day, we suggest you consider a variation of the question Republican Ronald Reagan asked voters when he ran for president in 1980: Is America better off now than it was four years ago?</p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-10-20T10:50:59.710Z\">11.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>A Joe Biden victory in the presidential election alone may not be enough for him to get his policy programme into action \u2013 the Democratic party also need to make gains in the Senate.</p><p><a href=\"https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-senate-iowa-to-leans-democratic/\">Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball</a> this morning is suggesting that Iowa is one place that looks increasingly favourable for a Democrat gain \u2013 replacing North Carolina as the race likeliest to decide Senate control.</p><p>Incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst is looking increasingly like an underdog against her Democratic challenger, Theresa Greenfield. At the presidential level, Iowa is looking like a true toss-up, and Greenfield seems to be running at least even with \u2014 and often better than \u2014 Joe Biden in the state.</p><p>As of Monday, Greenfield\u2019s average lead in the RealClearPolitics average was 4.8%, while Biden was up by a more meager 1.2%. Perhaps tellingly, most of that difference comes from Ernst underperforming Trump \u2014 her average polling share stands at 42.5%, compared to Trump\u2019s 46.3%. So it makes sense that, despite his sagging national fortunes, Ernst generally is still trying to frame herself as a firm ally of the president.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/oct/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-elections-debate-coronavirus-covid-19-fauci-live-updates\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/oct/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-elections-debate-coronavirus-covid-19-fauci-live-updates", "date_published": "2020-10-20 11:05:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Nigel Slater\u2019s recipe for mushrooms, chickpeas, tahini", "description": "<p>Baked portobello mushrooms in a seedy, herby, spicy dressing</p><p>Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.

Biden wants to get a higher turnout among African American voters and he wants to try and win back white, working-class former Democrat voters. Biden is also looking for support from the suburbs, particularly college-educated women and men who are increasingly turning away from Trump, and seniors. Biden has been trying to take back the narrative by reframing the race as \u201ca campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue\u201d and polls currently have Biden leading in these battleground states. The president is also struggling to maintain control of states he won a bit more easily in 2016 \u2013 namely Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. If Trump loses Florida, where Biden has a marginal lead, it will be almost impossible for him to win the White House.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/audio/2020/oct/20/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-and-donald-trumps-possible-paths-to-power-podcast\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/audio/2020/oct/20/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-and-donald-trumps-possible-paths-to-power-podcast", "date_published": "2020-10-20 02:00:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Hundreds of Victoria hotel quarantine guests must be screened for HIV over blood testing contamination fears", "description": "<p>Authorities reveal blood glucose test devices were incorrectly used on 243 people, necessitating screenings for blood-borne diseases </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2020/oct/20/coronavirus-australia-live-updates-parliament-resumes-as-nsw-health-urges-more-covid-testing-politics-live\">Follow our liveblog</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/oct/12/victoria-coronavirus-map-melbourne-covid-19-cases-by-region-vic-case-numbers-data-trend-graph-rising-falling-corona-hotspots-areas-postcodes\">Victoria cases trend map</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/oct/12/coronavirus-australia-map-cases-covid-19-tracking-stats-live-data-update-by-state-suburb-postcode-how-many-new-active-case-numbers-today-statistics-corona-deaths-death-toll\">Full Australian Covid stats</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/12/melbourne-stage-4-restrictions-victoria-lockdown-rules-covid-19-stage-four-metropolitan-metro-explained-what-you-need-to-know\">Melbourne stage 4 restrictions</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/12/coronavirus-victoria-stage-step-3-restrictions-lockdown-victorian-regional-vic-covid-19-rules-stage-three-explained-what-you-need-to-know\">Vic stage 3 rules</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s coronavirus email</a></li></ul><p>More than 200 people who went through hotel quarantine in Victoria must be screened for HIV amid fears of cross-contamination from incorrect usage of blood glucose test devices.</p><p>Several such devices were used on multiple people in quarantine between 29 March and 20 August, necessitating screenings for blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis B and C and HIV.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/20/hundreds-of-victoria-hotel-quarantine-guests-must-be-screened-for-hiv-over-blood-testing-contamination-fears\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/oct/20/hundreds-of-victoria-hotel-quarantine-guests-must-be-screened-for-hiv-over-blood-testing-contamination-fears", "date_published": "2020-10-20 01:39:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Far-right online forum 8chan loses internet after protection services are cut", "description": "<p>Site was back online Monday morning with a Russian company enlisted to protect it from DDoS attacks</p><p>The latest incarnation of the hate-filled online forum 8chan was temporarily kicked off the internet on Sunday, after a company protecting the site from DDoS attacks cut its services.</p><p>The site, which is now called 8kun but was formerly known as 8chan, was back online on Monday morning, <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/10/qanon-8chan-sites-briefly-knocked-offline/\">security researcher Brian Krebs</a> reported, with a Russian company freshly enlisted to provide the protection services.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/19/far-right-online-forum-8chan-loses-internet\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/oct/19/far-right-online-forum-8chan-loses-internet", "date_published": "2020-10-20 00:55:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
