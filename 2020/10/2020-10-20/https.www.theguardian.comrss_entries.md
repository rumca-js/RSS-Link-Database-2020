<p>Australian has never let tennis rule her life and is as happy watching AFL at home as she is on court, but she will be back</p><p>Few sports have underlined their unimportance during the pandemic quite like tennis did in early October. As Roland Garros edged deeper into its first week, the top seed and tournament favourite , Simona Halep, was soaring. She ground through points, pumped her fist to the skies and demolished Amanda Anisimova to reach the fourth round. At that exact same moment 10,300 miles away in Queensland, Australia, the world No 1 and defending champion, Ashleigh Barty, was also on television, also pumping her fist. But in her playing hand <a href="https://twitter.com/AFL/status/1311998275768082432?s=20" title="">was a cool pint of beer</a>, not a tennis racket.</p><p>The last time Barty played competitively was at the Qatar Total Open in February, eight months ago. She decided initially to remain at home because of travel concerns stemming from Covid-19 but, as Australia grappled with the pandemic, the closed state borders meant she was unable to train with her coach, Craig Tyzzer. She chose not to defend her Paris title.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/oct/20/ashleigh-barty-happy-to-rest-up-while-retaining-world-no-1-status">Continue reading...</a>

In Sweden, summer is celebrated with the <em>kräftskiva</em> – a crayfish party that’s the highlight of any self-respecting Swede’s calendar. Held in early August, flagons of beer and chilled shots of liquor are served alongside freshwater crayfish, <em>Västerbottensostpaj</em> (a cheese flan) and plenty of rowdy singing. In keeping with the generous spirit of the <em>kräftskiva</em>, guests wear bibs and party hats, making for an unforgettably joyous celebration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/discover-swedens-delights/2020/oct/20/heres-to-cinnamon-bun-day-and-stinky-herring-10-things-you-need-to-know-about-swedish-food">Continue reading...</a>

Last time out, USA Today took sides for the first time, calling Republican nominee Donald Trump unfit for office, without offering an outright endorsement of Hillary Clinton. In 2020 they’ve gone a step further. For the first time since it was founded in 1982, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/opinion/todaysdebate/2020/10/20/elect-joe-biden-reject-donald-trump-editorials-debates/5919435002/"><strong>USA Today has endorsed a candidate for president – Joe Biden</strong></a>.</p><p>In an editorial they say is partially aimed at “those who [have] settled on Trump but might be having last-minute doubts,” the editorial board writes:</p><p>Maybe you backed Trump the last time around because you hoped he’d shake things up in Washington or bring back blue-collar jobs. Maybe you liked his populist, anti-elitist message. Maybe you couldn’t stomach the idea of supporting a Democrat as polarizing as Clinton. Maybe you cast a ballot for a minor party candidate, or just stayed home.</p><p>Now, two weeks until election day, we suggest you consider a variation of the question Republican Ronald Reagan asked voters when he ran for president in 1980: Is America better off now than it was four years ago?</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-10-20T10:50:59.710Z">11.50am <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p>A Joe Biden victory in the presidential election alone may not be enough for him to get his policy programme into action – the Democratic party also need to make gains in the Senate.</p><p><a href="https://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/the-senate-iowa-to-leans-democratic/">Sabato’s Crystal Ball</a> this morning is suggesting that Iowa is one place that looks increasingly favourable for a Democrat gain – replacing North Carolina as the race likeliest to decide Senate control.</p><p>Incumbent Sen. Joni Ernst is looking increasingly like an underdog against her Democratic challenger, Theresa Greenfield. At the presidential level, Iowa is looking like a true toss-up, and Greenfield seems to be running at least even with — and often better than — Joe Biden in the state.</p><p>As of Monday, Greenfield’s average lead in the RealClearPolitics average was 4.8%, while Biden was up by a more meager 1.2%. Perhaps tellingly, most of that difference comes from Ernst underperforming Trump — her average polling share stands at 42.5%, compared to Trump’s 46.3%. So it makes sense that, despite his sagging national fortunes, Ernst generally is still trying to frame herself as a firm ally of the president.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/oct/20/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-elections-debate-coronavirus-covid-19-fauci-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The show’s cast and creators discuss its evolution from British 90210 to taboo-busting teen TV, tackling everything from hard-hitting issues to laxative-spiked pizzas</p><p>A car breaks down and explodes, a shirtless teen ejects a floppy disk, the police give chase to a man on a motorbike and there is a fight over an empty milk bottle. All of this happens, wordlessly, in the first five minutes of the opening episode of Hollyoaks, broadcast on 23 October 1995.</p><p>Set in a fictional suburb of Chester populated by impossibly tanned and good-looking twentysomethings, the surreal and slightly camp first appearance on British TV screens of Channel 4’s youth-oriented series didn’t augur well. “Hollyoaks isn’t so much our first teen soap as a salute to British dentistry,” wrote the Guardian’s Stuart Jeffries in a review that described the show as “inept”. Yet, remarkably, this week it celebrates its 25th anniversary. In its quarter-century, it has managed to carve out a new form of British soap: aimed specifically at young people and addressing everything from drug overdoses to rape, radicalisation and domestic abuse, all at the teatime hour of 6.30pm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/20/real-life-but-better-looking-ultimate-teen-soap-hollyoaks-turns-25">Continue reading...</a>

I take half a tranquilizer with two glasses of a sparkling rosé, pull the weighted blanket over my cashmere pajama-clad body, and cue up the next episode of HBO Max’s new series A World of Calm.

He harvested a tree in a way that would cause as little damage as possible to the fragile ecosystem around him, and now he will hand-carve a canoe from its trunk. The forest is not on fire. It is being taken care of, by a Latvian man in a turtleneck. And now maybe I can find sleep.</p><p>If trees aren’t really your thing, there are other options on the first season of this streaming adaptation of a very popular mindfulness app. If you need to forget about the mass exploitation of children, migrants and other nations’ political autonomy for the sake of international agriculture, you can listen to Priyanka Chopra Jonas murmur to us about chocolate and the Mayan women who act as “protectors of the cacao”.

## The Spin | Cannonball Cricket: the indoor revolution that failed to take off

<p>Once hailed as the future and huge in Australia, for some reason the idea was not a hit. But it could be back in 2021<br /></p><p>It was in this week in 1985 that the Guardian first reported on a new form of indoor cricket, apparently set to take the nation by storm. A centre had opened in Wellingborough, another in Ipswich was following the week later and two courts at Lord’s were coming on stream the week after that, to add to venues already open in Hounslow and Peterborough. The ambition was for 150 indoor centres to open within three years. It was, according to Gordon Jenkins of the Lord’s indoor school, “wonderful for cricket”.</p><p>The following year the journalist Tim Heald published a book called The Character of Cricket, for which he travelled across England and Wales, talking to people involved in the game at various levels to establish a snapshot of the sport as it headed towards the final years of the century. “As far as cricket is concerned I think I may have seen the future,” he wrote of a visit to one of these centres. “I found it in a converted warehouse in Hounslow. This is the home of Cannonball Cricket – ‘It’s Fast! It’s fun! It’s for everyone!’ It was a warehouse, but now it is 25,000 square feet of indoor cricket ‘courts’. Its popularity is growing so fast that any claim made in this book will be out of date by the time it is published (unless I am hopelessly wrong and the whole thing has gone bust).” Colin Lumley, the Australian-born real tennis professional who managed the Hounslow centre, told the Times in 1985 “there are 250,000 Australians who play the game every week – and I think it will soon be as big here”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/20/the-spin-cannonball-cricket-indoor-revolution-that-failed-to-take-off">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Will Clayton Kershaw and Co end a losing streak in the October classic? Or will Tampa band of upstarts bring a title home to Florida? Our writers have their say</p><p><strong> </strong>Not to be crude, but if Los Angeles’ rally from a 3-1 NLCS deficit taught us anything about these Dodgers, it’s that their players have the balls to go along with management’s brains and ownership’s bucks. They are the complete package, and now that closer Kenley Jansen has ironed out his kinks, it’s going to be tough for the Tampa Bay Rays to overcome LA. That’s not a slight to the Floridians of course, who have shown yet again that at least dollar for dollar, they’re the best run organization in North American sports. With skipper extraordinaire Kevin Cash pulling the strings on his extremely talented, if not lesser known roster, they’ll push the LA to the very limit, and come up a buck short. <strong>Dodgers in seven. </strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/20/world-series-2020-will-the-rays-spring-a-surprise-over-the-dodgers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The TV show fan favourite who won hearts with his self-possession and sound advice has written a self-help book. How can we be more ‘dope’?</p><p>Months before Ovie Soko applied to be a contestant on hit reality show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island">Love Island</a>, he set himself a goal. “I’m a huge believer in manifesting stuff. You know – that if I write it down it will happen,” the 29-year-old says. “So I wrote in my journal: ‘Provide a service or a product that helps people feel better about themselves and it will reach millions of people.’ I hadn’t a clue how I was going to do that. So to go on to Love Island later and get<em> that</em> reception, well, it was nuts. Blew me away. Still does. I don’t really get it but nonetheless, I do appreciate it.”</p><p>Previously only known to basketball fans (at the time he was signed to Spain’s CB Murcia), Soko was instantly catapulted to fame. Almost overnight, he earned millions of fans who were struck by his self-possession and chilled personality in an environment where bravado and insecurities reign supreme. He became known for his wise words of comfort and advice to the other contestants, including pulling other men up on any disrespectful behaviour toward the women on the show (and there was a lot). It is in this vein that his debut book You Are Dope (subtitled “Let the power of positive energy into your life”) continues, offering guidance, advice, and inspiration on how to become the “dopest” person you can be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/20/ovie-soko-love-island-book-you-are-dope-it-takes-guts-to-live-by-your-internal-compass">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Arsène Wenger must despair at the inefficiency in the game, embodied by the German midfielder’s omission</p><p>There’s been something strangely disconcerting about seeing Arsène Wenger back on our screens, promoting his new book. Almost every interviewer he has faced has tried to lure him into some sort of indelicacy. Come on Arsène, settle some scores. Shit-talk Mourinho. Shit-talk Arteta. Shit-talk the board. Give us the full-body contact. Yet by and large, Wenger has refused to dance. His book is restrained, measured, high on facts and light on gossip, and has thus inevitably been panned as a crushing disappointment. Occasionally, however – much like his teams – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/20/arsene-wenger-a-sense-of-anger-humiliation-hate-every-defeat-is-still-a-scar-on-my-heart">he can still produce a moment of pure transcendence</a>.</p><p>On Friday night, Wenger was a guest on the Graham Norton Show, where he explained why footballers need a coach. “When people come together, it creates a magic,” he answered. “Sometimes the energy gets together, and they go up to a level where it becomes art. The art of flying together.” It was a beautiful, succinct image: his life’s mission, boiled down for a prime-time BBC One audience. Naturally, Norton quickly changed the subject to Wenger banning Mars bars. Freddie Flintoff told a story about drinking pints. The audience roared. Later, when the show’s Facebook page posted a clip from the programme, the one they chose was: “Arsène Wenger on his iconic fight with José Mourinho.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/20/the-absurdity-of-mesut-ozil-arsenal-exile-yet-another-top-talent-cut-adrift">Continue reading...</a>

## Trio by William Boyd review – lights, camera, chaos

<p>The secret lives of three characters on a 1960s film set make for the novelist’s funniest book in years</p><p>WH Auden said of TS Eliot that three different figures coexisted within him: a conscientious churchwarden, a screaming peasant woman and a mischievous 12-year-old boy. Much the same is true of William Boyd, whose novels have consistently left readers wondering who the “real” author is. Some of his comic writing suggests a kinship with Evelyn Waugh as a <em>farceur </em>of rare talent, but other books hint that he is a very un-English talent indeed, as befits his upbringing in Ghana, Nigeria and Scotland. For all his skill at constructing page-turning narratives, there is an ostentatious delight in game-playing that almost makes him the novelistic equivalent of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/04/tom-stoppard-a-life-review-smuggling-heart-into-a-scholars-story">Tom Stoppard</a>.</p><p>That was especially true of his last book, the excellent <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/03/love-is-blind-william-boyd-review">Love </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/03/love-is-blind-william-boyd-review">Is Blind</a></em>, which filtered Chekhovian pathos through a postmodern take on the Scottish Enlightenment genre, and continues to be the case in this, his 16th novel. Set in 1968, <em>Trio </em>revolves around three stories, connected by the Brighton production of a terrible-sounding film called Emily Bracegirdle’s Extremely Useful Ladder to the Moon<em>.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/20/trio-by-william-boyd-review-lights-camera-chaos">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Men are shamed into hating anything feminine in themselves and in the world, and if they dare question that hatred, they are forced to relive the shame</p><p>In a recently resurfaced 2007 interview from The Ellen Show, Ellen Degeneres is shown upbraiding guest Celine Dion for allowing her then six-year-old son to grow his hair long. “He is beautiful,” Ellen says, “but look at that hair! When are you gonna cut that hair?” Initially, Dion’s feathers get ruffled (“Do you have a problem with that?” she shoots back) but ultimately she seems hesitant to take anything resembling a political position. What’s more surprising is Ellen’s policing of gender expression here – particularly when considering that she herself is a gay woman who openly flouts gender norms.</p><p>But patriarchy and its prerogatives<strong> </strong>are not solely the province of men. Women can and often do claim them – just as any disenfranchised group will do what they can to cling to power. Throughout my childhood, I watched my own mother turn male prerogatives against herself without realizing it. There was an invisible line she would never cross, and I learned not to cross it either.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/20/leaving-my-perfect-male-body-in-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

Last year he was named “Hollywood’s most bankable star”, with films grossing a <a href="https://twitter.com/THR/status/1083000545495916549">total of $13bn</a> to date – more than the annual GDP of Iceland. The New York Times has described him as “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/magazine/how-samuel-l-jackson-became-his-own-genre.html">his own genre</a>”.</p><p>And yet, despite having one of the most recognisable faces on the planet, until recently Jackson didn’t know quite where that face had come from. Like many African Americans, he was descended from people who were enslaved, leaving a question mark over his origins. That was until he embarked on a process of genealogy and DNA testing, which led him back to Gabon’s Benga tribe. “A lot of people tried to trace themselves and find out where they came from – all they could find out was maybe a country,” he explains. “So to go through what I went through – to find out what tribal ancestry I had and to be able to step back into – it was a really emotional, satisfying feeling. There’s a fullness that comes upon me, every time I land in Africa. As I step on the ground, everything sort of changes”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/20/samuel-l-jackson-interview-enslavement-africa-roots-race-latanya-richardson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lauren Gambino, political correspondent for Guardian US, discusses which states Biden will need to win to take the White House, and what Trump will need to do to retain the presidency</p><p>What matters on 3 November is not which candidate gets more votes in the US election, but who secures the 270 electoral college votes needed to get to the White House. <strong>Lauren Gambino</strong>, political correspondent for Guardian US, talks to <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about Joe Biden and Donald Trump’s possible paths to power.</p><p>In 2016, Trump pulled off a shock victory by becoming the first Republican presidential candidate in 28 years to win Michigan, Pennsylvania or Wisconsin - but by razor-thin victories says Lauren. Biden wants to get a higher turnout among African American voters and he wants to try and win back white, working-class former Democrat voters. Biden is also looking for support from the suburbs, particularly college-educated women and men who are increasingly turning away from Trump, and seniors. Biden has been trying to take back the narrative by reframing the race as “a campaign between Scranton and Park Avenue” and polls currently have Biden leading in these battleground states. The president is also struggling to maintain control of states he won a bit more easily in 2016 – namely Florida, Arizona and North Carolina. If Trump loses Florida, where Biden has a marginal lead, it will be almost impossible for him to win the White House.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/audio/2020/oct/20/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-and-donald-trumps-possible-paths-to-power-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
