manuscript)\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1517/5917611\n\nWhat is the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on the human skin?\n\nWe evaluated the stability of:\n\nSARS-CoV-2\n\nInfluenza A virus (IAV)\n\nMixed with culture medium or upper respiratory mucus\n\nResults:\n\nSARS-CoV-2 became inactive in 9.4 hours\n\nIAV became inactive in 1.82 hours\n\nBoth became inactive more quickly than on other surfaces (stainless steel/glass/plastic)\n\nBoth became inactive in 15 seconds, on skin, with 80% ethanol\n\nConclusions: \n\nThe 9-h survival of SARS-CoV-2 on human skin may increase the risk of contact transmission in comparison with IAV\n\nthus accelerating the pandemic\n\nProper hand hygiene is important to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2
