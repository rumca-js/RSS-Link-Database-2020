The scene represents the fall of a section of wall in a factory.” As workers carry wheelbarrows of rubble, a wall topples and collapses in a cloud of dust. The workers then return to clear the debris.

Auguste Lumiere is acting for his brother who is operating the camera. This movie became famous at the time, because during projection there was an accident that changed completely how the audience reacted. Instead of rewinding film with the projector turned off, they did it with a lamp on and projecting it on the screen. Unintentionally it was shown to the audience backwards. Instead of demolition, they saw how the wall was rebuilt from a cloud of dust. It's easy to imagine the impact on the viewer of the time. The next day Lumiere brothers were called "sorcerers" by workers at their factory.

Auguste Lumière and his wife Marguerite are feeding their daughter Andrée. Auguste's brother, Louis, is operating the camera. Action takes place in Lyon, Monplaisir (France) at Lumière house.

This was one of the first films by the Lumiere brothers. After the first projection on June 10, 1895 in Lyon, the audience was most impressed by the movement of the leaves. So far they have only seen static images. This was a huge breakthrough for the world of cinematography.
