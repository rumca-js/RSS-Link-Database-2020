Mary Lucia talks with Cecilia Johnson, producer of The Current Rewind podcast.

The Current Rewind is the podcast putting music's unsung stories on the map. In season two, the program traces the 50-year history of Minneapolis club First Avenue, using 10 pivotal dates to explore how a city, a scene, and popular music have evolved since the dawn of the '70s. Mary and Cecilia talk not only about what happens behind the scenes of making this podcast, but also about First Avenue's past, present and — we certainly hope — future.
