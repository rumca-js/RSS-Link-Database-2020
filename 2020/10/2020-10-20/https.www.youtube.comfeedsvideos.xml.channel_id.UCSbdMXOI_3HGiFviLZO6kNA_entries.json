Your number one resource for the entire weeks worth of VR news. Today I have have something kind of serious to talk about, all of these happenings with Oculus users getting their accounts banned recently even if they have a legit account through Facebook. I am not sure how widespread the issue is, or if it's effecting dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of users, but the mass reports are available all over the internet to see. Here's at least some advice on how to NOT get banned.  \n\nAlso, new omnidirectional treadmill stuff, as well as some pretty good Pimax news. \n\nMy Links:\n2nd Channel and Meetup video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZO_KOqt46Q\nhttps://www.twitch.tv/thrilluwu\nJoin my discord for good times\nhttps://discord.gg/thrill\nPatreon link:Join\nhttps://www.patreon.com/Thrillseeker\nGAMERSUPPS Discount Code: THRILL\nhttp://gamersupps.gg/?afmc=thrill\n\n\nSources:\noutro music: Protostar- Overdrive Instrumental\nFeetSaber: https://uploadvr.com/feetsaber-beat-saber-feet/\nLSToast: https://twitter.com/LSToast/status/1317628381186412544\nQuest 2 paperweights: https://uploadvr.com/facebook-response-to-quest-paperweights/\nhttps://uploadvr.com/facebook-account-quest-paperweight/\nhttps://www.virtuix.com/\nhttps://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-quest-2-decoy-box-iron/\nomotea feetsaber: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSXJ-TJhuQo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLhIEVMc9qI", "date_published": "2020-10-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
