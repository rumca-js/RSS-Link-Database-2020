Xbox Series X|S-exclusive Scorn draws its inspiration from H.R. Giger's work on the Alien franchise and the surreal art of Zdzisław Beksiński. Watch the unsettling and horrifying results in this exclusive 13-minute gameplay video.

Ebb Software's Scorn is a dark and grotesque horror-adventure game set within a bio-mechanical labyrinth. It was first revealed in 2016 and is a narrative-driven FPS that combines grotesque body-horror and action gameplay with the bizarre and nightmarish imagery from H.R. Giger's work on the Alien franchise.

Scorn will launch on PC and for the Xbox Series X|S as a next-gen console exclusive, with a planned release set for sometime in 2021. Ebb Software has now revealed more of what's to come with the game, showcasing a near-final look at the horror game.

In the gameplay video, there's a sense that Scorn aims to put players in a state of confusion, which, based on the gameplay, intensifies over time. The imagery shown off in this video is extremely weird, but it's still interesting--especially for fans for enjoyed the Alien series.

According to the developers, as well as taking direct inspiration from H.R. Giger, it also draws upon the works of surrealist artist Zdzisław Beksiński. The result is something that is designed to put you in a constant state of discomfort, but still leaves you eager to delve deeper into its world.

Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be optimized on Series X & S, you can now stream your Xbox One games to your iPhone or iPad, and Cyberpunk 2077 will have full lip-sync for all its supported languages.

In your Save State for October 20, Chastity tells you about how Halo: The Master Chief Collection is getting Xbox Series X & S optimizations such as support for 120 FPS and up to 4K.

Speaking of Xbox games, the Xbox app on iOS just got an update that lets you stream games from your Xbox One console to your iPhone or iPad. You'll be able to do the same for the Series X and S when they launch, but it doesn't work with backwards-compatible Xbox 360 and original Xbox games. This is distinct from Microsoft's xCloud service.

In Cyberpunk news, 2077 will have lip-sync animations in all 10 of the game's supported languages. The feat was achieved in collaboration with Jali Research Inc., which helped streamline the massive animation process.

## Cold War's Fireteam: Dirty Bomb Needs Some Improvements

Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War’s new Fireteam: Dirty Bomb is a bit of a mess and that’s exactly what betas are for.

As part of the second Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War beta, we got to try the brand-new multiplayer mode Fireteam: Dirty Bomb. Fireteam is its own game type and Treyarch indicated more modes will be added over time. In Dirty Bomb, four teams of ten players run around two maps collecting uranium and arming five bomb sites. When bombs detonate, that area of the map fills with radiation forcing teams to other locations. After all bombs detonate the map resets and players continue to accrue points until one team wins. The mode also has a number of drivable vehicles including dirt bikes, snowmobiles, and attack helicopters. 

Dirty Bomb adds some systems from Infinity Ward’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare and Warzone battle royale mode. This includes crates containing killstreaks, an armor plate system, a ping communication system, functional doors, and a respawn system with both squad spawn and parachuting. In this video, we go over what is and is not working with Dirty Bomb.  

Call of Duty: Blacks Ops Cold War releases on November 13 on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. It is also coming to next-gen consoles PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Series S.

## The Best Xbox Series X/S External Storage Solutions

What looks to be one of the biggest issues of next-gen consoles will be limited storage space. We break down the best solutions to solve this without breaking the bank or your data cap.

The Xbox Series X comes with a 1TB internal SSD and with the size of games today, that can fill up fast. It's also worth mentioning that the Series S only has a 512GB drive. So, you'll probably be looking for ways to expand the storage capacity for your new Xbox console at some point. And we have some solutions for you.

Microsoft is offering a 1TB expansion card from Seagate which works identically to the internal SSD. It's built to take advantage of the same speeds, and it slots right into the back of the console. While it's the best performing solution, it's relatively expensive at $220 (which is fair for NVMe SSDs). You can also use external USB drives, though there are some conditions you'll need to be aware of.

You can still use the Quick Resume game-swapping feature for games running off of USB drives. But keep in mind that USB drives can only play Xbox One, Xbox 360, and original Xbox backwards compatible games. You can store Series X/S games on a USB drive but they need to be transferred to the internal storage or Seagate expansion card in order to be played.

So, for external drive testing, we used a Samsung T5 portable SSD through USB 3.1--the data transfer speeds were quite fast and load times were very close to the internal SSD. The Samsung T5 is also much cheaper than the Seagate expansion card. Using the Western Digital My Passport, a traditional external hard drive with USB 3.0, things slowed down as expected, but it wasn't too bad. Transfer speeds were reasonable and load times were a bit better than what they were on the Xbox One X. And if you want bulk storage for cheap, this is the route you'll probably want to go.

You can get details on how we tested drives, our specific results, and our advice for storage options by watching the video above. Be sure to check out our full Xbox Series X preview where we dive deep into performance, graphics upgrades, load times, Quick Resume, and much more.

## You Can't Play P.T. On PS5 | Save State

On today's Save State, Persia talks about P.T. not being playable on the PS5, the PS5's fan being optimized over time, and the Black Ops Cold War beta being extended for another 24 hours. 

In this video, Persia talks about P.T. not being downloadable on the PS5. Since it cannot be downloaded, that means it also won't be backwards compatible. PT was removed from the PlayStation Store in 2015 and Silent Hills fans are still clamoring for a reboot 5 years later, but back in March, Konami confirmed that it's just not happening.

Persia also talks about the PS5 fan being optimized over time. Sony will collect data from the fan's Accelerated Processing Unit, allowing the fan to run at different speeds depending on what's necessary for whatever game you're playing at that time.

And lastly, Persia talks about the Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War beta being extended for another 24 hours to all players on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. PS4 players don't need PlayStation Plus to try it, but you do need Xbox Live Gold for the Xbox version and a Battle.net account for PC. All attachments are unlocked and there's now Double XP. The beta has Team Deathmatch, Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, Control, and the new Combined Arms and Dirty Bomb modes. Black Ops Cold War will be available on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Series X, Series S, and PC on November 13.

This is your Save State for Monday, October 19th.
