The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | October 9, 2020
Wayne Coyne has appeared inside a bubble for over a decade. At concerts, he'd roll over the tops of adoring fans, their outstretched hands keeping him aloft. That was novelty long ago; now it seems prescient. For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, Wayne and his bandmates are seemingly quarantined from one another, with the bubble-sharing green-haired drummers and keyboards pairing off, playing together yet apart.

I don't think it's a stretch to say that going to a Flaming Lips concert stoned is a thing. The Flaming Lips have always embraced the surreal. Drugs are undoubtedly part of the culture, and on their new songs from American Head, drugs are at the core. These are songs for the lost, the overdosed dreamers, the damaged, the car crashed. On the album's opening track "Will You Return/When You Come Down" (which also begins this concert), Steven Drozd asks in falsetto, "Will you return? Will you come down?" while Wayne Coyne responds, "Thinking back to those lost souls / And their ghosts / Floating around your bed / Hear it said / Now all your friends are dead."

This visually enchanting Tiny Desk comes down to earth, with technical glitches that are fun to witness and keep it real.We hear old tunes sparking old memories, including "Be Free, A Way" from 2013's The Terror and "It's Summertime" from 2002's Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots. It's a thoughtful treat from a band that keeps on giving.

## The Conspiracy Against Hip-Hop | Louder Than A Riot, S1E1

In this first episode of "Louder Than A Riot," a mysterious conspiracy letter sends us on a journey to find out just how entangled hip-hop and mass incarceration have become over the last 40 years. 

In 2012, an unsigned letter began circulating on popular hip-hop blogs, describing a meeting that allegedly happened 20 years earlier between private prison and music industry executives. According to this letter, record execs were asked to begin marketing and promoting hip-hop that glorified criminal behavior in exchange for stock in the prison business. What does this conspiracy theory suggest about the relationship between hip-hop and America's prison system? 

In this episode, we examine the history of policing and the music industry's complicity with hip-hop OGs Too Short and Killer Mike, break down iconic songs like "The Message" and "6 'N the Mornin'," flip through the pages of The Source's Behind Bars issue with former editor-in-chief Kim Osorio and go inside the mind of retired NYPD "hip-hop cop" Derrick Parker. All this to unveil how the justice system disproportionately affects Black America, and what hip-hop, as America's most consumed music genre, has always done to push back.

WHAT'S "LOUDER THAN A RIOT"?
Rhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. "Louder Than A Riot" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles — the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.
