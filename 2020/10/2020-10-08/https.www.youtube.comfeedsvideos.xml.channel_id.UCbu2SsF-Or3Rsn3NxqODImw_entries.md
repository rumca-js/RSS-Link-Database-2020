## Genshin Impact vs. Zelda: Breath of the Wild - 20 Biggest Similarities

While Genshin Impact shares many elements of Breath of the Wild such as cooking and shrines, other parts of the game stand out heavily as something pulled directly from Breath of the Wild. Here are our favorite picks of the most significant similarities.

Genshin Impact looks a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, to the point that plenty of folks immediately compared the two when Genshin Impact was first announced. But the similarities between the two games is more than skin-deep--both share a few mechanics and features, as well.

In the video above, Max Blumenthal shows off these similarities, ranging from how the characters move and attack to what types of puzzles are found in both games. Genshin Impact even manages to take inspiration from Breath of the Wild's Champion Abilities, as three of the RPG's characters possess powers that closely resemble Daruk's Protection, Revali's Gale, and Urbosa's Fury in both appearance and utility. 

Which isn't to say that Genshin Impact is an exact copy of Breath of the Wild; it's just heavily inspired by Nintendo's opus. As Max explains in another video, Genshin Impact builds upon what Breath of the Wild does, utilizing the mechanics and features of an open-world action game to amplify its RPG gameplay.

Created by Chinese developer Mihoyo, Genshin Impact is a free-to-play, open world RPG available for PC, PS4, and mobile devices (a Switch port is in the works as well). The game sees you play as an evolving party of different characters, each of whom can command one of the world's elements. You can unlock new characters by playing the game or pay real-world money to participate in the gacha mechanics--basically a randomized loot box.

PlayStation 5 isn’t just a stylish looking console, it also packs a lot of pretty sweet new features. Here are 7 of the newest and coolest things the PS5 is bringing to this generation of gaming.

Along with its stylish spaceship exterior, the PS5 is bringing a lot of cool new features into this generation of gaming. 

The DualSense controller alone is packing in a bunch of interesting new features, taking immersion a step forward with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers, not to mention the welcome addition of a built-in microphone. These are all features that games like Astro’s Playroom, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Arkane’s Deathloop will be taking full advantage of. 

Controller aside, there’s also new emphasis on its Tempest 3D AudioTech, which the PS5’s Pulse 3D wireless headset are built especially for. Developers like Capcom are excited to use spatial sound to emphasize the horror of Resident Evil Village. Now you'll be able to hear a werewolf breathing heavily behind as you run for your life. Lovely.
 
Beyond the gameplay immersion, there’s also a lot going on under the hood of the PS5 too, like its new cooling system, or its ability to take full advantage of an SSD for improved load times. There’s a lot, so in this video we’re taking a look at seven of the coolest features Sony is bringing to the table with the PlayStation 5.

On today's Save State, Persia talks about the upcoming changes to PS5's trophy system, Microsoft poking fun at Sony over rotating the Series X, and Destiny 2: Beyond Light's exotic weapons and gear being revealed.

In this video, Persia talks about a since-deleted blurb from a French PlayStation Blog post that mentions a trophy tracking system coming to the PS5 along with additional updates coming to the PS4 this week. This means you'll now know your exact progress for individual trophies for compatible PS5 games. Other trophy system changes include an update to icons and the level cap being upped to 999. Current trophy levels will scale to a comparable level after the update and will not impact any trophies you've already earned. 

Persia also talks about Microsoft poking fun at Sony after its teardown video, because you'll have to do a bit of adjusting to turn the console on its side. A cheeky tweet from Xbox showed how you can simply rotate the Series X onto its side because of its box shape. 

Lastly, Persia talks about some of the Exotic weapons and gear that were revealed for Destiny 2: Beyond Light. The Cloudstrike, Lament, Dawn Chorus, and Icefall Mantel are just a few of the new items featured, and they all have their own special effects that benefit their respective classes. 

This is your Save State for Wednesday, October 7th.

Bugsnax is a PS5 launch game set on an island populated by edible creatures inspired by Pokemon and Apocalypse Now. Tony and Phil explain what the hell that actually means.

When Bugsnax debuted during the Sony PS5 reveal event, we had lots of questions. What are these little edible creatures? What's happening on this island? Why is the theme song so damn catchy? 

We don't have all the answers yet, but we did get some hands-on time with the game, and it might be darker than its cute look suggests. Tony and Phil discuss this in the video above, talking about the game's influences, voice talent, and more. 

Bugsnax releases for PS5, PS4, and PC on November 12. It joins the growing list of confirmed PS5 launch games.
