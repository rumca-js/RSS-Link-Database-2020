Here are our favorite picks of the most significant similarities.\n\nGenshin Impact looks a lot like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, to the point that plenty of folks immediately compared the two when Genshin Impact was first announced. But the similarities between the two games is more than skin-deep--both share a few mechanics and features, as well.\n\nIn the video above, Max Blumenthal shows off these similarities, ranging from how the characters move and attack to what types of puzzles are found in both games. Genshin Impact even manages to take inspiration from Breath of the Wild's Champion Abilities, as three of the RPG's characters possess powers that closely resemble Daruk's Protection, Revali's Gale, and Urbosa's Fury in both appearance and utility. \n\nWhich isn't to say that Genshin Impact is an exact copy of Breath of the Wild; it's just heavily inspired by Nintendo's opus. As Max explains in another video, Genshin Impact builds upon what Breath of the Wild does, utilizing the mechanics and features of an open-world action game to amplify its RPG gameplay.\n\nCreated by Chinese developer Mihoyo, Genshin Impact is a free-to-play, open world RPG available for PC, PS4, and mobile devices (a Switch port is in the works as well). The game sees you play as an evolving party of different characters, each of whom can command one of the world's elements. You can unlock new characters by playing the game or pay real-world money to participate in the gacha mechanics--basically a randomized loot box.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ooAfSSn5V4", "date_published": "2020-10-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Series X|S - Power Your Dreams Launch Trailer", "description": "Introducing the all-new Xbox Series X|S.

These are all features that games like Astro\u2019s Playroom, Marvel\u2019s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Arkane\u2019s Deathloop will be taking full advantage of.\u00a0\n\nController aside, there\u2019s also new emphasis on its Tempest 3D AudioTech, which the PS5\u2019s Pulse 3D wireless headset are built especially for. Developers like Capcom are excited to use spatial sound to emphasize the horror of Resident Evil Village. Now you'll be able to hear a werewolf breathing heavily behind as you run for your life. Lovely.\n\u00a0\nBeyond the gameplay immersion, there\u2019s also a lot going on under the hood of the PS5 too, like its new cooling system, or its ability to take full advantage of an SSD for improved load times.

This means you'll now know your exact progress for individual trophies for compatible PS5 games. Other trophy system changes include an update to icons and the level cap being upped to 999. Current trophy levels will scale to a comparable level after the update and will not impact any trophies you've already earned. \n\nPersia also talks about Microsoft poking fun at Sony after its teardown video, because you'll have to do a bit of adjusting to turn the console on its side. A cheeky tweet from Xbox showed how you can simply rotate the Series X onto its side because of its box shape. \n\nLastly, Persia talks about some of the Exotic weapons and gear that were revealed for Destiny 2: Beyond Light.
