<p>Scotland had not been involved in extra time since 1961. They have not competed in a major tournament since 1998. On an evening where the first of those runs was broken, the second came to within a game of potentially ending. A penalty shootout success over Israel took Steve Clarke’s team to the Euro 2020 qualifying play-off finals. The Scots slotted home all five of their spot-kicks, with Kenny McLean the man to seal victory. David Marshall’s earlier save from Eran Zahavi was equally significant.</p><p>In a match which soon regressed into an ugly scrap, the Israel substitute Shon Weissman was inches from snatching glory with four minutes to play. In the final act of extra time, Scotland’s Liam Cooper hit the post with a header.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/08/scotland-israel-euro-2020-play-off-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Britain’s north-south split never went away. Now it is being supercharged by the ravages of the pandemic</p><p>Boris Johnson’s hopes of containing the second wave of Covid-19 through local lockdowns have failed. The failure has many causes, some of which are deep-seated. The fact of failure is, though, not in doubt. Covid cases in Britain rose by a shocking 17,540 on Thursday. The test-and-trace system recorded its lowest <a href="https://twitter.com/PA/status/1314202134737350657" title="">daily contact rate</a> since the pandemic began. Hospitals are warning that they could be overwhelmed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/08/whitty-covid-icu-cases-in-northern-england-could-pass-peak-in-22-days" title="">by the end of October</a> if cases continue to climb at current levels.</p><p>Not all of these failures should be placed at the Johnson government’s door, although many of them must be. The speed and scale of the pandemic would have been a hugely demanding challenge to any government, even to a more obviously competent and focused one than this. Nor is it fair to pretend that Britain’s failure to contain the second wave is unique. Other and better governments in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/oct/08/coronavirus-live-news-brazil-cases-pass-5m-trump-calls-catching-covid-a-blessing-in-disguise" title="">western Europe</a>, as well as the UK devolved administrations, are struggling too. France, Spain and Ireland, among others, are facing comparable surges. Even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/08/germany-fears-spiralling-covid-spread-as-cases-rise-suddenly" title="">Germany</a> has warned that infections are spiralling out of control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-second-wave-deepening-the-divide">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Poet Fiona Sampson explains why she admires the 2020 Nobel laureate and picks her favourite poems from a long career</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/08/louise-gluck-wins-the-2020-nobel-prize-in-literature">Louise Glück wins the 2020 Nobel prize in literature</a></li></ul><p>I have been reading Louise Glück for more than 20 years, longer than the many poets whose star has risen and waned in the meantime; longer than I’ve been writing poetry. Perhaps this is why I’m so moved and excited by today’s announcement that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/08/louise-gluck-wins-the-2020-nobel-prize-in-literature">77-year old American has won the Nobel prize in literature</a>.</p><p>But I think it’s much more than this. The 12 collections (and two chapbooks) of poetry that Glück has published to date vary enormously in style and theme, from the domestic and familial stories of her first books, 1968’s aptly-titled Firstborn and her breakthrough second collection <a href="https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9780856460289">The House on Marshland</a> (1975), to the fabular and increasingly philosophic writing of later work like <a href="https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781857548372">Averno</a> (2006) – named for the entrance to the Classical underworld – and her most recent collection, <a href="https://www.carcanet.co.uk/cgi-bin/indexer?product=9781847774798">Faithful and Virtuous Night</a> (2014). But what unites all this work is a quality of lucid, calm attention. You read a passage by Glück and think, Ah yes, of course, <em>this </em>is how it is. She has the extraordinary writer’s gift of making clear what is, outside the world of her poem, complex.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/08/louise-gluck-where-to-start-with-an-extraordinary-nobel-winner">Continue reading...</a>

As the condition takes hold, sufferers may start to feel demotivated, even angry. In England, it may already be endemic in those parts of the north where this year has felt like one long endlessly rolling lockdown – in those places where fresh restrictions were reimposed within weeks of everyone emerging from hibernation this June, and people woke on Thursday to news that the government may now follow Scotland’s lead in shutting pubs and restaurants.</p><p>And no, this mystery illness isn’t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/08/60000-may-have-long-covid-for-more-than-three-months-uk-study">long Covid</a>, the symptoms that linger long after the fever subsides. It’s what the World Health Organization this week called<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/06/europe-must-go-beyond-science-to-survive-covid-crisis-says-who"> “pandemic fatigue”</a>, a Europe-wide phenomenon where people get so tired of living like this that they simply stop following the rules. The battle this winter is no longer just against a virus. It’s against an encroaching sense of hopelessness, exhaustion and resentment setting in as it becomes clear that eradicating the virus isn’t going to work, and “light-touch” local lockdowns are no longer keeping a lid on it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/08/while-sturgeon-takes-decisive-action-on-covid-johnson-just-blusters">Continue reading...</a>

It was rare that we saw art – my parents were writers, and we didn’t spend a lot of time in museums. It was a bag hanging from the ceiling, it must have been made out of resin, filled with what turned out to be honey. Picture a cow’s udder as big as your arms can stretch. And very slowly, it thinned at the bottom with the weight of the honey and then broke and the honey slowly came pouring out. It’s not abstract because it’s an actual bag of honey – but it was certainly abstract in that a lot of what I was feeling I couldn’t put into words, though it was strong and specific nonetheless. It was a kind of longing. It’s luxurious and you wanna be part of it or touch it; it reminds of you of something that makes you wanna cry. That you could communicate that way rather than intellectually, like my parents were so good at doing, was very radical to me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/oct/08/miranda-july-teenage-obsessions-bikini-kill-kajillionaire-director">Continue reading...</a>

The cascade of awfulness never seems to end. Amid all this chaos, the responsibilities of adulthood – work, chores, bills – feel insurmountable, and the world around us feels unrecognizable. One of the only things getting me through it is cinema, and the movie I keep returning to for its insightful portrait of this pervasive malaise and our simmering resentment in response to it is Macon Blair’s directorial debut, I Don’t Feel at Home in This World Anymore.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/06/selah-and-the-spades-my-streaming-gem">My streaming gem: why you should watch Selah and the Spades</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/08/i-dont-feel-at-home-in-this-world-anymore-streaming-gem">Continue reading...</a>

## Saint Maud review – nursing a nightmare of erotic intimacy | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week

<p>Morfydd Clark is superb as a troubled caregiver in this extraordinarily scary horror melodrama </p><p>Last year, Morfydd Clark appeared in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/02/the-personal-history-of-david-copperfield-review-armano-iannucci">Armando Iannucci’s new version of David Copperfield</a> playing both David’s mother and the woman he’s in love with – a Freudian-doppelganger performance so coolly understated that many didn’t realise it was happening, or quite why they found Clark’s appearance(s) so disquieting. Well, there’s nothing understated about her now, and what a sensational breakthrough in this extraordinary horror melodrama from first-time feature director Rose Glass. Clark gives an operatically freaky turn that knifed me in the kidneys, the way Catherine Deneuve did in Repulsion or Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves. And her final split second on screen is the equivalent of brutally pulling out the knife to start the internal bleeding.</p><p>It’s a scary movie that is also a satirical nightmare about the physical and erotic intimacy of nursing. The setting is the seaside town of Scarborough, along whose seafront and garish arcade frontages Maud is in the habit of going for moody solo walks. She is an intense and lonely young woman living in a scuzzy bedsit, employed as a private agency nurse and palliative caregiver. She prays often, asking to be delivered from incessant stomach pains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/08/saint-maud-review-rose-glass-morfydd-clark-jennifer-shle">Continue reading...</a>

## The virtual Tory conference was a gift to Johnson – he managed to avoid his party | Katy Balls

<p>With plummeting approval ratings and MPs in revolt, a virtual event offered the prime minister some much-needed cover</p><p>An empty hall, with no overly enthusiastic ministers in sight or bespectacled Tory activists on hand to cheer: this year’s Conservative conference was billed as Boris Johnson’s worst nightmare. A politician who has spent his career trading on his ability to rally a crowd had to give a leader’s speech <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/06/johnson-does-the-tory-conference-shuffle-but-misses-his-audience">with no audience</a>, attempting to offer optimism looking down the camera lens. At moments like this, of all prime ministers who could have had their premiership dominated by social distancing, Johnson seems the least suited.</p><p>Yet as this year’s Tory conference draws to a close, several of Johnson’s colleagues are in truth relieved the event ended up being a virtual one. Although the website crashed, MPs complained about Zoom call capacity, and the virtual stalls failed to make a splash, the online format did allow the prime minister one conference win: Johnson managed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEspZoTnHoo">avoid his own party</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/08/virtual-tory-conference-boris-johnson-mps">Continue reading...</a>

Here are 10 of the oddest offerings shared by readers</p><p>This year, as we spent months locked down at home and eating out became less routine, our habits changed in weird and wonderful ways.

<p>The challenges of re-engineering the global economy by 2050 were already immense, even before the advent of Covid-19</p><p>In terms of energy, we are living in an “after-Paris” world. For, in the half-decade since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/13/paris-climate-deal-cop-diplomacy-developing-united-nations">Paris climate agreement</a>, its impact has only continued to grow. The idea of an energy transition to what is called “net zero carbon” by 2050, which is at the heart of the agreement, is becoming embedded in the strategies of investors and companies and in the policies of governments. There are widespread calls for large green stimuli while interest rates are low. If elected, Joe Biden’s wide-ranging <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/14/joe-biden-climate-jobs-plan">climate plan</a> would put the US on the same path as Britain and European governments.</p><p>Yet no one at that Paris conference in 2015 could have imagined that a pandemic would sweep the world in 2020 and impose an economic dark age on people across the globe. What does that mean for mapping the path towards the energy transition?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/commentisfree/2020/oct/08/pandemic-affect-fossil-fuels">Continue reading...</a>

## Behind China’s ‘pork miracle’: how technology is transforming rural hog farming

<p>As Chinese demand for pork grows and grows, traditional small-scale farms are being replaced by vast, AI-assisted operations that feel more like smartphone factories than bucolic countryside havens</p><p>In November 2018, I travelled to Guangzhou, a city of about 14 million people in southern China. Late autumn is the time for making <em>lap yuk</em>, a type of preserved pork that is a local speciality, and across town I would often spot slabs of meat hanging from high-rise apartment balconies, tied up with string and swaying next to shirts and sheets left out to dry. To make lap yuk, a piece of raw pork belly is soaked in a blend of rice wine, salt, soy sauce and spices, then hung out to cure in the damp, cold autumn air. The fat becomes translucent and imparts a savoury-sweet taste to any stir-fried vegetable dish. A relative of mine claims that only southern China can make preserved pork like this. The secret is the native spores and bacteria that are carried on the wind there.</p><p>Guangzhou was the first stop on a journey I was taking in order to try to understand how artificial intelligence is transforming China’s pork industry. The country is the world’s largest producer of pork, and the story of how it has ramped up production in recent years to feed its growing middle class is sometimes described as “China’s pork miracle”. While overall meat consumption still trails behind countries such as the US, China’s annual pork consumption of 54m tonnes – the highest total worldwide, though some countries still consume more per capita – is only expected to grow in the coming years. Now, in a bid to satisfy this growing demand, farmers are turning to AI.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/08/behind-chinas-pork-miracle-how-technology-is-transforming-rural-hog-farming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Losing my mother during a pandemic has been surreal and confusing; it’s hard to figure out what moving forward looks like</p><p>During the early days of Covid-19, I never considered that the virus could take my favorite person from me, but my mother was in a high-risk situation. She had been living in a geriatric center trying to recover from a heart attack that caused severe brain damage. Even before Covid, I had prayed that if she wasn’t going to come back to us as the hilarious, free-spirited protector we knew, perhaps she should be put out of her suffering. Still, I was blindsided in July when there was a phone call, a shriek, a crack in the sky.</p><p>Losing my mother during a pandemic has been a surreal and confusing experience.
