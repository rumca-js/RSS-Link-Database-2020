Here's the description from my session:\n\n\"Make sure you never commit a broken playbook using Molecule, Ansible, and GitHub Actions. Jeff Geerling discusses his CI workflows using GitHub Actions to manage hundreds of Ansible-based projects, including playbooks, roles, collections, and even Kubernetes Operators. Learn how Molecule makes developing and testing Ansible content easier, and how you can integrate it with GitHub Actions\u2014or any other CI environment\u2014for easy Ansible CI.\"\n\n#AnsibleFest #Ansible #Molecule", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93urFkaJQ44", "date_published": "2020-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
