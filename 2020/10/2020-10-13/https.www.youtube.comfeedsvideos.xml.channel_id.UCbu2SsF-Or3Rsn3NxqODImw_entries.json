Now, with Valhalla, it seems to have found a sweet spot somewhere in the middle. As Eivor is an outsider--an invader, no less--stealth plays a crucial role in Valhalla, as most people will attack them on sight.\u00a0\n\nJordan also explains how constantly upgrading Eivor's settlement plays a huge role in Valhalla, making its gameplay loop feel more cyclical, and more akin to RPGs like Mass Effect's, or Dragon Age Inquisition's. But those who loved Assassin's Creed Odyssey's long, winding side missions may be disappointed, as Valhalla offers much quicker, bite-sized side missions.\n\nFor Jordan's full impressions, be sure to watch the video. Assassin's Creed Valhalla launches on November 10 on Xbox Series X and S, PlayStation 4, Stadia, and PC, before coming to PlayStation 5 on November 12.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qV244soVqRM", "date_published": "2020-10-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Mix Next Livestream", "description": "The MIX Next live event will feature new game reveals, videos, special guests, and more during the main show.

The series spans from Ancient Greece to the Viking Age to modern day, with players wielding tomahawks in Rome and slicing heads with hidden blades in Ancient Egypt. However, the age-old battle over magical, advanced technology is secretive and altogether more complex.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed tells an alternative history of the creation and development of human civilization, and it all ties back to an ancient, super-advanced species that ruled over Earth long before the Assassins and Templars even existed. Many Assassin\u2019s Creed games not only reference an alternate history, but also religions and figures from ancient civilizations like Greece, Egypt, and Italy. It seems possible the next installment in the series, Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla, could not only involve the Isu and Norse mythology, but also Norse pieces of eden, or a humanity-threatening event like Ragnarok. \n\nThe ways in which Assassin\u2019s Creed games weave together an alternative historical timeline with the ancient species that created humanity makes the series even more interesting to play and immerse yourself in. So in preparation for Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla next month, let\u2019s dive in and see where this massive series and the origin of humanity, all began.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQl37KNNfIY", "date_published": "2020-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Every Xbox Start Up Sound (2001 - 2020)", "description": "Here's every boot up sound for the Xbox from the 2001's original Xbox, all the way through to the upcoming Series X|S.\n\nWe're on the brink of a new console generation, as Microsoft is ushering in the Xbox Series X and S consoles in November.

A Daily Bugle article talks about the city watching Miles train along the rooftops with Peter Parker. This tells us that Miles will have familiarity with his abilities before the game starts and Peter Parker could have a significant role in the game as Miles' mentor. We also got our first look at Miles' trademark hoodie costume, the same outfit he wore in Into the Spiderverse.\n\nLastly, Persia talks about a Dreamcast mini that could possibly be in the works. In a Famitsu interview translated by Siliconera, Sega creative producer Yosuke Okunari talked about the company's mini consoles and said, \"For the next Mini, we are considering everything that has been imagined by everyone. If I have to say some names, it could be an SG-1000 Mini or a Dreamcast Mini.\" The original Dreamcast was home to Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio, and many more.\n\nThis is your Save State for Monday, October 12th.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxod-yEvD4g", "date_published": "2020-10-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
