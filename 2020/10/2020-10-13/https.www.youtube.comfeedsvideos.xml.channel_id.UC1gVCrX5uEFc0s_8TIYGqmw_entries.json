In 1896, they created the famous Icarian games, acrobatics performed no longer with objects but with human beings. The Kremos were in Paris at the Marigny theater from May 30, 1899 and were very successful there. Even today, juggler Kris Kremo carries on the family tradition in the circus world.\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
