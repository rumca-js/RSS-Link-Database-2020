the national flu immunisation programme will be absolutely essential to protecting vulnerable people

and supporting the resilience of the health and care system 

Mild to severe illness

Higher viral doses, the more sick people became

Annually (US) since 2010

9 million – 45 million illnesses

140,000 – 810,000 hospitalizations

12,000 – 61,000 deaths

Clinical features in children

Fever, which may be as high as 103°F (39.4°C) to 105°F (40.5°C)

Body aches, which may be severe

Headache

Sore throat

Cough that gets worse

Tiredness

Runny or stuffy nose

Nausea

Vomiting

Diarrhea

Possible complications in children

Pneumonia

Dehydration

Salts (electrolytes)

Worsening of long-term medical problems

Brain dysfunction such as encephalopathy

Sinus problems and ear infections

In rare cases, death

Initial concern

Increased Risk of Noninfluenza Respiratory Virus Infections Associated With Receipt of Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (Clinical Infectious Diseases, 2012)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3404712/

We were able to observe a statistically significant increased risk of confirmed noninfluenza respiratory virus infection among TIV recipients

Covid-19: Risk of death more than doubled in people who also had flu, English data show

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3720

Odds of death were 2.27 times higher than in people with SARS-CoV-2 alone

possible synergistic effects in coinfected people


Safety of Influenza Vaccine during COVID-19 (September 2020, Journal of Clinical and Translational Science, Cleveland Clinic)

https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/safety-of-influenza-vaccine-during-covid19/C26A417046677E65D421AD33B3E6281F

The convergence with influenza season could result in significant morbidity and mortality

Patients (n = 18,868) tested for COVID-19

4,138 flu vac, 2019-2020

9,082 not flu vaccinated

Vaccinated group

Higher BMI

On more meds

More co-morbidities 

Older

Blood work

Is someone had flu vac and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2

Unadjusted analysis shows:

Vaccinated individuals were less likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2

More likely to be hospitalized

More likely to be admitted to the ICU and die during hospitalization

But, once adjusted

Influenza vaccination was unrelated to incidence of SARS- CoV-2 infection

Increased risk for worse hospital outcomes was not related to influenza vaccination

In people with COVID-19, influenza vaccination did not impact risk for hospitalization

Or ICU admission 

Or hospital mortality 

Overall

Influenza vaccination does not increase the incidence of COVID-19

or worsen the related morbidity or mortality

Providing reassurance that the vaccination strategy for global influenza should proceed as planned during the COVID-19 pandemic 

Surveillance data needs to be prospectively collected in fall 2020

Study the outcome of concurrent SARS-CoV-2 and influenza infection

Assess any interaction between influenza vaccinations, a newly developed vaccine against coronavirus, influenza and COVID-19 infection

Odds of death were 2.27 times higher than in people with SARS-CoV-2 alone

400 deaths a day by the start of November

The people who died today were infected two to three weeks ago

people who will die in two to three weeks’ time are among those infected today

doubling time of infections has been about 10 days for the past month

David J Hunter, Oxford University

a steady, inexorable rise in hospitalisations

ICU Covid bed occupancy

and deaths over the last month and leave no doubt the second wave is well advanced

Dr David Strain, University of Exeter

Infections were, first in younger adults, moving into older adults three weeks or so ago

this week is when we would have anticipated the rise in death rates to start occurring

The idea that you can mix freely with five other households is nonsense, basically

Survival of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions
Stability of SARS-CoV-2 in different environmental conditions (Lancet April)

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5247(20)30003-3/fulltext

SARS-CoV-2 more stable on smooth surfaces

No infectious virus could be detected from smooth surfaces on day 4 (glass and banknote)

Overall, SARS-CoV-2 can be highly stable in a favourable environment

Susceptible to standard disinfection methods. 


The effect of temperature on persistence of SARS-CoV-2 on common surfaces (Virology Journal, 7th October)

Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness, Geelong, VIC, Australia

https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12985-020-01418-7

The rate at which COVID-19 has spread throughout the globe has been alarming

Role of fomite transmission is not yet fully understood

The risks of fomite transmission from contaminated surfaces.

This study measured the survival rates of infectious SARS-

CoV-2, on several common surface types

In the dark, (negate any effects of UV light)

20’C

Half-lives 1.7 to 2.7 days

Viral loads equivalent to the highest titres excreted by infectious patients

Viable virus was isolated for up to 28 days at 20 °C from common surfaces 

Glass

Stainless steel

Paper and polymer banknotes

40’C

Virus survived less than 24 h at 40 °C on some surfaces

SARS-CoV-2 can remain infectious for significantly longer time periods than generally considered possible

These results could be used to inform improved risk mitigation procedures to prevent the fomite spread of COVID-19.

Exaggerated risk of transmission of COVID-19 by fomites (Lancet 3rd July)

https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/laninf/PIIS1473-3099(20)30561-2.pdf

In my opinion, the chance of transmission through inanimate surfaces is very small

Where an infected person coughs or sneezes on the surface
and someone else touches that surface soon after the cough or sneeze (within 1–2 h)

I do not disagree with erring on the side of caution

Although periodically disinfecting surfaces and use of gloves are reasonable precautions especially in hospitals

Dynamic Change of COVID-19 Seroprevalence among Asymptomatic Population in Tokyo during the Second Wave (Tokyo and Boston)

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.21.20198796v1.full.pdf

Population 127 million

Cases, 89,650

Deaths, 1,631

Fatality rates, low compared to Western Countries

Decreased despite the absence of lockdown 

? low infection prevalence

? low IFR

Seroprevalence among asymptomatic employees, Tokyo

May 26 to August 25

Healthy volunteer workers, n = 1,877 

IgM and IgG antibodies, test repeated at a month

Symptomatics excluded

Seroconversion

Seroreversion

Results

615 healthy volunteers received at least one test
 
Seroprevalence increased from 5.8 % to 46.8 % over summer

Paralleling the rise in daily confirmed cases within Tokyo

Exclusion of individuals with clinical symptoms, probable underestimation

Peaked on August 4

Peaked with the peak of the second wave

Out of the 350 individuals who completed both offered tests

21.4 % who tested seronegative became seropositive

Seroreversion was found in 12.2 % of initially seropositive participants

81.1% of IgM positive cases at first testing became IgM negative in approximately one month 

IgM+/IgG- was the least common, 0.4% (3/700 total tests)

Short time frame between developing IgM then developing IgG

None of the seroconverted individuals were hospitalized or died

Conclusions

COVID-19 infection may have spread widely across the general population of Tokyo

Despite the very low fatality rate

Temporal correlation between the rise in seropositivity and the decrease in reported COVID-19 cases
