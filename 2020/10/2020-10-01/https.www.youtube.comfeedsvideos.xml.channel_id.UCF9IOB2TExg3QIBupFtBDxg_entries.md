We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately. We will get through this TOGETHER!

COVID-19 Contact tracing, time

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/php/principles-contact-tracing.html
Recall everyone, infectious time frame
Contact tracing, warning exposed individuals (contacts)
Protect patient privacy, contacts are only informed that they may have been exposed
Contacts are provided with education, information, and support
Contacts are encouraged to stay home, 6 feet, 14 days
Monitor themselves by checking temperature twice daily
Watching for cough or shortness of breath
Contacts who develop symptoms should promptly isolate themselves and notify public health staff
Promptly evaluated for infection and for the need for medical care


ASSESSING THE AGE SPECIFICITY OF INFECTION FATALITY RATES FOR COVID-19: SYSTEMATIC REVIEW, META-ANALYSIS, AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPLICATIONS (24th September)
https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v5
Objective
Determine age-specific infection fatality rates
Methods
111 studies
33 locations
Results
Estimated age-specific IFRs
Very low for children and younger adults
Increase progressively
0.4% at age 55
1.3% at age 65
4.2% at age 75
14% at age 85
25% over 90
Discussion: 
Public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths. 
Seasonal flu
Influenza season of winter 2018–19 the U.S. 
~63 million infections
 34 thousand fatalities
Population IFR of 0·05%

Correcting Britain's Vitamin D deficiency could save thousands of lives (David Davis MP, Matt Ridley)

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/09/26/correcting-britains-vitamin-d-deficiency-could-save-thousands/

There is one chemical that:

is known to be safe

known to be needed by many people anyway

known to have a clinically proven track record of helping people fight off 
respiratory diseases

is so cheap no big firm is pushing it

vitamin D

Vitamin D Levels Appear to Play Role in COVID-19 Mortality Rates

https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/news/articles/2020/05/vitamin-d-levels-appear-to-play-role-in-covid-19-mortality-rates.html

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.08.20058578v4

China, France, Germany, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, United States.

Patients with severe deficiency are twice as likely to experience major complications

Spanish clinical trial

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7456194/

Calcifediol group, 2% required admission to the ICU

Control group 50% admitted to ICU

Put another way, the use of Vitamin D reduced a patient’s risk of needing intensive care 25-fold

The Government should now act on this latest evidence

We have good reason to think vitamin D supplementation will help reduce mortality from Covid-19

we know it can reduce the incidence and severity of the other acute respiratory illnesses

pressures from influenza during the winter months

This will no doubt save thousands of lives in any second wave

There is now no reason not to act

Covid-19: Do many people have pre-existing immunity? (21 September 2020, Eshani M King, BMJ)

https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3563/rr-6

Many have T cells that act against SARS-CoV-2 epitopes

Killing intracellular parasites

Critical in viral immunity

T cell response might be more important that B cell response

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pai.13263

B‐cell response might be important, but is not strictly required to overcome the disease

Vaccines focused on antibody levels

Mild or asymptomatic cases, many T-cells are produced

In these mild cases, few or no detectable antibodies

Men produced fewer T-cells than women

Older men produce less T cells than younger men

Vitamin D controls T cell antigen receptor signaling and activation of human T cells, (University of Copenhagen)

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20208539/

Vitamin D essential to facilitate maturation of naïve T cells to dedicated, specific T cells

When a T cell is exposed to a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor, with which it searches for vitamin D

If there is an inadequate vitamin D level,

they won't even begin to mobilize

To convert ng/ml of 25(OH)D to nmol/l the conversion factor is 2.5.

20ng/ml enough to prevent rickets, osteoporosis and osteomalacia

40-60ng/ml or more is required to achieve optimum immune system and cancer fighting capability

30 ng/ml being sufficient but not optimal
