Outside, the bus had pulled up in front of the park, <a href="https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1311604259671150600?s=20">engine running</a>.

Todd played Daniel Robitaille, AKA the Candyman, the hook-handed, bee-spouting yet swoonsome spectre from the 1992 horror classic. “I have never waded in that water. I don’t even listen to people when they come to me and say that. I cut them off. They try it; they want to me stop them or something.”</p><p>Todd is probably getting quite a bit of this right now. Candyman was already enjoying a critical revival in the last few years as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement">Black Lives Matter</a> and other social movements gathered headway; despite, or perhaps because of, its white director (the Englishman Bernard Rose), it was able to smuggle in a theme that was exceptional for a 90s horror film: the psychic cost of centuries of oppression of African Americans.

## Hades review: a sexy, scintillating sojourn in the Greek underworld

<p><strong>PC, Mac, Nintendo Switch; Supergiant Games<br /></strong>This gripping action game set in a hellish realm filled with gorgeous gods and monsters is well worth the years it took to make</p><p>Powered by chugging guitars, frenetic fighting and luscious, flamboyant depictions of figures from Greek mythology, this excellent action game from the arthouse studio Supergiant has been many years in the making. We play as Zagreus, wayward son of the underworld, trying to escape his father’s gloomy domain and see the world above. As an immortal, he cannot die – but each time he is defeated by the denizens of the underworld, whether by the fallen warriors of Elysium or the flaming skulls and witches in Tartarus, he is returned to his bedroom like a shamed teenager, ready to start again.</p><p>In most games of this nature, where each attempt strips you of progress and hard-won powers, being sent back to the start makes me want to quit. But when Zagreus re-emerges into the chambers of Hades, there are gossiping shades and surly servants; the lord of the underworld grumbles over stacks of paperwork, barely glancing upwards to reprimand his son for his latest escape attempt. I am quickly distracted from my failure by some words of sympathy from Nyx, or Megaera mooching in the corner. And before long I am back at it, trying to escape from fiery Asphodel, running into a zombie Charon mumbling over some treasures for sale or descending into a pit to meet Chaos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/oct/01/hades-review-a-sexy-scintillating-sojourn-in-the-greek-underworld">Continue reading...</a>

## It goes way beyond the BBC: the right's target is liberalism itself  | Charlotte Higgins

<p>The corporation’s underpinnings – equality, verifiable facts, the rule of law – are under threat as never before</p><p>It would be tempting, at this moment of fevered speculation about the next chairman, to cry, “Hands off the BBC!” It is true that Charles Moore – the rightwing commentator and former Telegraph editor rumoured to be Downing Street’s favoured candidate – would be an egregious choice. Leaving aside that recruitment for the post is supposedly an open and fair process, rather than organised through an anonymous <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/arch-critics-of-bbc-dacre-and-moore-tipped-for-top-jobs-in-tv-lzn0lvxbs">newspaper briefing</a> emanating from the general direction of Dominic Cummings, no known previous candidate has so <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/sep/28/charles-moore-2014-bbc-executives-utter-bores">openly voiced hostility</a> to the licence fee – the very underpinning, financially and ideologically, of the corporation.</p><p>Nevertheless, “Hands off the BBC!” is an empty injunction, since no government has ever taken their hands off the BBC, nor is there any prospect of their so doing. The level of the licence fee and the broadcaster’s charter are set by the government. Officially, the chair’s appointment is both a process based on open, fair competition, and the result of a final choice made by ministers. The BBC is, then, embroiled with the government in fundamental ways, and always has been. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/01/bbc-right-liberalism-corporation-equality-facts-law">Continue reading...</a>

## How one man spent 34 years in prison after setting fire to a pair of curtains

<p>David Blagdon’s long-term detention has been described as ‘barbaric’. Whatever his disastrous personal choices, the system failed him repeatedly</p><p>There’s never a good time to get a phone call from an escaped prisoner. I was at a talent show in Essex in August 2001, watching a succession of soul singers, when three missed calls from an unknown number appeared on my mobile, starting at 10.07pm. Stepping out of the club, I listened to the first message: “It’s David. I’m at King’s Cross station. This is urgent.”</p><p>David Blagdon was a longtime prisoner who had become a friend after I interviewed him for a story in 1999. He’d left the number of a phone box for me to call him back, and when we spoke, he said he was on temporary home leave from prison and needed somewhere to stay. I called my neighbours in London, who agreed to let him in. It was after midnight when I returned to find David chatting to my neighbours, eating a sausage and drinking a beer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/oct/01/one-man-34-years-prison-setting-fire-curtains-david-blagdon">Continue reading...</a>

But not everyone is happy</p><p>In <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2002/jul/03/theatre.artsfeatures1">The Good Companions</a>, the 1929 novel that gave him national fame, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/aug/16/jb-priestley-grand-old-grumbler-dies-1984">JB Priestley</a> begins high up on the Pennines – the “knobbly backbone of England”. Looking down on the huddled communities that make their living in a Yorkshire landscape both beautiful and bleak, the author tells us: “At first the towns only seem a blacker edge to the high moorland, but now that you are closer you see the host of tall chimneys, the rows and rows of little houses, built of blackening stone, that are like tiny sharp ridges on the hills. These windy moors, these clanging dark valleys, these factories and little stone houses, have between them bred a race that has special characteristics.”</p><p>From the literature of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/17/anne-bronte-sister-men-charlotte-emily">the Bront</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/jan/17/anne-bronte-sister-men-charlotte-emily">ë sisters</a> and Priestley to films such as Lindsay Anderson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jun/05/this-sporting-life-review">This Sporting Life</a> and Ken Loach’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/20/kes-drawing-the-curtains-on-barnsley-ken-loach-1969">Kes</a>, Yorkshire’s pastoral beauty, industrial grit and pugnacious spirit has proved fertile terrain for artists in search of contrast and drama.
