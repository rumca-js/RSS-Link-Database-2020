This Friday, Oct. 2, Dawes will release "Good Luck With Whatever," their seventh studio album. In honor of that, we're looking back at the long relationship The Current has enjoyed with Dawes and sharing these performances the band recorded with us in 2011 and 2017, plus another recorded almost exactly one year ago with the Live From Here gang. One of these was recorded in the Forum at Minnesota Public Radio, the next at Icehouse in Minneapolis as part of The Current's MicroShow series, and the third was recorded at the Town Hall in New York City on Sept. 28, 2019.
