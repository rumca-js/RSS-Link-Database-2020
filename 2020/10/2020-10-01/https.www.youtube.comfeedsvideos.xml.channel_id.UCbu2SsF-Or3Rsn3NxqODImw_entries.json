Xbox Series X-related topics covered include the load times, and whether the improvement is significant enough to warrant an upgrade to the new Xbox. On top of that, we talk about how the Quick Resume feature works and whether it takes up any SSD space, whether cross-gen parties are possible, and if the Series X supports ultra-wide resolutions.\n\nWe also get to the bottom of how much freedom there is to dictate resolution and framerate performance, how the Series X controller stacks up in terms of input latency, and, of course, if it can run Crysis. \n\nGeneration Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X.

Activision says this version is something of a reboot, with a fresh start to the story and tweaks to the progression system.\n\nWith Cyberpunk 2077 releasing on November 19, CD Projekt Red has entered a mandatory crunch period with six-day work weeks, despite previous indications this would not happen. Studio head Adam Badowski has released a statement trying to justify the final-month crunch. \n\nSpider-Man: Miles Morales game saves will transfer from PS4 to PS5, but save date from the original Spider-Man will not. This is because Spider-Man: Remastered is only coming to PS5 as an add-on for Miles Morales as part of the Ultimate Edition.

One being a reveal of gameplay, and the other an introductory cutscene to the brand new story within the mode. There\u2019s a lot of new features coming to Zombies mode, so let\u2019s break down what we know so far beginning with the story. Set in the 1980s Cold War timeline, we see Samantha Maxis calling Black Ops 1\u2019s Grigori Weaver with information about a zombie outbreak from the second world war. She sends him a videotape with footage of the underground lab housing the Die Maschine once used to experiment on test subjects. Weaver can\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing and forms a team to go down and investigate the lab before any other rivaling countries can uncover it. \n\nThe short Treyarch presentation brought us tons of new information on what\u2019s to come. We\u2019ll be seeing the return of some classic perk-a-cola machines including quick revive and juggernog as well some new ones like Elemental Pop. Also returning are the Pack-A-Punch Machine (which can be used to greatly enhance your weapon of choice) Ray Gun and other Wonder Weapons, as well as the elusive mystery box. New types of hellhounds and zombies were also revealed. They appear to be mutated from radiation poisoning- one in particular is in a radiation suit and looks to have his own abilities.\n\nThe game mode itself is getting a bit of a facelift with additions such as support slots. Alongside your tactical equipment, the support slot will give you the ability to use a scorestreak-based move on the zombie hoard. (The trailer shows off a chopper gunner being used) You\u2019ll also be able to use any gun you want from the start so say bye bye to the old pistol. Other changes announced were the ability to carry over your weapon\u2019s progression across Cold War\u2019s modes- a big first for zombies mode.
