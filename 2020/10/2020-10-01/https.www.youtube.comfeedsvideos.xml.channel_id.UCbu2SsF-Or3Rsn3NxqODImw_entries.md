Another PS5 launch title has been confirmed. The Pathless, published by Annapurna Interactive, will launch for Sony's brand new console on November 12. It will run at 60 FPS and take advantage of the new DualSense controller.

The next fighter to come to Smash Bros. Ultimate will be Steve from Minecraft. Steve can palette swap with Alex, an Enderman, and a zombie. They fight with a pickaxe, TNT, and a sword.

Cross-play is coming to Apex Legends on October 6. The new update will allow cross-platform play between Xbox One, PS4, Origin, and Steam at a later time. The Aftermarket Collection Event will also add a new limited-time mode, Flashpoint.

This week on Generation Next, we answer your burning questions about the Xbox Series X, after our hands on with the brand new console.

There might not be much in the way of new revelations about the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5 this week, but that just means we've got the perfect opportunity to bring in our tech expert Michael Higham, who has a working Xbox Series X, and ask him about his experiences with it.

On the last episode of Generation Next we asked you to submit your questions for Michael and, in this Xbox Series X special, we put them to him. Xbox Series X-related topics covered include the load times, and whether the improvement is significant enough to warrant an upgrade to the new Xbox. On top of that, we talk about how the Quick Resume feature works and whether it takes up any SSD space, whether cross-gen parties are possible, and if the Series X supports ultra-wide resolutions.

We also get to the bottom of how much freedom there is to dictate resolution and framerate performance, how the Series X controller stacks up in terms of input latency, and, of course, if it can run Crysis. 

Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.

Zombies mode is coming to Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, Cyberpunk 2077's devs asked to crunch, and Spider-Man: Miles Morales saves can transfer from PS4 to PS5.

In your Save State for September 30, Chastity gives you details on Zombies mode in Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. Activision says this version is something of a reboot, with a fresh start to the story and tweaks to the progression system.

With Cyberpunk 2077 releasing on November 19, CD Projekt Red has entered a mandatory crunch period with six-day work weeks, despite previous indications this would not happen. Studio head Adam Badowski has released a statement trying to justify the final-month crunch. 

Spider-Man: Miles Morales game saves will transfer from PS4 to PS5, but save date from the original Spider-Man will not. This is because Spider-Man: Remastered is only coming to PS5 as an add-on for Miles Morales as part of the Ultimate Edition. If you play the remaster, you'll notice that Peter Parker looks different and that's because Insomniac has a new face model for the character, replacing John Bubniak with Ben Jordan.

Let's go over Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's Zombie mode reveal and recap the new story, equipment, and familiar locations of this new installment.

After a long easter egg hunt, Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War revealed their Zombies mode and released two trailers. One being a reveal of gameplay, and the other an introductory cutscene to the brand new story within the mode. There’s a lot of new features coming to Zombies mode, so let’s break down what we know so far beginning with the story. Set in the 1980s Cold War timeline, we see Samantha Maxis calling Black Ops 1’s Grigori Weaver with information about a zombie outbreak from the second world war. She sends him a videotape with footage of the underground lab housing the Die Maschine once used to experiment on test subjects. Weaver can’t believe what he’s seeing and forms a team to go down and investigate the lab before any other rivaling countries can uncover it. 

The short Treyarch presentation brought us tons of new information on what’s to come. We’ll be seeing the return of some classic perk-a-cola machines including quick revive and juggernog as well some new ones like Elemental Pop. Also returning are the Pack-A-Punch Machine (which can be used to greatly enhance your weapon of choice) Ray Gun and other Wonder Weapons, as well as the elusive mystery box. New types of hellhounds and zombies were also revealed. They appear to be mutated from radiation poisoning- one in particular is in a radiation suit and looks to have his own abilities.

The game mode itself is getting a bit of a facelift with additions such as support slots. Alongside your tactical equipment, the support slot will give you the ability to use a scorestreak-based move on the zombie hoard. (The trailer shows off a chopper gunner being used) You’ll also be able to use any gun you want from the start so say bye bye to the old pistol. Other changes announced were the ability to carry over your weapon’s progression across Cold War’s modes- a big first for zombies mode. Keep it tuned to GameSpot as Cold War’s release date approaches for continued coverage of zombies, Multiplayer and Warzone.

Following a brief tease, Nintendo has announced the next fighter for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. It's Steve from Minecraft, the blocky pickaxe-wielding hero!

The presentation showed a few alternate skins: Alex, Enderman, and Zombie. We also got a brief glimpse at a Minecraft-themed stage, which appears to be able to swap between different biomes. The trailer showed a forest as it appears lush and green, wilted in the fall, and snowy in the winter.
