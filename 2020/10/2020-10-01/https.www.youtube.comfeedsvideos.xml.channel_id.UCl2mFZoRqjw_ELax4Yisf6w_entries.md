I bought a unit pack power battery. I used it to less than 40% its continuous rated power output. It exploded. The company communicated with me in a manner afterwards that, in my opinion, demonstrates they do not understand basic electronics, much less battery manufacturing. I would not buy another unitpackpower battery.
