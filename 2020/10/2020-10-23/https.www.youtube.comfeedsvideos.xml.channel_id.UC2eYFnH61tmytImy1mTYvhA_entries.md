I have a new SSD for my computer, so in this video, I want to move my operating system over to it and make it bootable. This will free up space on my older 1TB hard drive, but also give me more space to have more goodies. I'll have to do things like renew the device's copied UUID as well. I also move over my copy of the Monero blockchain to the new hard drive.

I got an MSATA sold state drive to increase the storage space on my ThinkPad. I now have it and a terabyte SSD. Some MSATA drives can actually be as large as a TB, but this one was "only" 256 GB. I plan on moving my operating system over to it and perhaps my backup of the Monero blockchain.

The ThinkPad X220 was the first of the X series ThinkPads to have an MSATA slot. While I like the X200, I don't believe any of them came with it.
