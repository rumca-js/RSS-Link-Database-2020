enough to land them in hospital yet have persisted for many weeks or months\n\nHospitalised patients recognised to have lasting dyspnoea and fatigue in particular \n\nLatest analysis of data\n\nN = 4,182 users of the COVID Symptom Study app\n\nSymptom Study app users, consistently logging their health, and positive by swab PCR

COVID\n\nSymptoms\n\nAge\n\nGender\n\nBMI\n\nComorbidities\n\nAccurately predict level of risk of developing long-term symptoms\n\nEleven days or less\n\nMost people reported being back to normal\n\nSymptoms lasting for at least 4 weeks\n\nOne in seven (13.3%, 558 users) 4 weeks\n\n(14.5%)\n\nStaying ill for 8 weeks\n\nOne in 20 (4.5%, 189 users) staying ill for 8 weeks\n\n(51%)\n\nSuffering for longer than 12 weeks\n\nOne in fifty (2.3%, 95 users)\n\n(2.2%) \n\nWho is most likely to get long COVID?\n\nAge (strongest predictor)\n\nOlder people are much more likely than younger people\n\nDoes occur across all ages\n\nAround 10% of 18 - 49 year olds\n\nAround 22% of over 70s\n\nSymptoms (second predictor)\n\nMore different symptoms in first week (16.3%)\n\nMore than 5 symptoms, OR, 3.95\n\nFatigue OR=2.83\n\nHeadache, OR=2.62\n\nDyspnoea OR=2.36\n\nHoarse voice OR=2.33\n\nMyalgia OR=2.22\n\nSymptoms aged over 70\n\nLoss of smell was the most

slightly more likely to suffer from long COVID\n\nMen 9.5%\n\nWomen 14.5%\n\nComorbidities\n\nAsthma\n\nNo clear links to any other underlying health conditions.\n\nLong COVID symptoms\n\nFell into two broad groups\n\nGroup 1\n\nDominated by respiratory symptoms, cough, shortness of breath\n\nFatigue and headaches\n\nGroup 2\n\nMulti-system\n\nAffecting many parts of the body, brain, gut and heart \n\nPalpitations\n\nFast heartbeat\n\nPins and needles or numbness\n\nProblems concentrating (\u2018brain fog\u2019)\n\nPeople who experienced a wide range of symptoms across many body systems were more likely to need a hospital assessment\n\nPeople with long COVID with recurrence of symptoms\n\n16%\n\nPeople with short COVID with recurrence of symptoms\n\n8.4%\n\nPredicting who will get long COVID\n\nModel able to identify 69% of people who went on to get Long-Covid\n\ni.e. predictive model has 69% sensitivity\n\nModel was 73 % effective in avoiding false alarms\n\ni.e. predicative model was 73% specific\n\nData checked with an independent dataset of 2,475 with positive coronavirus antibody test, similar results\n\nApp will give probability\n\nHelp target early interventions and research\n\nPoorly-understood phenomenon.\n\nThe scale of the problem\n\nDr Claire Steves, King\u2019s College\n\nIt\u2019s important we use the knowledge we have gained from the first wave in the pandemic to reduce the long-term impact of the second\n\nThanks to the diligent logging of our contributors so far, this research could already pave the way for preventative and treatment strategies to reduce the long term effects\n\nUsing the app daily can help affected people and their doctors better categorise and judge their risks of developing longer more severe disease\n\nWe urge everyone to join the effort by downloading and sharing the app and taking just a minute every day to log your health\n  \nTim Spector\n\nCOVID -19 is a mild illness for many\n\nbut for over one in 50 people symptoms can persist for longer than 12 weeks\n\nSo it\u2019s important that, as well as worrying about excess deaths, we also need to consider those who will be affected by long COVID \u2026\n\nif we don\u2019t get the pandemic under control soon\n\nHaving such large numbers of people affected means specialist services need to be set up urgently with the full financial help for hospitals and GPs\n\nAs we wait for a vaccine, it is vital that we all work together to stem the spread of coronavirus \u2026\n\nvia lifestyle changes and more rigorous self isolating with symptoms or positive tests\n\n\nReview of comorbidities in acute COVID\n\nhttps://reference.medscape.com/viewarticle/939436_3\n\nRisk factors for severe COVID-19, regardless of age, include the following: \n\nObesity (body mass index \u2265 30 kg/m2)\n\nChronic kidney disease\n\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n\nImmunocompromised state due to solid organ transplant\n\nSerious heart conditions (e.g.

use in real life settings\n\nProfessor Ian Jones, virology, Reading University\n\nThe poor performance of convalescent plasma in this trial is disappointing but not entirely surprising\n\nPlasma is more likely to work if given very early\n\nResearchers should to continue to conduct trials\nbut to do so in newly diagnosed patients.\n\nWe still do not have enough treatments for the early stage of disease to prevent severe disease and until this becomes an option, avoiding being infected with the virus remains the key message\n\nImplications\nMAB therapy\nLong term immunity\nVaccination\n\nIf
