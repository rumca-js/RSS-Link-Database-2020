It’s a flattering “authorised” portrait, featuring interviews with famous Newton muses Charlotte Rampling, Grace Jones and Claudia Schiffer. But director Gero von Boehm deserves points for not ignoring the “porno chic” controversy surrounding his more extreme fetishistic images of naked women. There’s a brilliant clip of Newton appearing as a guest on French TV alongside Susan Sontag, who accuses him to his face of being a misogynist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/23/helmut-newton-the-bad-and-the-beautiful-review">Continue reading...</a>

Just ask Sean Connery, who picked up James Bond’s Walther PPK again in the sub-par Diamonds Are Forever despite George Lazenby having played the role in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service two years earlier.</p><p>And yet there is something iffy about this week’s <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/jared-leto-to-play-joker-in-zack-snyders-justice-league-exclusive">news</a> that Jared Leto will play the Joker once again in Zack Snyder’s reworked version of Justice League, which is being brought to the small screen by HBO Max after a <a href="https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/6/12/18662603/release-zack-snyder-cut-justice-league-zack">fan campaign</a>.

<p>Seven months into lockdown, it’s impossible to trick the mind into thinking things aren’t rubbish when they patently are</p><p>One of my first jobs was flogging double-glazing appointments on the phone. The manager would walk around, pointing at his deranged forced grin as a reminder to smile when speaking. “Happiness is contagious,” he’d say. “If you smile, they smile, and if they smile, they spend.” So even though my hands trembled as I lifted the receiver, I forced a smile, and kept it even when my cheeks hurt.</p><p>Perhaps that was the moment I became a believer in the “brave face”. My own brave face is modelled on the duck, both in terms of my Instagram pout (because nothing says “I am coping with life!” like going in for a snog with a screen), and in terms of channelling effortlessness: I try to look as if I’m gliding, even if I’m frantically treading water to keep afloat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/23/im-all-for-positive-thinking-but-my-brave-face-is-starting-to-slip-coco-khan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My new camo specs have got me into all sorts of trouble </p><p>I have worn glasses since I was at school. In that era, getting a new pair of specs was a horrendous affair. I would wait for the bus, terrified of the reaction. I’d get on, and see the joy on my friends’ faces as they realised that they wouldn’t be the targets for any banter that day, as I was about to get absolutely destroyed. And then I would sit and listen to them call me everything from the unimaginative “four eyes” to the almost impressive “Romesh Rangogglenathan”.</p><p>As an adult, I have grown used to seeing my face with glasses, so much so that I don’t think I will ever go for the corrective surgery that would render them unnecessary. I like wearing them (face-mask steaming notwithstanding), and am pretty sure it’s glasses all the way. But recently I started to think about buying some more colourful options to mix it up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/23/glasses-wearer-for-life-jazzy-pair-liven-things-up-romesh-ranganathan">Continue reading...</a>

## Why is the UK government suddenly targeting 'critical race theory'? | Daniel Trilling

<p>By importing Trump’s culture war, the Conservatives are trying to close down any discussion of structural inequality</p><p>Until this month, according to the parliamentary record, Hansard, the term “critical race theory” had never once been uttered in the House of Commons chamber. By the end of the day on 20 October, however, it was of such importance that the government declared itself “unequivocally against” the concept. “We do not want to see teachers teaching their pupils about white privilege and inherited racial guilt,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/20/teaching-white-privilege-is-a-fact-breaks-the-law-minister-says">warned the equalities minister</a>, Kemi Badenoch, at the end of a six-hour debate to mark Black History Month. “Any school which teaches these elements of critical race theory, or which promotes partisan political views such as defunding the police without offering a balanced treatment of opposing views, is breaking the law.”</p><p>Strictly speaking, critical race theory is an academic field that originated in the US around 40 years ago. As the <a href="https://twitter.com/KojoKoram/status/1318864376288432128">British academic Kojo Koram</a> notes, it began as an attempt by legal scholars to understand why black communities experienced discrimination in the criminal justice system, even though they were formally guaranteed equal rights. Today, the term has become a kind of shorthand in US politics for an approach to race relations that asks white people to consider their structural advantage within a system that has, historically, been profoundly racist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/23/uk-critical-race-theory-trump-conservatives-structural-inequality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Voters fearing mail backlogs and confused by the process are traveling long distances to avoid casting mail-in ballots</p><p>In mid-October, Sade Onadiji boarded a flight from Chicago to Houston, Texas, to cast her vote for Joe Biden. She had quarantined ahead of time and gotten a Covid test. On the plane, she Clorox-wiped her seat, wore gloves, and doubled up with a N95 mask and a face shield. When she arrived at her mother’s house, she wore a mask inside and stayed upstairs for a few days before getting another test. Then she, her mom, and her brother voted together at the Smart Financial Centre.</p><p>Onadiji was born and raised in Texas and had always voted in the Houston suburbs. But this year, though she was pursuing her MBA at the University of Chicago, she decided it wasn’t the time to experiment with absentee voting. Onadiji was concerned because the state Republicans have a record of voter suppression – she pointed to Governor Gregg Abbott’s executive order that each county was only allowed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/01/texas-governor-greg-abbott-ballot-votes-election">single ballot drop-off location</a>.

<p>As F1 returns to Portugal for the first time in 24 years this weekend, we look back at five epic grands prix from the past</p><p>The Boavista street circuit in Porto hosted the first Portuguese F1 grand prix, posing a tough challenge over tramlines, drains and cobblestones, requiring bravery and finesse. It was a task made all the more tricky by a slippery track but Stirling Moss had its measure in the Vanwall. He and Mike Hawthorn, rivals for the title in this ninth of 11 meetings, tussled for the lead and swiftly opened a gap on the field. Moss was masterful past the pillar boxes and lamp posts and soon held the advantage, while Hawthorn looked to hold second with the brakes on his Ferrari not proving up to the task. A spin on the final lap almost ended his hopes. With the car stalled he leapt out to push-start it, but in doing so rejoined against the direction of the circuit and was disqualified. Moss, who had witnessed the incident, went to the officials making the case that Hawthorn had driven on the pavement not the track when he was going the wrong way. They accepted his argument and Hawthorn was allowed to keep his second place. At the end of the season Hawthorn beat Moss to the title by a single point. Moss never won the championship but his credentials as a gentleman and ambassador for fair play have never been in doubt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/23/great-portuguese-gps-from-portos-pavements-to-sennas-crowning-f1-win">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Everyone needs a pick-up now. This classic ritual is a glorious treat’</p><p>In the foyer of the Brighton Grand Hotel, I spied details of their <a href="https://www.grandbrighton.co.uk/dining-and-lounge/afternoon-tea">afternoon tea</a>, served in their rather pretty Victorian terrace lounge overlooking the prom. Twenty types of loose-leaf teas, they promised, and scones, freshly baked. I peered at the rain outside, I looked at my watch and found myself hovering by the reservations desk. We all need an emotional pick-up right now; especially ones we can have mid-afternoon, to be safely off home before the 10pm Covid fairy looms. Perhaps, these days, afternoon tea is actually where it’s at.</p><p>The sedate terrace with its bottle-green velvet chairs, offsetting a tropical mural, was peopled by small tables of jolly, chattering over-60s refusing to be kept indoors and a group of five girlfriends arranging helium balloons, waiting for their final, main guest. Life on the terrace felt gloriously adrift from the unfolding news cycle. Yes, all the usual plans are in place, but it was upbeat and normal, almost. Ten minutes prior to sitting down, I’d liaised with a shadowy figure – a mobile medic working for a TV company – in an alleyway, to do nose and throat swabs, in order to tick insurance forms so I could taste-test mince pies with Phillip Schofield days later. Nothing is normal right now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/23/the-grand-hotel-brighton-afternoon-tea-is-where-its-at-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The reaction from some Conservative MPs to Marcus Rashford’s campaign shows a very different mindset to the one your average parent displays at the school gate<strong><br /></strong></p><p>It was the day after 322 Conservatives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/21/marcus-rashford-in-despair-as-mps-reject-free-school-meal-plan">voted against feeding the nation’s poorest children</a> over the holidays. Social media, indeed all media that way inclined, had been full for many hours of people wondering how these MPs could possibly live with themselves. (The children’s minister! How can a children’s minister vote this way?) Certain Tory MPs – for brevity, the dumb ones – had taken to Twitter themselves to meansplain to the campaigning Marcus Rashford that the responsible stewardship of a nation involves keeping children hungry. Because numbers. And they say so.</p><p>I tried to work out which Tory war game this related to. Are we talking your basic Sun Tzu: when your enemy is choleric, make him angrier by interning 1.3 million kids in a state of famishment? Is it more of a culture war: really whip up that base of people who hate virtue-signalling by selecting one fundamental human virtue, empathy, and kicking it to death? Which Facebook subculture is this meant to appeal to?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/23/how-out-of-touch-are-the-tories-the-free-school-meals-row-tells-you-everything-you-need-to-know">Continue reading...</a>

<p>West Ham came back from 3-0 down so Biden should probably be wary he’s ahead in the polls<br /></p><p>This wasn’t quite the return to north London that either Gareth Bale or Spurs had hoped. Bale had come on in about the 70th<sup> </sup>minute and Tottenham were seemingly cruising to a healthy 3-0 win. A quarter of an hour later and Spurs were hanging on to a 3-2 lead. Then Harry Kane put Bale through and the Welshman did all the hard yards of beating the West Ham left back only to stab the ball wide when it seemed easier to score and put the match to bed. Needless to say, West Ham equalised with the last kick of the game and for several hours afterwards I was almost catatonic with shock and disappointment. Then I calmed down a bit and decided the game must have been one of the most Spursy performances I had ever seen and if Bale had forgotten how football is played in N17 he had been given the perfect reminder. Besides, there was no point getting too upset about snatching a draw from the jaws of victory as there is so much more to get angry about in football. Starting with Sky Sports’ decision to start charging customers, such as myself, an extra £14.95 on top of our ordinary subscriptions to watch selected games. Sky has been reluctant to disclose just how many people have coughed up for the pleasure so far, which rather suggests that no more than a few thousand people are bothering to make the effort. Something that won’t please the advertisers who are presumably being charged an arm and a leg. The Tottenham Hotspur Supporters’ Trust has come up with the ideal solution. Anyone tempted to fork out the £14.95 to Sky should instead make a comparable donation to the <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/tottenham-foodbank">Tottenham </a><a href="https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/tottenham-foodbank">Foodbank</a>.

<p>Bingeing old episodes of Inspector Morse is only the tip of the iceberg for us Brits unable to travel to see our families</p><p>The longest I have gone without seeing England is two years, a hiatus taken after the birth of my children, when I couldn’t face the flight. I must’ve missed the place: I remember bingeing old episodes of Inspector Morse as if they were home movies. But like everything from that period not directly involving babies, I can’t quite retrieve the memory. Besides which, my homesickness was mitigated by one major factor: people came to visit me.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/08/new-york-orthodox-jews-andrew-cuomo-covid-coronavirus">Orthodox New Yorkers condemn Cuomo over new Covid shutdowns</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/23/abroad-coronavirus-homesickness-travel-families">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Balancing sound ethics with financial objectives has never felt more pertinent and urgent, nor has it ever been easier</p><p>Many of us have become more conscious in recent years about whether the money we spend, save and invest is a force for good or ill. But in the face of this year’s global health crisis, it may have felt tempting to put some of our good intentions on the back burner.</p><p>Perhaps how and where you choose to invest any savings is one of the things that’s been relegated down your list of priorities? After all, investing feels focused on the future, whereas this year has demanded immediate crisis management as we concentrate on staying safe, stocked up and solvent. However, there hasn’t been a more pertinent time to embrace impact investing – choosing investments that support positive change for people and the planet. For one thing, in contrast to the 2008 global financial crisis, individuals and institutions alike have been forced this year to confront the full financial fallout of non-financial crises – whether the health pandemic, social inequality or the climate emergency.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/investing-with-impact/2020/oct/23/keen-to-make-an-impact-five-reasons-why-ethical-and-sustainable-investing-might-be-right-for-you-right-now">Continue reading...</a>

Now it’s folding, but were any of its shows worth watching?<br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/23/why-quibi-is-a-cautionary-tale-shortform-netflix">They built it, but people did not come: the cautionary tale of Quibi</a><br /></li></ul><p>Ah, Quibi, we hardly knew ye. The new<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/oct/21/quibi-shut-down-jeffrey-katzenberg-meg-whitman"> streaming platform’s demise this week</a> has left most of us with many questions, such as, “What’s a Quibi?”, “Is it as disgusting as it sounds?” and “Isn’t it Lidl’s own brand version of Angel Delight?” Launched in April this year, Quibi, a portmanteau of “quick” and “bite” (as in, “Quick, bite off my ears, so I never have to hear the word Quibi again”) came promising original short content for our smartphones – although even it must have been surprised by just how short it ended up being. Quibi’s gimmick was that no episode was longer than 10 minutes, because they assumed that’s how millennials like to consume content – watching a tiny bit of a show on a tiny screen in between eating their avocado toast, spinning their Marie Kondo fidget spinner and killing various industries by not being born in the 1960s.</p><p>Why did Quibi collapse? Maybe the pandemic means fewer people are commuting, so fewer people need short-form content. Maybe a dramatically changing world is a bad time to release something new, when people crave the familiar amid the chaos. Or maybe a TV show where people try to recreate a meal that’s been shot at their faces through a cannon isn’t the basis for a successful business. Who can say? Well, me, potentially – in one of my routine attempts to numb my brain from the horrors of reality, I spent last week watching nothing but Quibi.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/23/quick-bye-i-watched-all-of-quibis-quick-bites-so-you-never-have-to">Continue reading...</a>

One of them reminded me that I’d always loved beauty: I spent my childhood listening to my family’s skincare ailments and dispensing what I thought were appropriate lotions. She suggested I do a six-month academy course to get my beauty licence, which would give me the freedom to set up my own business.</p><p>It was exactly the direction I needed. The only problem was that tuition fees were $6,000 (£4,634), which was way out of my budget. I wasn’t eligible for scholarships or funding. To help pay the fees, I got a job as a quality control technician at a construction company. I tested the emulsion that went into the asphalt used to pave roads. It was intense, and I knew I’d have to work long hours to pay the fees for the course. To do both at the same time was going to put me under a lot of pressure. But I’m very stubborn, so I was determined to make it happen, one way or another.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/23/experience-chrissy-teigen-paid-my-college-fees">Continue reading...</a>

I could achieve one alone, but thought I was psychologically unable to do so with another person. I was resigned to faking it.</p><p>A few months ago, I took up daily yoga to cope with the change of pace during lockdown. Soon I was connecting with my body in a way I’d not experienced before. I enjoyed experimenting with my breath.

<p>Only when the centre addresses their concerns will younger generations re-engage with politics<br /></p><p>Across the world, and above all in Britain, the Americas and southern Europe, recent <a href="https://www.bennettinstitute.cam.ac.uk/publications/youth-and-satisfaction-democracy/">research</a> shows that millennials are more dissatisfied with the performance of democracy than previous generations. Moreover, the gap has only worsened with time. When Generation X hit 35, the majority were satisfied with how democracy worked.

<p>Twenty years ago he was one of the world’s hottest young actors, before he retreated – and ended up in Surrey. He explains why he had to leave Hollywood – and what he knew about Harvey Weinstein</p><p>Josh Hartnett is sitting at home in Surrey, thinking about the time he was asked to play Superman. “I had this idea that because he lives in this world where he can’t touch anything without it flying across the room, he has become almost afraid of himself and his own power. He doesn’t know how to be Superman any more. He’s so afraid, he has become almost neutered by the experience of living on Earth, where he can blow things up just by looking at them.”</p><p>The studio demurred – “They didn’t really want a fear-based character at the centre of their movie,” he says wryly – and Hartnett walked away. But his Superman concept now feels like a metaphor for what was happening at the time in his own life, as he became increasingly overwhelmed, even horrified, by his status and the hysteria that surrounded it. Twenty years ago, the hottest young male actors in Hollywood were Leonardo DiCaprio, Will Smith, Matt Damon, Ben Affleck – and Hartnett.

<p>The Italian photographer <strong><a href="http://guiabesana.com/">Guia Besana</a></strong> spent time with students at the world’s oldest childcare training institution, still favoured by the international elite. Her series explores the heritage of Norland College, and the individuals who aspire to work internationally as nannies and nursery nurses </p><p>Norland nannies have become a global status symbol: from the British royal family to George Clooney, the wealthy elite snap up the export of a single British school in Bath, for their children’s care, development and education. The students are dressed in modestly updated uniforms from the one donned by their 1892 counterparts, but the people who wear the uniforms today are considerably different.</p><p>At the prestigious Norland College in Bath, students follow a demanding programme that balances tradition and modernity in order to become the nannies of exception to the elite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/23/modern-mary-poppins-inside-the-elites-nanny-college-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Populism can survive a Trump defeat and a disastrous Brexit. Even so, its best days may already be over</p><p>Over the four feverish years since the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/24/britain-votes-for-brexit-eu-referendum-david-cameron">Brexit vote</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/donald-trump-wins-us-election-news">Donald Trump’s election</a>, we have got used to thinking of populism as a movement whose time has come. Its loudmouth leaders, constant rule-breaking and seductive promises of national renewal have dominated democratic life in much of the world.</p><p>Many people who find populism appalling have also been fascinated, sometimes mesmerised. After the relatively predictable and cautious politics of the 90s and 00s, populism has provided electoral shocks, colourful ideologues, risk-taking governments – and also a potent sense of novelty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/23/rightwing-populists-populism-trump-defeat-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

## US election 2020: Can the Democrats win back trust in Ohio? – podcast

<p>The race in Ohio has long been a reliable guide to the US election: the state’s winner usually goes on to win the presidency. In 2016, it broke decisively for Trump, but this year there are signs that its voters are turning away from the president</p><p>For decades, the mid-western state of Ohio has been one of the classic bellwethers of US elections. Whichever candidate won there could usually expect to enter the White House. It remains true that no Republican candidate has ever taken the presidency without winning Ohio. In 2016, it more than moved towards Donald Trump – he won there by a clear 8 percentage points with promises to revitalise the state and bring back its vanishing industrial jobs. </p><p>This year, those same voters return to the polls amid rising cases of Covid-19, a flatlining economy and scant evidence of returning industry. The Guardian’s <strong>Oliver Laughland </strong>visits the city of Youngstown, where supporters of the president are still loudly confident despite the state now appearing too close to call. For <strong>John Russo</strong>, co-author of Steel Town USA: Work and Memory in Youngstown, there is evidence that working-class voters are deserting Trump amid broken promises and a growing sense of resentment and disengagement with politics. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/23/us-election-2020-can-democrats-win-back-ohio-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
