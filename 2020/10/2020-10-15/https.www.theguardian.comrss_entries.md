<p>The colt’s Derby win is seen by some as a fluke but he could write himself into the history books again on Saturday</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/04/serpentine-pulls-off-huge-shock-with-all-the-way-win-in-the-derby-horse-racing-aidan-obrien">Is this year’s Derby winner</a> good, bad or indifferent? Three-and-a-half months after a Classic at Epsom – which was every bit as strange as the times – no-one is any the wiser, but it is a question that could finally have an answer this weekend after Serpentine was confirmed as one of 11 runners in the Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot on Saturday.</p><p>The bare facts of Serpentine’s five-and-a-half length romp at Epsom in early July suggest are beyond dispute. His winning margin was the widest since Workforce took his field apart by seven lengths in 2010 and that, in turn, was the widest since Shergar’s record-breaking 10-length success in 1981.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/16/talking-horses-serpentine-runs-again-ascot-epsom-derby-winner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A potentially pivotal Merseyside derby, a chance for Man Utd to make changes and a tricky assignment for Chelsea</p><p>Ten years to the day after their most recent win over Liverpool, Everton entertain the Premier League champions at Goodison Park in a top-flight fixture that is about as mouthwatering as they get under the current conditions. Despite the 7-2 defeat to Aston Villa, Liverpool go into the game as odds-on favourites against a side that, under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti, finally appears to have overcome their almost pathological inconsistency. Their white-hot winning streak of seven matches in all competitions since the season began will end at some point, but there are few compelling arguments that suggest it will do so against a team that has looked curiously out of sorts lately. We could learn a lot from this game, not least whether Everton are genuine title contenders in what is already shaping up to be a very peculiar season, and whether the extraordinary humiliation visited upon Liverpool by Aston Villa was an aberration or an early indicator of a far greater malaise. <strong>BG</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/16/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>

It wasn’t just the hot summer euphoria, the flying pints, Three Lions back at No 1 in the charts. It was the sense that this was a vivid, exciting group of players who would only get better with time. Seven of the starting XI for the semi-final in Moscow were aged 25 or younger. By the next Euros in 2020, we assumed, this would be a squad approaching full bloom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/15/southgate-england-class-of-2018-faith-is-showing-diminishing-returns">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Government declares ‘severe’ state of emergency in Bangkok with protest leaders arrested</p><p>Tens of thousands<strong> </strong>of people, including high-school students, gathered in Bangkok on Thursday, defying a ban announced as part of a crackdown on pro-democracy protests.</p><p>Thailand’s prime minister declared a “severe” state of emergency in the capital overnight, as police arrested more than 20 people, including prominent student leaders who have called for monarchy reform. By Thursday afternoon, crowds ignored the ban to assemble at one of the city’s busiest intersections, Ratchaprasong, where they chanted “release our friends” and called police “slaves of dictatorship”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/15/thailand-uses-emergency-decree-to-ban-gatherings-after-bangkok-protests">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Door Matt knows a circuit breaker is the right way to go but he lacks the strength to stand up to Boris</p><p>If Matt Hancock believes in karma, he must be wondering what the hell he did in his previous existence. His fall from grace has been spectacular. Early on in the coronavirus pandemic, Matt looked as if he was one of the few ministers to have grasped the severity of the situation and to be prepared to take the necessary action to contain it. A rare outbreak of responsibility in cabinet. But over the last three or four months, Matt has become Door Matt.</p><p>For a while the health secretary’s one sanctuary was that at least he could claim to be following the science. Even when he missed nearly every testing target and his decision to outsource the track-and-trace system proved disastrous, he could kid himself that he had failed in a more or less scientific way. But even that escape clause for his conscience was snatched away once the prime minister chose to ignore Sage’s recommendation to introduce a circuit breaker in September and then chose not to disclose the evidence until this week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/15/teetering-matt-hancock-ignores-head-and-heart-and-sticks-to-pms-script">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By facing the president head-on when other artists have been oblique, and confronting him on a human level, the US pop star’s song Commander in Chief has intense potency </p><p>How do you solve a problem like Donald? Like Nixon, Reagan and Thatcher before him, President Trump has been a great catalyst for protest in the arts but his villainy is so absurd and flamboyant that it is hard to attack him without stating the obvious. Assaulting him head-on is like staring into the sun. It is no surprise that his most effective satirist is the comedian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/trump-lip-sync-video-memes-sarah-cooper-tiktoks-interview">Sarah Cooper</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/trump-lip-sync-video-memes-sarah-cooper-tiktoks-interview">, who lip-syncs to his own words </a>rather than writing her own.</p><p>In music, to sing about the US these past four years is to allude to the elephant in the White House. Trump’s influence is often oblique: his presence seeps into records like poison gas. In songs such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/07/this-is-america-theories-donald-glover-satirical-video-childish-gambino">Childish Gambino’s This Is America</a>, Kendrick Lamar’s XXX, the 1975’s Love It If We Made It or Hurray for the Riff Raff’s Pa’lante, he is mentioned briefly or not at all. So who would have predicted that one of the most powerful songs about Trump – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9Y-lS1trhw">Demi Lovato’s Commander in Chief</a> – would come so late in the day, and be so direct?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/15/demi-lovato-has-made-the-most-damning-protest-song-of-the-trump-era-commander-in-chief">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Shows such as I May Destroy You, Atlanta and Insecure depict a wide spectrum of black life, from hilarity to mundanity – but all these shows, at times, also have an impending sense of doom. This feeling of horror, this looming sense of dread, is intentional, but it plays on the common tropes we've been conditioned to expect. Josh Toussaint-Strauss discusses why audiences expect bad things to happen to black characters and explores how a new generation of black creators are using horror to subvert these negative tropes&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2020/oct/15/why-horror-keeps-creeping-into-black-drama">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Machines set loose to slaughter’: the dangerous rise of military AI

<p>Autonomous machines capable of deadly force are increasingly prevalent in modern warfare, despite numerous ethical concerns. Is there anything we can do to halt the advance of the killer robots?</p><p>The video is stark. Two menacing men stand next to a white van in a field, holding remote controls. They open the van’s back doors, and the whining sound of quadcopter drones crescendos. They flip a switch, and the drones swarm out like bats from a cave. In a few seconds, we cut to a college classroom. The killer robots flood in through windows and vents. The students scream in terror, trapped inside, as the drones attack with deadly force. The lesson that the film, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HipTO_7mUOw" title="">Slaughterbots</a><em>,</em> is trying to impart is clear: tiny killer robots are either here or a small technological advance away. Terrorists could easily deploy them. And existing defences are weak or nonexistent.</p><p>Some military experts argued that Slaughterbots – which was made by the Future of Life Institute, an organisation researching <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/mar/28/can-we-stop-robots-outsmarting-humanity-artificial-intelligence-singularity" title="">existential threats</a> to humanity – sensationalised a serious problem, stoking fear where calm reflection was required. But when it comes to the future of war, the line between science fiction and industrial fact is often blurry. The US air force has predicted a future in which “Swat teams will send mechanical insects equipped with video cameras to creep inside a building during a hostage standoff”. One “microsystems collaborative” has already released Octoroach, an “extremely small robot with a camera and radio transmitter that can cover up to 100 metres on the ground”. It is only one of many “<a href="https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2018/11/military-by-nature-biomimetic-inspiration-for-future-armies/" title="">biomimetic</a>”, or nature-imitating, weapons that are on the horizon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/oct/15/dangerous-rise-of-military-ai-drone-swarm-autonomous-weapons">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Guardian arts and culture correspondent Lanre Bakare discusses the Mangrove Nine, a group of black activists who found themselves on trial at the Old Bailey in 1971 after protesting against police harassment. Their story became a landmark moment in British history, though many have never heard of it</p><p>The Mangrove restaurant in Notting Hill, London opened in 1968 and quickly became a key meeting place for London’s black community, hosting everyone from intellectuals and activists such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/03/darcus-howe-obituary">Darcus Howe</a> and Altheia Jones-LeCointe to Bob Marley. But its popularity made it a target for west London’s police, who constantly raided the Mangrove, ostensibly to seize drugs that were never found. <strong>J</strong><strong>ebb Johnson, </strong>who used to spend time in the Mangrove during that period, tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about how disturbing the raids were for everyone. </p><p>In 1970, Frank Crichlow, the owner, planned a protest outside west London police stations, but things descended into chaos on the residential Portnall Road, which the police claimed was entirely the fault of the protesters. Crichlow, Jones-LeCointe and Howe were eventually charged, along with Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis, Barbara Beese, Rothwell Kentish and Godfrey Millett. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/15/the-story-of-the-mangrove-nine">Continue reading...</a>
