This video from global superstar Ozuna is a world premiere.\n\nOct. 16, 2020 | Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez -- From a verdant room tucked away in Miami, Ozuna's Tiny Desk performance might allow you, as it did me, to forget for a moment that he's one of the most watched and listened-to artists on earth. For someone whose work often operates at galactic proportions, this performance of five songs makes room for Ozuna's sweet tenor to take center-desk in a love letter to the global communities that supported and streamed him to god tier status.\n\nThe Puerto Rican singer kicks it off with a breezy rendition of \"Caramelo\" that leads into a solo version of the sun-drenched \"Del Mar\" from ENOC, his fourth album that he's deemed a return to his roots. This pared-down performance makes good on that promise, reworking star-studded collaborations, like the ballad \"Despeinada,\" as they should be sung: languorously and with intimacy. Even the pop smash \"Taki Taki\" sounds brand new, buoyed by his alchemical flow and energy.\n\nOzuna is a crown jewel in the global crest of Latin pop, a movement whose modern success in reggaeton and Latin trap is indebted to the Caribbean genres Ozuna heard growing up in Puerto Rico, sounds like old-school reggaeton and reggae en espa\u00f1ol, dembow, dancehall and more. From then to now, Ozuna's bare talent remains his greatest asset. It's rare to see a star of his magnitude brush the earth so closely, and when it does, it's even rarer for it to feel and sound like second nature.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Caramelo\"\n\"Del Mar\"\n\"Despeinada\"\n\"Taki Taki\"\n\"Mamacita\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nOzuna: vocals\nFreddie \"YoFred\" Lugo: bass\nEl\u00ed Bonilla: drums\nCarlos Mercader: guitar\nBenson Pag\u00e1n: guitar\nEdgardo Santiago: keys\nHector Mel\u00e9ndez: piano\nErick \"Yonell\" Pachecho: DJ\nJos\u00e9 Aponte: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Miguel Gonzalez \"UnEnano\"\nDirector: Nuno Gomes\nAudio By: Jose Rivera, Raymond Perez\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nAssociate Producer: Stefanie Fern\u00e1ndez\nAudio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iK1uBBv83M0", "date_published": "2020-10-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Bebel Gilberto: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

But those iconic sights are in fact the perfect visual backdrop for Brazilian music, and Gilberto's in particular.\n\nBebel Gilberto is, of course, the daughter of one of the creators of bossa nova, Jo\u00e3o Gilberto. But as she slinks into the subtle electronic samba of \"Clich\u00e9,\" from her new album Agora, it becomes clear why she is now a standard bearer of Brazilian music. During this concert, she is accompanied by Chico Brown, the son of famed musician Carlinhos Brown and grandson of the legendary Chico Buarque.\n\nYou can feel the presence of all of that Brazilian musical royalty in one of Bebel Gilberto's most popular songs, the closing \"Aganj\u00fa.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Clich\u00e9\"\n\"Na Cara\"\n\"Aganj\u00fa\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBebel Gilberto: vocals\nChico Brown: keys, guitar, percussion, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Cesio Lima, Fabio Fausto, Joao Adams, Antonio Lima\nDirector of Photography: William Andrade\nAudio By: Mauro Bianchi, Antoine Midane at Midanix Studio, Fred Coelho, Thaigo Silverio\nProducer: Felix Contreras\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEK-6cHmmZI", "date_published": "2020-10-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Lyrics On Trial: Mac Phipps (Pt 2) | Louder Than A Riot, S1E3", "description": "\"A bullet in your brain.\" What right does the justice system have to decide whether a rapper's words are imagination or intent to kill? In this continuation of Mac Phipps' story, police pressure witnesses, while prosecutors use the artist's own lyrics to build a murder case against him. And Mac isn't the first: From a century-old folk tune to Ice-T's \"Cop Killer,\" we examine the history of policing Black creativity to reveal a phenomenon that's become common practice in courtrooms \u2014 using lyrics as Exhibit A.\n\nARTWORK by Dale Edwin Murray / MUSIC by Kassa Overall / VIDEO by Renee Klahr\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nWHAT'S \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"?\nRhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. \"Louder Than A Riot\" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles \u2014 the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts, questions and feedback.
