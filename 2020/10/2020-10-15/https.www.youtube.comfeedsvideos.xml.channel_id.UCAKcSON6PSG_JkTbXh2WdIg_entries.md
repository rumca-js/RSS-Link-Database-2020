In "Clouds," the Zach Sobiech biopic debuting Oct. 16 on Disney+, Neve Campbell plays Laura Sobiech - the mother of the young Minnesota man who wrote and recorded the inspiring title song before dying of cancer at age 18. Campbell spoke with The Current's Jay Gabler about what it was like to explore this challenging role, and about her newfound friendship with the real-life woman she portrayed onscreen.
