Despite the 7-2 defeat to Aston Villa, Liverpool go into the game as odds-on favourites against a side that, under the stewardship of Carlo Ancelotti, finally appears to have overcome their almost pathological inconsistency. Their white-hot winning streak of seven matches in all competitions since the season began will end at some point, but there are few compelling arguments that suggest it will do so against a team that has looked curiously out of sorts lately. We could learn a lot from this game, not least whether Everton are genuine title contenders in what is already shaping up to be a very peculiar season, and whether the extraordinary humiliation visited upon Liverpool by Aston Villa was an aberration or an early indicator of a far greater malaise. <strong>BG</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/16/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/16/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend", "date_published": "2020-10-15 23:01:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Birmingham 2022 condenses athletics schedule in bid to attract top names", "description": "<ul><li>Commonwealth Games to open with T20 cricket at Edgbaston</li><li>Event sandwiched by World and European championships</li></ul><p>The organisers of Birmingham 2022 believe they have negotiated a schedule that will allow top athletes to compete at the Commonwealth Games, but a date when tickets will be sold to the public is still uncertain.</p><p>Despite a summer set for an overload of sporting events, with the Commonwealth Games starting only three days after the World Athletics Championships conclude on 24 July, organisers remain confident that star performers such as Dina Asher-Smith and Katarina Johnson-Thompson will still be able to take part.
