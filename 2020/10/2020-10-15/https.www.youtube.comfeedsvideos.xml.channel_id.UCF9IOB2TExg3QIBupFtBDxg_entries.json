October)\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.07.20208645v1\n\nZinc balances immune responses and also has a proven direct antiviral action against some viruses.\n\nZinc deficiency (ZD) is a common condition in elderly and individuals with chronic diseases\n\nIncreased intracellular zinc concentrations efficiently impair replication\n\nResulting in a lower number of viruses\n\nRetrospective analysis\n\nPatients admitted in Barcelona\n\n15th March to 30th April 2020\n\nClinical severity of COVID-19 and PMH assessed\n\nFasting plasma zinc levels measured routinely at admission\n\nN = 611\n\nMean age, 63 years\n\nMale 332, (55%) \n\nTotal mortality was 87 patients (14%) during study time\n\nBut\n\n249 of 611 patients studied\n\nOf the 249, 21 (8%) died\n\nBaseline zinc levels\n\nDied, (21 people) mean plasma zinc = 43 \u03bcg/dl\n\nSurvived, (228 people) mean plasma zinc = 63.1 \u03bcg/dl\n\nHigher zinc levels, associated with lower maximum levels of interleukin-6 during the period of active infection\n\nZinc level lower than 50 \u03bcg/dl at admission, 2.3 times increased risk of in-hospital death\n\nCompared with those of 50 \u03bcg/dl or higher\n\nLower zinc levels at admission correlate with higher inflammation in the course of infection and poorer outcome \n\nLow plasma zinc levels at admission are associated with mortality in COVID-19 in our study \n\nFurther studies are needed to assess the therapeutic impact of this association\n\nCOVID-19: Poor outcomes in patients with zinc deficiency (International Journal of

coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\n\nPatients with serious COVID-19 had significantly low zinc levels in comparison to healthy controls\n\nZinc deficient COVID patients developed more complications\n\nZinc deficient patients 70.4% developed complications\n\nNon zinc deficient patients, 30.0% developed complications, (p = 0.009)\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome\n\nMore need of steroids\n\nIncreased mortality\n\nZinc deficient COVID patients had a prolonged hospital stay\n\nZinc deficient patients, 7.9 days\n\nNon zinc deficient patients, 5.7 days, (p = 0.048)\n\nIn vitro

zinc does\n\nCatalytic activity of approximately 100 enzymes \n\nPlays a role in immune function\n\nProtein synthesis\n\nWound healing\n\nDNA synthesis \n\nCell division\n\nNormal growth and development, pregnancy, childhood, adolescence\n\nRequired for sense of taste and smell\n\nZinc and immunity\n\nSevere zinc deficiency depresses immune function\n\nEven mild to moderate degrees of zinc deficiency can impair macrophage and neutrophil functions, natural killer cell activity, and complement activity\n\nBody requires zinc to develop and activate T-lymphocytes\n\nLow zinc levels have shown reduced lymphocyte proliferation\n\n\u2026. that can be corrected by zinc supplementation \n\nLow zinc status has been associated with increased susceptibility to pneumonia and other infections in children in developing countries and the elderly\n\nFoods\nOysters\nSea food\nBeef\nPork\nBaked beans\nFortified cereals\nPumpkin seeds\nYogurt\nCashew
