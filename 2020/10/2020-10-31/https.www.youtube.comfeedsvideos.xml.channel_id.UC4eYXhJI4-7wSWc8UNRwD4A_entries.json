While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Gabriel Kahane\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2011: https://www.npr.org/2011/11/26/142514755/gabriel-kahane-tiny-desk-concert\n\nTom Huizenga | November 26, 2011\nGabriel Kahane seems to enjoy blurring the lines between indie rock and indie classical. He arrived at the NPR Music offices with a string quartet and an electric guitarist in tow, and though they hadn't played together for long, you'd never know it. That says something about these musicians (one of whom, the violist Caleb Burhans, is a terrific young composer), because Kahane's songs are rigorously crafted \u2014 some with the insight and wit of Schubert lieder, but telling decidedly more contemporary stories.\n\nThe tongue-in-cheek \"Charming Disease,\" for example, is a bleak portrait of a struggling alcoholic (\"You were on the floor when I got home / Scraped you up, cleaned you off, got you out the door\") with a catchy hook. But with its see-sawing, minimalist piano chords, shifting harmonies and unexpected melodic curves, it feels right to call it a composition.\n\nThe classical music thing comes naturally to Kahane. His father, Jeffrey Kahane, is a celebrated concert pianist and music director of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra. Kahane, like his dad, plays piano, but also guitar \u2014 and he sings with a voice that's lithe and expressive. He writes chamber music, lighthearted pop songs and commissions for orchestras like the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\n\nThe music Kahane performs here is all from his recent album, Where Are the Arms, a suite of 11 smart songs that weave in, out and between pop, rock and classical, covering a broad range of emotions. The title track is a wistful plea, anchored by delicately repeating guitar arpeggios.\n\n\"Last Dance,\" which closes this Tiny Desk Concert, unreels in three little scenes, like a miniature opera. Kahane sings the recitative-like descriptions of his protagonist's daily routines, and then he pauses to launch a song within the song, a kind of pulsating pop fugue that ends in a satisfying cadence.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Charming Disease\"\n\"Where Are The Arms\"\n\"Last Dance\"\n\nCREDITS\nMichael Katzif, Cristina Fletes (cameras); edited by Michael Katzif; audio by Kevin Wait; photo by Cristina Fletes/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwCd9yxgtwc", "date_published": "2020-11-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Amplify with Lara Downes: Anthony McGill", "description": "Lara Downes | October 31, 2020\n\nAnthony McGill is a musician's musician. You might remember his performance with Yo-Yo Ma, Itzhak Perlman and Gabriela Montero at President Obama's inauguration in 2009. You might have seen him leading the clarinet section at the New York Philharmonic, or as a soloist on stages around the world. Or maybe you've heard that he's won the 2020 Avery Fisher Prize, a $100,000 award given to a musician \"whose vision and leadership expand the reach of classical music.\"\n\nAnthony extends his reach even further as he joins me to talk about the intersection of artistry and activism and the surprising paths we sometimes take to get there.\n\nOn May 27, two days after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, McGill picked up his clarinet and offered a musical response to systemic racism and violence. He asked his fellow musicians to join him with these words: \"This time, let's try and take two knees in the struggle for justice and decency. No guidelines. Your message, your voice, your mission, your focus. Just two knees for what you believe in. Pass it along.\"\n\nAnd we did. From our homes around the country, we poured out our grief and rage into hundreds of quiet, solo performances. Together they sounded a lot like transformation \u2014 from what Martin Luther King called the \"jangling discords of our nation\" into \"a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-lQ6Jl3DhM", "date_published": "2020-10-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
