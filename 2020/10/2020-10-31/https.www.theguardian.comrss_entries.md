<ul><li>France 35-27 Ireland</li><li>Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack impress for runners-up</li></ul><p>No miracles in Paris, but France were almost more impressive in winning by less than the 31-point margin that would have brought them the title. They were happy to let <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/31/france-ireland-six-nations-match-report">that gong head to England</a>, because winning with authority against a more experienced side with a far more realistic directive seemed of greater priority to them than chasing an unlikely dream.</p><p>France claimed the bonus-point win they needed, but the eight-point margin of victory was well shy of that required. Still, the consistency of brilliance of their young half-backs, Antoine Dupont and Romain Ntamack, in particular, is starting to impress. Couple that with a resolute defence, now marshalled by Shaun Edwards, the master thereof, and France look serious.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/31/france-ireland-six-nations-final-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dutch great played on until, aged 28, he could stand the pain from his damaged ankle no more. ‘I went from football’s highest level down to the lowest level of personal unhappiness’ </p><p>In 1994, in the middle of the night, <a href="https://www.footballhistory.org/player/marco-van-basten.html" title="">Marco van Basten</a> would often crawl from his bed to the bathroom. The pain in his damaged ankle was so bad that, to divert his attention, he would count the seconds it took him to cover the short but agonising distance. He remembers: “Whispering, I never reach the toilet before I get to 120. The door sills are the most challenging part because my ankle has to go over them without touching them. Even the slightest touch makes me bite my lip to prevent a scream.”</p><p>Two years earlier, Van Basten had won the Ballon D’Or for the third time while also being named Fifa’s world player of the year. “It was very difficult because I went from the highest level in football down to the lowest level of personal unhappiness,” he says. “It was a very big fall and a really dark time.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/31/marco-van-basten-it-was-a-very-big-fall-and-a-really-dark-time">Continue reading...</a>

Just as physical gigs used to warn people about strobe lights, Billie Eilish’s debut live stream might have included a trigger warning for anyone to whom a 10ft <a href="https://cultmtl.com/2020/10/montreal-moment-factory-created-incredible-xr-visuals-for-billie-eilish-where-do-we-go-livestream/">scuttling </a><a href="https://cultmtl.com/2020/10/montreal-moment-factory-created-incredible-xr-visuals-for-billie-eilish-where-do-we-go-livestream/">“extended reality”</a><a href="https://cultmtl.com/2020/10/montreal-moment-factory-created-incredible-xr-visuals-for-billie-eilish-where-do-we-go-livestream/"> spider</a> might give pause.</p><p>You suspect, though, that this mischievous, boundary-pushing artist would really love to provoke a neurological as well as an emotional reaction in her fans. The hairy nightmare vision stalks the 18-year-old singer as she moves around the stage – constructed as a hi-tech 3D green screen – singing <a href="https://youtu.be/Ah0Ys50CqO8">You Should See Me </a><a href="https://youtu.be/Ah0Ys50CqO8">in </a><a href="https://youtu.be/Ah0Ys50CqO8">a Crown</a>. A many-jointed leg just misses impaling Eilish by a hair’s breadth every time. The massive spider – one of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG0XSh2hXQz/?utm_source=ig_embed..">a number of VR-like scenarios created for this streamed performance</a> – recalls its smaller brethren from the track’s 2019 video. Tonight, its shape also visually echoes the two sharp-angled silhouetted rigs that bookend the singer: Eilish’s brother and writing partner Finneas on keyboards to the left and the duo’s drummer, Andrew Marshall, to the right. The track comprehensively nails Eilish’s best creepy trap-pop, her commitment to fear – either subjectively felt or objectively provoked – and her love of insider references.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/31/billie-eilish-where-do-we-go-livestream-concert-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A cosy duo of comforting autumnal recipes: a red lentil dal with carrots, pumpkin and fried ginger, and sweet-and-sour pork tempered with ginger and curry leaves </p><p> Autumn is a spectacular season, with its brightly coloured squashes and warm flavours. Unfussy, richly flavoured braises and stews sit bubbling on hot stoves. This week, I bring you a ginger-laced dal cooked with carrots and pumpkins, and a sweet-sour braised pork inspired by the coastal cooking I grew up with in India. These are meals that can be eaten at the dinner table, but which are also wonderful if you’re curled up on the sofa under a blanket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/31/nik-sharma-recipes-for-autumn-comfort-dishes-lentil-dal-braised-pork">Continue reading...</a>

Afterwards, they wished they’d pushed him harder – they should have insisted – but he was the prime minister and his mind was made up. He refused to believe a fellow citizen might pose a mortal threat.</p><p>And so a quarter of a century ago, on the night of 4 November 1995, Yitzhak Rabin stood before a vast and grateful crowd in Tel Aviv at a peace rally, protected by nothing more than a jacket, tie and white cotton shirt. The size of the rally had surprised him: he was a shy man, awkward with attention, and he had doubted that thousands of Israelis would come out to show support for him and his attempt to make peace with the Palestinians. He told aides he feared the city’s central plaza – not yet called Rabin Square – would be empty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/31/assassination-yitzhak-rabin-never-knew-his-people-shot-him-in-back">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Described as ‘gorgeous’ by the man who found it, the great fox-spider has not been seen since 1993</p><p>One of Britain’s largest spiders has been discovered on a Ministry of Defence training ground in Surrey having not been seen in the country for 27 years.</p><p>The great fox-spider is a night-time hunter, known for its speed and agility, as well as its eight black eyes which give it wraparound vision. The critically endangered spider was assumed extinct in Britain after last being spotted in 1993 on Hankley Common in Surrey. The two-inch-wide (5cm) arachnid had previously also been spotted at two sites in Morden Heath in Dorset. These are the only three areas in Britain, all in the comparatively warmer south, where it has been recorded.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/31/huge-spider-assumed-extinct-in-britain-discovered-on-mod-site-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ever since Americanah, I’ve wondered when Adichie would give us more fiction. Zikora, published this week, is the perfect answer</p><p>I’ll take pretty much anything from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her words, even her tweets, somehow flow in a way that is so lyrical, light and playful that I hear her voice in my head when I’m reading them. It was announced, quite quietly, this week that she’d written “Zikora”, a short story about the complications that black women face during childbirth; it would be published the next day.</p><p>I didn’t know what to do with myself. This is the first official piece of fiction she has written since the novel <em>Americanah</em>, published in 2013. I and the rest of the readers who consider her to be the cornerstone of the literature that makes us feel seen have been waiting for a <em>very</em> long time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/31/chimamanda-ngozi-adichies-new-short-story-is-what-ive-been-waiting-for">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Simple and immensely satisfying, just one shadow can carry a whole face</p><p>I’m obsessed with single eyeshadows. I love a big palette, I really do, but in much the same way as I love a beautiful white shirt I wear once before remembering I don’t iron, then rarely put on again. But there is no makeup easier, or more satisfying, than a single pan of powder eyeshadow in one chic, instantly face-improving tone of nudey brown nothingness. Add one eyeliner, and you have my everyday look since March – because in times of little joy and no lipstick under masks, a single shadow can carry a whole face.</p><p>I tried umpteen this summer, and decided that before I ruled <a href="https://www.maccosmetics.co.uk/product/13840/363/products/makeup/eyes/eyeshadow/eyeshadow#!/shade/Soft_Brown" title="">MAC’s Soft Brown</a> (more of a malted peach, and perfect with everything) my overall winner, I’d ask my readers <a href="https://www.instagram.com/salihughes/?hl=en" title="">on Instagram</a> to tell me which eyeshadow they could use solely for the rest of their lives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/oct/31/the-best-single-eyeshadows">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester City forward with an ‘I refuse to sink’ tattoo was fast-tracked but not always memorable to teammates</p><p>The usual routine here is for a former teammate to talk about how good Ferran Torres was, how he made an immediate impact and everyone knew that he was going to be a star from the very first day, especially him. How he came on for his debut and left everyone open-mouthed. Things, though, don’t always turn out as you expect. “I can’t even remember, to be honest,” says one member of the Mestalla side the day the 16-year-old played his first game with them in Spain’s third tier, a 2-0 defeat by Mallorca B in October 2016.</p><p>He didn’t stand out, then? “Not with us he didn’t,” the player says, and then starts laughing. “Seemed a nice kid, quiet. Very good in training, I do remember that. To be fair, he wasn’t with us long.” Soon Torres was moving on: fast-tracked into Mestalla, Valencia’s B team, he was moved to the first team quickly too, long identified as <em>the</em> player in an academy with an impressive record of producing players, including Jordi Alba, Isco and the man Torres admired as a kid and whose No 21 shirt he took at Manchester City: David Silva.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/31/ferran-torres-manchester-city-valencia-story-behind-his-rise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If your cream seems on the turn, there’s no need to waste it</p><p>Although I try to curtail my consumption of cream, I’m the kind of person who likes to pour it on everything – into coffee, over cereal and, if I’m feeling particularly greedy, I might just drink it straight from the carton.</p><p>Cream rarely expires in our household, yet, when it does get close to expiration, rather than chuck it out, we make soured cream, extending its shelf-life by up to 10 days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/31/cream-past-its-best-turn-it-into-soured-cream-tom-hunt-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

On the ceiling, the silhouette of a tree branch is waving in the light cast by next door’s security light.

<p>Five years ago, Candice Pires and her family moved to the ‘liberal, laid-back’ US city of Portland. Would the shockwaves of 2020 spell the end of their lives there?</p><p>It was Labor Day. We were having a barbecue in our back garden when gale-force winds started out of nowhere. As we scrambled to hold down plates and glasses, our neighbour’s horse chestnut trees swayed menacingly, their leaves swirling around us.</p><p>Over the next hour, smoke filled the air and the sky changed from bright blue to dirty grey. We moved everything inside and shut up the house. Soon after, the power went.

<p><strong>Llanberis, Gwynedd:</strong> They felt at the initial holds, arms taking their weight, toes stabbing at edges and pockets that might afford some lift<br /></p><p>Driving up the Llanberis Pass on a grey afternoon, my eye was caught by a group of young people gazing intently at one of the huge roadside boulders near Pont y Gromlech, and I pulled into a layby to watch them at their sport. They belonged to the rock-climbing sub-sect of “boulderers”, and were focused on a leaning wall of pocketed rock perhaps five metres high.</p><p>Clothed in T-shirts and loose trousers, with sticky rubber rock slippers on their feet, they had chalk bags strung round their waists, and thick foam crash mats laid out beneath the wall. Each in turn stepped to the base of the wall and went through a set of mimetic gestures anticipating the moves to be made above. They felt at the initial holds, arms taking their weight, toes stabbing at edges and pockets that might afford some lift, then flopped more or less elegantly back on to the mats beneath.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/31/country-diary-boulderers-make-the-most-of-the-rocky-terrain">Continue reading...</a>
