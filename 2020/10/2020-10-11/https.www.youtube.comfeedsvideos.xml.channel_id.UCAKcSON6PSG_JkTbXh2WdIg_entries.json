In February 2020, just before the pandemic took hold, Heart Bones \u2014 fronted by the duo of Sean Tillmann and Sabrina Ellis \u2014 visited The Current studio to perform songs from their album, \"Hot Dish.\" A tour was meant to follow, but global events dictated otherwise. Nevertheless, enjoy this spirited and catchy performance that will get you dancing along with the band.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Open Relations\"\n4:03 \"I Like Your Way\"\n7:26 \"Don\u2019t Read the Comments\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nSabrina Ellis - vocals\nSean Tillmann - vocals and guitar\nAaron Baum - synthesizer and vocals\nRyan Mach - drums and percussion\nAdam Hurlburt - bass and guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Jesse Wiza\n\nFIND MORE:\n2018 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/11/20/heart-bones-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2019 performance at The Current's Day Party during SXSW 2019: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/03/15/watch-heart-bones-perform-at-the-current-day-party-in-austin-texas-sxsw\n2019 Rock The Garden performance:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/07/19/watch-heart-bones-double-your-pleasure-at-rock-the-garden\n2020 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/02/18/heart-bones-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#heartbones #seantillmann #sabrinaellis", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENRB4IKc7g4", "date_published": "2020-10-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
