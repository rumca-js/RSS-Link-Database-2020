## Get up and go: is 54 really the age we lose our passion for life?

<p>You need a combination of passion and grit to maintain a positive mindset. But a Norwegian study has found that by the time we reach our mid-50s we don’t seem to possess both</p><p><strong>Name:</strong> Get Up and Go.<br /><br /><strong>Appearance</strong>: Lively, bold, adventurous. <br /><br /><strong>Age:</strong> 54.<br /><br /><strong>I could swear the concept is older than that.</strong> Apparently not. <br /><br /><strong>Are you saying that until 54 years ago there was no such thing as get up and go?</strong> No, I’m saying that people over the age of 53 don’t have any. <br /><br /><strong>Well I am over 53 and I like to think I have still got plenty of get up and go.</strong> You like to think wrong. Your get up and go has got up and gone. <br /><br /><strong>What do you mean by “get up and go”, exactly?</strong> Your passion, your grit, your drive to try new things and achieve fresh goals. All dried up, sadly. <br /><br /><strong>No doubt it is a common enough problem, but surely the age at which it </strong><strong>dries up varies widely from person to person?</strong> Nope. It’s 54. <br /><br /><strong>Who says?</strong> A Norwegian study published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X20301240?via%3Dihub">New Ideas in Psychology</a>, that has examined the relation between passion, “grit” and a positive mindset across a lifespan. <br /><br /><strong>And what did it find?</strong> That the correlation between grit and passion were strong between the ages of 17 and 53, but in the 54 to 69 group the correlation was “trivial”.<br /><br /><strong>I have no idea what you are talking about.</strong> You may well have a high score for grit and a low one for passion, or vice versa. These intertwined qualities are needed for high achievement, but the over-53s don’t seem to possess them as a package. <br /><br /><strong>Nonsense. How are they even defining passion?</strong> As “a strong desire or enthusiasm for something”.</p><p><strong>Yeah, I used to have that. And grit?</strong> As a quality of endurance “characterised by exertion or diligence”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/28/get-up-and-go-is-54-really-the-age-we-lose-our-passion-for-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Kitty was seven months old but fearless. She’d saunter out on deck in a storm, and hunt seagulls bigger than she was’</p><p>This was shot in my third season crab fishing on a vessel called Rollo. King crab season in the Bering Sea, off Alaska, usually starts mid-October and lasts for several weeks, but it can be as little as one week – it depends on weather, luck and skill. When the season is finished, everyone goes in to Dutch Harbor and waits to offload their catch. There can be about 350 other boats filled up with crab. Sometimes you queue for eight days.</p><p>Everyone looks forward to Halloween. You get a bunch of crabbers in a bar and it gets pretty crazy. I’d bought this horse-head costume in advance and, as we were cruising in to Dutch Harbor, my friend Matthew and I were trying out costumes. I took some pictures of him wearing the mask, then my cat came walking by and Matthew grabbed her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/28/corey-arnold-best-shot-horse-cat-fishing-crab-alaska">Continue reading...</a>

<p>News and design stories from around the world, including kids’ creative take on Boris Johnson and the plywood renaissance </p><p>As lockdown confusion reigns and rules about where you can go and at what time change every day, there’s one thing that has become clear. The creative community are rising to the challenges of the Covid crisis. In the US, new initiatives have turned the plywood boards nailed to shopfronts during lockdown into creative opportunities for artists and local communities. One architecture firm is using discarded plywood to make street furniture for restaurants. In the UK, designer Jonny Banger has joined with artist Jeremy Deller to let children vent their feelings about lockdown and create a unique exhibition.

<p>Hopes are high that the overwhelming vote to overturn the Pinochet-era constitution marks the beginning of a new era</p><p>On Sunday, Chileans voted overwhelmingly in favour of establishing a new constitution. After one year of almost continuous social and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/oct/24/democracy-chile-protesters-pinera-pinochet">violent protests</a>, the country erupted upon hearing the news with the kind of jubilant parties and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/26/chile-vote-scrap-pinochet-constitution">street celebrations</a> that were last seen when a 1989 plebiscite put an end to the 17-year dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet.</p><p>Chile’s current constitution was written by Pinochet’s adviser and rightwing ideologue Jaime Guzmán, and was approved at the time by a rigged referendum. When Chile subsequently became a democracy in 1990, authoritarian principles enshrined in this constitution constrained the country’s process of democratisation and imposed a neoliberal model of economic development. The constitution had allowed Pinochet to nominate senators, established a voting system that initially overrepresented the political right, and required supermajorities for reforming institutions such as the armed forces and education system. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/28/chile-democracy-pinochet-constitution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>If ministers can’t see the role of structural racism in the first wave, history will repeat itself in the second</p><p>Since the start of the pandemic the government has produced a series of reports on the impact of Covid-19. One statistic that has received a lot of attention is its disproportionate impact on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people">Black and Asian populations</a>. While there has been general agreement about the data – that where you live, the number of people in your household, the type of job you do, how you travel to work and a range of co-morbidities, are the main contributors to death from Covid-19 – there has been a reluctance in these reports to mention the role of race in any meaningful way.</p><p>Following the publication of the report on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/key-findings-from-public-health-englands-report-on-covid-19-deaths">C</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/key-findings-from-public-health-englands-report-on-covid-19-deaths">ovid-19 health disparities</a> in June, the minister for equalities, Kemi Badenoch, supported by the Race Disparity Unit (RDU), was put in charge of cross-government work on the next steps. Yet this race unit, selected by No 10, includes a number of Black and Asian people who appear little inclined to attribute any disparities based on race to discrimination. Badenoch herself, though a black woman, accused a BBC journalist of <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Crox/status/1269564164487421953">fanning racial tensions</a> simply for exposing the impact of Covid-19 on Britain’s racial minorities.

<p>There are chills galore in this enjoyable 70s-set debut about disturbed teenagers and malevolent spirits</p><p>Tim and Abi Smith are teenage twins growing up in a lower middle-class household in the early 1970s. They are obsessed with ghosts, but also with “standing stones, witches, curses, the British countryside, the ancient Egyptians […] the Vikings, voodoo, vampires, the mythical giant squid, real-life accounts of people being attacked (and, even better, devoured) by large wild animals, Dracula, <em>Doctor Who</em>, space exploration, the futuristic domed cities that people would one day live in on the ocean floor”, et cetera. They decide to fake a photo of a ghost in their attic and – guess what? – terrible consequences ensue.</p><p><em>The Apparition Phase</em> is Will Maclean’s first novel. Already a successful TV writer, he certainly knows how to twist and turn. With their fake ghost photo, Tim and Abi release some kind of malevolent spirit into the world, which soon leads to Abi going missing, Tim going crazy, their parents separating, and before you know it poor Tim is being hauled off by a bunch of hippy paranormal researchers in corduroy and kaftans holding seances in a big old haunted house in the Suffolk countryside and it’s Hammer Horror time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/28/the-apparition-phase-by-will-maclean-review-unleashing-ghosts">Continue reading...</a>

## Bournemouth's Jack Stacey: juggling football with a six-year degree

<p>Defender combines playing with studying business and economics, a journey sparked because he had no wifi</p><p>“There was a point last season where I let it get on top of me a bit,” says the Bournemouth defender Jack Stacey, sharing a story symbolic of the sacrifice sometimes required when juggling a business and economics degree with a burgeoning football career. “We were playing Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on the Saturday and I had an assignment due on the Monday. We ended up winning 1-0 and a few of the lads were going into London for a meal to celebrate. I had to say no because I had to go home and finish my assignment … there are a few times that has happened,” he adds, smiling.</p><p>Stacey is five years into a six-year Open University course – “I can almost see the finish line now” – that he started while on loan from Reading at Exeter City, when home was a wooden cabin at Fingle Glen golf course near Dartmoor, where the club sometimes house new signings. “When you are in League Two, you always have to think long term. There was no wifi there so I couldn’t go and watch Netflix or play PS4 so I started looking into other options, and I’d already done my A-levels so it was something that appealed. After training, I enjoy having something to help switch off from football. I work Monday-Friday, an hour to an hour and a half each day, so I get the weekend off. I would advise any player to look into it and see if it’s for them or not.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/28/bournemouth-jack-stacey-juggling-football-with-a-six-year-degree">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Galleries, museums and cafes are shifting their focus to offer visitors Covid-safe experiences outside, even through winter</p><p>In a remote corner of the Yorkshire Dales, there’s an unusual sight among the farm animals this winter. On the terrace of the Courtyard Dairy cheese shop, next to a colourful cow sculpture, sit a pair of Alpine intruders. The interlopers are not of the four-legged variety; they are ski gondolas, once used to whisk holidaymakers up the pistes of Courchevel in the French Alps. Now, these snug pods offer visitors the chance to feast on Alpine specialities such as <em>raclette</em> and fondue.</p><p>For owner Andy Swinscoe, bringing his cafe outside has been a lifeline in a bleak period. Around 75% of his business was lost during lockdown. Since then, the cafe and museum that had made the dairy a Dales’ destination for tourists have had to remain closed. Over summer, he introduced a cheese vending machine and started selling takeaway coffee and ice-cream, but says: “We felt like without the cafe, even though it was not the biggest part of our business, we had lost our appeal. Because we are in the middle of nowhere, we needed that draw to get people to us.” Andy invested in the gondolas in July and because they are socially distanced and protected from the elements, they’ve been a hit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/oct/28/uk-tourism-venues-embrace-the-great-outdoors-to-survive-the-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

It felt fresh and contemporary in a way that so few films did at the time, centering teens and dismissing adults, a simple yet magnetic formula that gave it an immediate, impassioned fanbase who felt spoken to rather than spoken down to.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/28/spell-review-hokey-hoodoo-horror-missing-a-bit-of-magic">Spell review – hokey hoodoo horror missing a bit of magic</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/28/the-craft-legacy-review-horror-sequel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian’s West Africa correspondent Emmanuel Akinwotu reports from the protests against the special anti-robbery squad (Sars), which have swept Nigeria and gained international support. For years, the police unit has been plagued with allegations of extrajudicial killings and abuse</p><p>The Guardian’s West Africa correspondent<strong> Emmanuel Akinwotu</strong> tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys</strong> about the wave of protests which have erupted across Nigeria and captured global attention. The cries for change in Nigeria, largely from a younger generation, have centred around calls for an end to the notorious special anti-robbery squad (Sars), a police unit who have long been accused of extrajudicial killings, torture and extortion.</p><p>Last week, according to witnesses, dozens of soldiers disembarked from at least four trucks flanked by police officers and approached the scene of a major protest site where more than a thousand people had taken over a toll gate in Lekki, a large district in Lagos Island. Amnesty International said at least 12 people were killed by soldiers and police in the shootings which left many in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/nigeria">Nigeria</a> and across the world reeling. The visibility of the carnage, which has since been widely described as the “Lekki Massacre”, has fuelled outrage at the Nigerian government and security forces for clamping down on one of the most striking protest movements in decades in Nigeria. In an effort to quell unrest, the government announced the unit would be disbanded, and promised a host of reforms. But many demonstrators are sceptical of government promises without clearly specified timeframes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/28/the-fight-to-endsars-in-nigeria">Continue reading...</a>
