Tamoor breaks down the biggest details about the upcoming Demon's Souls Remake from his interview with the Creative Director from SIE Worldwide Studios, Gavin Moore.

The Demon's Souls remake for PS5 is an exciting prospect for longtime fans and newcomers alike. It offers the chance to relive a beautiful new version of From Software's seminal Souls game or to check out the game that laid out the template for From Software's titles for the first time. 

But, naturally, there are a lot of questions surrounding the details of the remake effort. After all, it's being handled by Bluepoint Games, alongside Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. Bluepoint Games is called the master of the remaster, having knocked it out of the park with Shadow of the Colossus and Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, among others. But a completely remade Souls game not involving From Software still makes fans nervous. 

Thankfully, I was able to talk to Gavin Moore, creative director at SIE Worldwide Studios External Development, and get some answers to a few of my big questions. Having done so, I feel a little more at ease about the game, especially having learned about some of the new features and tweaks. So, settle in, here's eight things you need to know about the remake.

Ubisoft has delayed Far Cry 6 and Rainbow Six Quarantine, CD Projekt Red boss comments on Cyberpunk's latest delay, and Todd Howard weighs in on whether or not he thinks The Elder Scrolls 6 will be an Xbox exclusive. 

Ubisoft has announced that it is delaying two of its biggest upcoming games: Far Cry 6 and Rainbow Six Quarantine. They will no longer release in the current fiscal year, instead launching between April 2021 and March 2022. The delays are due to complications related to the developers working from home. 

Cyberpunk 2077 was recently delayed to December 10, and CD Projekt Red's CEO Adam Kicinski has revealed why. On an investor call, he said that despite passing certification from Microsoft and Sony, the developer wasn't happy with how the game ran on PS4 and Xbox One. If you're itching for more Cyberpunk while you wait, we've got loads of lore videos for you to check out right now. 

Bethesda's Todd Howard finds it "hard to imagine" that the upcoming Elder Scrolls 6 would be an Xbox exclusive after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media last month. Bethesda will also continue to publish its own games, and Howard commented that their partnership seems to be based more around the benefits of Game Pass for developers.

With a retail Xbox Series X and S in our hands, we stack an Xbox tower, and compare Microsoft's newest console to every launch Xbox console.

The next generation is just around the corner, and we've had our hands on the new Xbox Series X and Series S for a while now. The new consoles from Microsoft are relatively understated, with black and white boxes that look simple and clean. But how do they compare to prior Xboxes? Time to do science!

We took the Xbox Series X and Series S and stacked them up against every prior Xbox, from the original Xbox all the way to the Xbox One X. In fact, thanks to the relatively squared edges in every generation of Xbox, we were also able to literally stack them against each other, making a gigantic Xbox sandwich. It's a sight to behold, but we don't recommend taking a bite. Check out the full console size comparison.
