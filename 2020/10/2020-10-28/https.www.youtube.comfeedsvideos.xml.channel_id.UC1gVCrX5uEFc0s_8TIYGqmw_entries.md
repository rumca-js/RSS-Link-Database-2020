In the South of France, the game evolved into jeu provençal (or boule lyonnaise), in which players rolled their boules or ran three steps before throwing a boule. The game was extremely popular in France in the second half of the 19th century.

This movie was filmed by Louis Lumiere in 1896 at his vacation residence Clos des Plages in La Ciotat. Here you can get more information about this palace (French language).
