Coronavirus antibody prevalence falling in England, REACT study shows (Imperial college and Ipsos MORI, 27th October)

N = 365,000 antibody tests

Positive tests = 17,576 

30% of whom did not report any COVID-19 symptoms

20 June and 28 September 

Three rounds

Decline between rounds 1 and 3 in all age groups

Decline was largest in people who didn’t report a history of COVID-19

Asymptomatics

Dropped by 64.0% between rounds one and three

Antigen diagnosed group

Decrease of 22.3% between rounds one and three

Overall decline

Percentage testing positive, 6.0% to 4.8% and then 4.4% (a 26.5% reduction across the study period) 

All areas of the country and age groups, but higher in London (9% at round 3)

But not in health workers

Decline was largest in people 75 and older

Professor Paul Elliott

Our study shows that over time there is a reduction in the proportion of people testing positive for antibodies. 

Testing positive for antibodies does not mean you are immune to COVID-19. 

It remains unclear what level of immunity antibodies provide, or for how long this immunity lasts. 

If someone tests positive for antibodies:

they still need to follow national guidelines including …

social distancing measures

getting a swab test if they have symptoms

and wearing face coverings where required

Implications for immunity

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls (Nature 15th July)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z?flip=true

Memory T cells induced by previous pathogens can greatly influence future infections

Individuals convalescing from COVID-19

n = 36

All had N protein recognising T cells

Patients who recovered from SARS (One, 2003)

n = 23

Possess long-lasting memory T cells, reactive to the N protein of SARS-CoV

These have lasted for 17 years

These T cells displayed robust cross-reactivity to the N protein of SARS-CoV-2

We also detected SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in individuals with no history of SARS or COVID-19 (n = 37)

In some people with no previous SARS one or two, or exposure to contacts

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in uninfected donors exhibited a different pattern of immunodominance

Targeting different proteins on the N protein

These proteins are highly conserved in animal betacoronaviruses

But have low homology to ‘common cold’ human-associated coronaviruses

So

Infection with betacoronaviruses induces multi-specific and long-lasting T cell immunity against the structural N protein

Oxford, AstraZeneca, AZD1222

30 million doses under UK manufacture

Roll-out first half of 2021

Some people vaccinated 2020

Immune response similar across all age groups

Strong immune response in elderly

Encouraging to see immunogenicity responses were similar between older and younger adults (AZ)

Lower levels of side-effects in older adults

Elderly usually have a reduced immune response (e.g. influenza vaccine)

Differing methods of data gathering reveal vastly different infection rates in the UK, what is the evidence from both methods and what is the reality? This video argues for the accuracy of the data from the covid symptom tracker app as it is more consistent with the Office for National Statistics Data.

Infections rising rapidly in England

Swab tests, n = 85,971, England

Imperial College London and Ipsos MORI

Round 2, 16th to 25th October, prevalence, 1.28% of population infected

Out of self-administered 85,971 swabs, 863 were positive

Estimated 128 people per 10,000

Corresponds to 96,000 new infections each day

Round 1, 18th September to 5th October, it was 60 per 100,000

Infections increased

All age groups

Prevalence, areas of the country

The Humber,   2.7%, 1 in 40, (up from 0.84%)

North West,   2.3%

North East,   1.2%

West Midlands,  1.6%

East Midlands,   1.2%

South East,   0.55%

East of England,  0.64%

South West,   0.72%

London,    0.89%

Age and prevalence

Aged 18-24, 2.2%

Steepest rise, aged 55-64, x 3, 0.37% up to 1.2%

Over 65s, 0.81% x 2, 0.35% up to 0.81

Prevalence also doubled in primary and secondary school children

Reproduction number (R) = 1.56 (on an upward trend)

Giving a doubling time of doubling every 9 days

Previously, 29 days

Prevalence remained highest in 18 to 24-year olds at 2.25% (1.47%, 3.42%).

Official testing based new cases

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases

Cases, + 24,701 + 23,065

Cases, + 43, 596

Active, 556, 901

However,

Kings College / Zoe

R about 1.1

Doubling every 28 days

Increasing national rates that are steady

Not out of control as you might have heard from some other sources

Look at all the date, not one survey

More than a million reports per day

Swab test when sick

About 8% positive

Similar to ONS survey

The largest current data source

North of England, some suggestions the rates are coming down, but still higher than the South of England

Scotland and Wales somewhere in between

Mainly in young people

Large number of cases

Nor seeing overall excess deaths

COVID is the 15th cause of death nationally

40,000 people die in any Normal November

Risks for most people are still low

## Interview on UK
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSzq39X5bK8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSzq39X5bK8)

Interview on the latest UK numbers on LBC. The point is that the rate of increase is decreasing, if we carry on decreasing the rate of increase, soon we will have no increase in new cases. When there is no increase R will be zero. After this R will fall below 1 and so the new cases will reduce. BUT, we must continue the current measures to continue the reduction in the rate of increase.

As cases have increased in overall numbers, hospitalisations and deaths will inevitably follow. People dying today contracted the infection a month ago. This means deaths will continue to increase, but should reach a peak in late November, then start to drop. This is as long as the rate of increasing cases continues to decrease.

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/cases

https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8885157/Britain-records-367-Covid-19-deaths-darkest-day-end-May.html

Cases, + 22,885 = 917,575

Cases, + 43,936

Current infections, 541,802

Current new cases, much less than March, 100,000 – 200,000 per day

October 20th to 27th cases increase of 7.3% on the week

October 9th to 16th cases up by 14%

September, doubling every 7 to 8 days

Increase halving every week

Increase hoped for next week, 3.5%

Week after that 1.75%

One month, hopefully no increase at all

Then R = less than 1

Hands, face, space, ventilation, vitamin D, less travel

Hospitalised, + 1, 152 = 9,199

Hospitalised, 12th April, 19, 849

Ventilator beds, = 852

Deaths, + 367 = 54,365

Deaths, up 50% on last week

Deaths, (certificated) + 761 (past week) = 58,925

Tests, + 261, 855 = 29, 994, 301
