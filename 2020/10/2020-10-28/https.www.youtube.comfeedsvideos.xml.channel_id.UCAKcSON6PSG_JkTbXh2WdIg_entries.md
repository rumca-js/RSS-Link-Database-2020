Watch three songs from that performance.

This Friday, Oct. 30, Eels will release "Earth to Dora," their thirteenth studio album. In recognition of that, here are two performances from the most recent time Eels visited our studio, which was in 2018. They treated us to a song from their new-at-the-time album, "The Deconstruction," as well as a track from their 1996 debut album, "Beautiful Freak." Of that latter tune, "My Beloved Monster," a lot of people may recognize it from "Shrek."
"It was my tune first," E clarified at the time. "Shrek took it off our first album."

0:00 "My Beloved Monster"
1:51 "Today Is The Day"
