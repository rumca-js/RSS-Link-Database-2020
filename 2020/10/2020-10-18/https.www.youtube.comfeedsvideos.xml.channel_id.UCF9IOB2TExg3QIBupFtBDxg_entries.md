Infection fatality rate of COVID-19 inferred from seroprevalence data (WHO / Stanford, 14th October)

https://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf

Estimate the infection fatality rate

From seroprevalence data 

61 studies (74 estimates)

Eight preliminary national estimates

Seroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.02% to 53.40%

Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63%

Overall IFR

Across 51 locations

Median COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.23%

Most locations probably have an infection fatality rate less than 0.20% 

In people less than 70 years

Infection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.31%

Medians of 0.05%. 

Factors in areas with low IFR

Younger population (excluding Japan)

Previous immunity from other coronaviruses

Genetic differences

Hygiene etiquette

Lower infectious load

Other unknown factors

Country  IFR  under 70

Argentina  0.13  0.09

Brazil  0.27  0.9

BC   0.59  0.08 

Denmark  0.27  0.04

France  0.3  0.03

Italy   1.2  0.22

Netherlands 0.68  0.09

NY   0.65  0.25

S Florida  0.25  0.08

Louisiana  0.3  0.1

Bay   0.12  0.03

Georgia  0.44  0.15

Missouri  0.2  0.05




Assessing the Age Specificity
of Infection Fatality Rates for COVID-19: Systematic Review, Meta-Analysis, and Public Policy Implications 
6th October

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v6

0.4% at age 55

1.4% at age 65

4.6% at age 75

15% at age 85

Exponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19

Differences in the age structure of the population explain about 90% of the geographical variation in IFR 

Consequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths 

Humoral Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 
in Iceland 

https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2026116?articleTools=true

Measured antibodies in 1,215 diagnosed with quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay

Measured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2

Measured antibodies in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed 

In diagnoses people

1,107 of the 1,215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive

Antibodies increased during 2 months after diagnosis

Remained on a plateau for the remainder of the study

In quarantined people

2.3% were seropositive

In people not known to have been exposed

0.3% tested antibody positive
Conclusions

We estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2

Infection was fatal in 0.3% overall

New knowledge about the Iceland epidemic

We also estimate that 56% of all infections in Iceland had been diagnosed with qPCR

14% of infections had occurred in quarantined persons who had not been tested with qPCR

30% of infections had occurred in persons not known to have been exposed

Conclusions

Antiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not decline within 4 months after diagnosis

Risk of death from infection was 0.3%

44% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Iceland were not diagnosed by qPCR.

UK
ONS (16th October)

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26

England, 2 to 8 October 2020, Cases

336,500 within the community infected

1 in 160 people

Highest in older teenagers and young adults

Cases, + 27,900 new cases per day

Estimated percentage of the population in England testing positive

England and Wales, Up to 2 October, Deaths

Deaths, 390, (4.1%) above average total deaths

Deaths 321 (3.2%) mentioned COVID-19

Deaths, 215 (2.2%) the week before

Infection control

https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandthesocialimpactsongreatbritain/latest

Among those who have met up with people from outside their household either outdoors or indoors:

Said they always or often maintained social distancing, 82%

Those who said they did so sometimes, not very often, or never, 17% 

This 17% has stayed much the same for the past 3 months

Self-reported face mask wearing while shopping, 99%

Observation of other shoppers, 87%

Anxiety levels

Very or somewhat worried, 74%

High anxiety levels, 33%

Ethnic background and death, England and Wales

Demographic, geographical, socio-economic characteristics, multi-generational households, occupational exposure

After adjustments for those factors:

Increased rates of death, Black African, Black Caribbean, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi

Higher risk health conditions such as diabetes or heart disease 

Did not have a significant effect in explaining ethnic group differences.

Black African x males 2.5 times higher than for those of White background, Black African females x 2.1

While there is very limited data (and none specific for COVID-19), the following “cocktail” may have a role in the prevention/mitigation of COVID-19 disease.

Hong Kong, August 24th 

Reinfections, + 23 by mid-October

Deaths, + 1

Netherlands, 89 year old woman

May have been more earlier cases

May continue to test positive for several months

Without being sick or infectious

Viral genetic makeup is different

Cannot be explained through in-vivo evolution.

Average interval, 73 days

Australia

Cases, + 12

Western Australia has now been Covid-19 community-spread free for over 6 months
 
Restrictions have been eased over months now, with almost no restrictions within the State

Pretty much no mask wearing, but still have hand disinfecting stations at the door of shops, and social distancing rules at shops, banks, etc. of 1.5m

The hard border controls are working well, with the strict hotel quarantine “14 day” period

Catching 1-2 handfuls of positive cases coming in from overseas and interstate weekly

Catching infected crews on bulk carrier ships coming into port, two recently from Manila
