Even with coronavirus out of the picture, Britain is the sick man, woman and child of Europe.</p><p>The headline findings from the report are clear. In 2019, <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930977-6\">life expectancy at birth in the UK</a> was 82.9 years for a woman and 79.2 years for a man (the average for both was 81.1 years). These numbers look good, especially when compared with historical figures. In 1950, for example, the average life expectancy at birth for a UK citizen was 68.9 years. The combined effects of economic growth, better education and an improved NHS have delivered an extra 12 years of life.
