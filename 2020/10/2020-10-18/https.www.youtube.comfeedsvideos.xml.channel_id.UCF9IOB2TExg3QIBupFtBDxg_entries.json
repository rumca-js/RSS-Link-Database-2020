from seroprevalence data (WHO / Stanford, 14th October)\n\nhttps://www.who.int/bulletin/online_first/BLT.20.265892.pdf\n\nEstimate the infection fatality rate\n\nFrom seroprevalence data \n\n61 studies (74 estimates)\n\nEight preliminary national estimates\n\nSeroprevalence estimates ranged from 0.02% to 53.40%\n\nInfection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 1.63%\n\nOverall IFR\n\nAcross 51 locations\n\nMedian COVID-19 infection fatality rate was 0.23%\n\nMost locations probably have an infection fatality rate less than 0.20% \n\nIn people less than 70 years\n\nInfection fatality rates ranged from 0.00% to 0.31%\n\nMedians of 0.05%. \n\nFactors in areas with low IFR\n\nYounger population (excluding Japan)\n\nPrevious immunity from other coronaviruses\n\nGenetic differences\n\nHygiene etiquette\n\nLower infectious load\n\nOther unknown factors\n\nCountry  IFR  under 70\n\nArgentina  0.13  0.09\n\nBrazil  0.27  0.9\n\nBC   0.59  0.08 \n\nDenmark  0.27  0.04\n\nFrance  0.3  0.03\n\nItaly   1.2  0.22\n\nNetherlands 0.68  0.09\n\nNY   0.65  0.25\n\nS Florida  0.25  0.08\n\nLouisiana  0.3  0.1\n\nBay   0.12  0.03\n\nGeorgia  0.44  0.15\n\nMissouri  0.2

October\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v6.full.pdf\n\nhttps://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.23.20160895v6\n\n0.4% at age 55\n\n1.4% at age 65\n\n4.6% at age 75\n\n15% at age 85\n\nExponential relationship between age and IFR for COVID-19\n\nDifferences in the age structure of the population explain about 90% of the geographical variation in IFR \n\nConsequently, public health measures to mitigate infections in older adults could substantially decrease total deaths \n\nHumoral Immune Response to SARS-CoV-2 \nin Iceland \n\nhttps://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2026116?articleTools=true\n\nMeasured antibodies in 1,215 diagnosed with quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction (qPCR) assay\n\nMeasured antibodies in 4222 quarantined persons who had been exposed to SARS-CoV-2\n\nMeasured antibodies in 23,452 persons not known to have been exposed \n\nIn diagnoses people\n\n1,107 of the 1,215 who were tested (91.1%) were seropositive\n\nAntibodies increased during 2 months after diagnosis\n\nRemained on a plateau for the remainder of the study\n\nIn quarantined people\n\n2.3% were seropositive\n\nIn people not known to have been exposed\n\n0.3% tested antibody positive\nConclusions\n\nWe estimate that 0.9% of Icelanders were infected with SARS-CoV-2\n\nInfection was fatal in 0.3% overall\n\nNew knowledge about the Iceland epidemic\n\nWe also estimate that 56% of all infections in Iceland had been diagnosed with qPCR\n\n14% of infections had occurred in quarantined persons who had not been tested with qPCR\n\n30% of infections had occurred in persons not known to have been exposed\n\nConclusions\n\nAntiviral antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 did not decline within 4 months after diagnosis\n\nRisk of death from infection was 0.3%\n\n44% of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 in Iceland were not diagnosed by qPCR.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofGMSH5tjYk",
