Sometimes those games are good and sometimes they\u2019re bad, but they\u2019re always remembered as the games that launched alongside said system. With the PlayStation 5 quite literally around the corner we thought now would be a good time to look back at all the PlayStation launches starting with the first PlayStation in 1994 (1995 in America).\n\nThe first PlayStation  began with titles like the original Rayman, a Crystal Dynamics game known as Total Eclipse Turbo, and Ridge Racer (you\u2019ll be seeing plenty of that franchise in this video). The PlayStation 2 had some Rockstar games, a bunch of ESPN titles, and a FromSoftware game about a ring--if you can believe it. The PlayStation 3, meanwhile, had Call of Duty, Madden, NBA, and NFL--all those sports games you love. Finally, the PlayStation 4 had Assassin\u2019s Creed, and Knack, but unfortunately no Ridge Racer. Of course, there's a bunch of games alongside those, so tune in to see all those games too. \n\nThe PlayStation 5 will launch on November 12 in some regions and November 19 in others, with titles like Demon Souls, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Sackboy: A Big Adventure available at launch.\n\nGeneration Next: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg6WLs8kxGN-1ak9k2kTNBK7vJy1yjuR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O10sr1q7If0", "date_published": "2020-10-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
