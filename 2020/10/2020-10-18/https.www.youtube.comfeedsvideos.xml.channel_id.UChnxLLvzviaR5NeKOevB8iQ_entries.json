Hainbach and I build upon each other's performances and talk about the process!  In my first pass, I used Pamela's New Workout for sequencing, Erica Sample Drum for samples, and Mimeophone for effects. In my second I used the Hydrasynth and the Sleepy Circuit Hypno.\n\nPoem comes from here: https://archive.org/details/the_sea_2004.poem_librivox/\n\nThe basic ideas came from Podular Modcast (words as creative patch challenge) and a 2011 thread on the muffwiggler (yeah that name did not age well) forum called \"3 module challenge\". The excellent Modular Podcast (this is getting confusing right?) made it a big thing later on. We combine them and add our own collaborative spin to it. \n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEMnRgszgzk", "date_published": "2020-10-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
