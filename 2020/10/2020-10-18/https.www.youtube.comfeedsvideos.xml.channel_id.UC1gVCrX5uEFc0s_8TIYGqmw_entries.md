Irrigated Irrigator film by Lumiere Brothers.

A kid comes and rests his foot on the hose with which a gardener waters his garden. The latter, surprised to see the jet stop, examines the lance; at this moment the kid lifts his foot; the jet starts again and the sprinkler receives it in the face; furious, he runs after the kid and gives him a correction.
