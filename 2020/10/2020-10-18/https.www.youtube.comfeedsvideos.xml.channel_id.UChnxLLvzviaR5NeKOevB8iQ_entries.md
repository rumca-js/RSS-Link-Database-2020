3 words, 3 modules, 3 passes. Hainbach and I build upon each other's performances and talk about the process!  In my first pass, I used Pamela's New Workout for sequencing, Erica Sample Drum for samples, and Mimeophone for effects. In my second I used the Hydrasynth and the Sleepy Circuit Hypno.

Poem comes from here: https://archive.org/details/the_sea_2004.poem_librivox/

The basic ideas came from Podular Modcast (words as creative patch challenge) and a 2011 thread on the muffwiggler (yeah that name did not age well) forum called "3 module challenge". The excellent Modular Podcast (this is getting confusing right?) made it a big thing later on. We combine them and add our own collaborative spin to it.
