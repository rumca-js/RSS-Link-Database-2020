<p>Tottenham’s remarkable 3-3 draw with West Ham from 3-0 up showed the potency of the Son-Kane partnership Gareth Bale can complement but also what can go awry </p><p>The scriptwriters can hardly say they did not try. When Gareth Bale weaved in, out and past Angelo Ogbonna with two minutes left of added time, the juiciest of cherries looked ripe for garnishing a Tottenham performance that had lurched from scintillating to skittish. Through he ran, rolling back the years in so doing, and it was the kind of self-made chance he has made a career of gobbling up. Lukasz Fabianski stood still; the romantics held their breaths; the ball went past the post and, well, it was probably not going to matter all that much.</p><p>Moments later <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/18/tottenham-west-ham-premier-league-match-report" title="">Manuel Lanzini’s thunderbolt</a> ascribed it rather more significance.

<p>After a fall, my mother went to stay in a care home, and she was lonely at first. Then she discovered three years’ of text messages between me and my sister<br /></p><p>If you could call anywhere the canary in the coalmine of incompetence and chaos, it would be care homes. At the start of the coronavirus crisis, it was the UK health secretary, Matt Hancock, and his “protective ring”, which, in reality, meant insufficient testing, inadequate PPE and mass do-not-resuscitate orders because, come on, if you don’t try to save people’s lives, who can truthfully say you failed? By mid-June, care homes were the high-water mark of the tragedy, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/more-than-16000-people-in-uk-care-homes-have-died-from-coronavirus">more than 16,000 dead</a> in that one setting. Recently, the appalling cost of mismanagement on a human level has been apparent in these homes: patients with dementia losing the will to live without family visits, a government unable to muster a response to Covid and also blinded by it, apparently devoid of feeling for anyone with anything other than coronavirus.</p><p>In the midst of it all, my mother ended up in a care home, following an event that we would normally call falling over but, for reasons of endemic ageism (in my view), we now call “having a fall”. The two days she spent in hospital were worse in terms of visiting, since not only could my sister and I not see her, but we could feel the hot anxiety of the nursing staff as we hovered outside the door trying to pass her a power bank for her phone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/18/i-lent-my-mother-my-old-phone-now-shes-read-my-text-messages-and-discovered-untold-secrets">Continue reading...</a>

In 2019, <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930977-6">life expectancy at birth in the UK</a> was 82.9 years for a woman and 79.2 years for a man (the average for both was 81.1 years). These numbers look good, especially when compared with historical figures. In 1950, for example, the average life expectancy at birth for a UK citizen was 68.9 years. The combined effects of economic growth, better education and an improved NHS have delivered an extra 12 years of life.

## Why there is hope that the world's coral reefs can be saved

<p>From coral farming to 3D printing, scientists are using novel methods to save a vital part of our ecosystem</p><p>For most of us, the colourful, otherworldly marinescapes of coral reefs are as remote as the alien landscapes of the moon. We rarely, if ever, experience these underwater wonderlands for ourselves – we are, after all, air-breathing, terrestrial creatures mostly cocooned in cities. It is easy, therefore, not to notice the perilous state they’re in: <a href="https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/our_focus/oceans_practice/coasts/coral_reefs/">we’ve lost 50% of</a> coral reefs in the past 20 years; more than 90% are expected to die by 2050 according to a presentation at the Ocean Sciences Meeting in San Diego, California earlier this year. As the oceans heat further and turn more acidic, owing to rising carbon dioxide emissions, coral reefs are tipped to become the world’s first ecosystems to become extinct because of us.</p><p>Just because we don’t see them doesn’t mean we won’t miss them. For, as we are belatedly discovering, the nice, dry human world that we’ve made for ourselves is dependent on the planet’s natural systems and coral reefs are no exception. They protect our coastlands from erosion, they are the nurseries for the fish we eat and they harbour the plankton that produce the oxygen we breathe. Globally, coral reefs support a quarter of all marine life and the livelihoods of a billion people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/17/why-there-is-hope-that-the-worlds-coral-reefs-can-be-saved">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Strictly is back, and its hosts are loved by millions. Now it’s time for more women – of all ages – to be given primetime roles</p><p>Never has a spangle and sequin-loving British audience been so in need of both. On Saturday night television viewers were reunited with their lavishly staged, primetime love: <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>. It is the dance competition that changed the face of popular entertainment 16 years ago by apparently turning back the clock. And, along the way, it has picked up viewing figures that also frequently resemble something from the BBC’s glorious past.</p><p>Yet these days the ringmasters of this retro-circus are a very modern and slightly unexpected duo: Claudia Winkleman and Tess Daly. Winkleman, 48, is an arch-metropolitan, self-deprecatingly witty, while Daly, 51, glossily professional and warm, is the salt of the earth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/18/claudia-and-tess-a-dream-team-to-lead-us-through-a-long-dark-winter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic supercharges the atmosphere in this film version of Ian Rickson’s recent stage production</p><p>Here is an extraordinary, transfiguring leap from stage to screen. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/02/uncle-vanya-ian-rickson-toby-jones-review-night-of-living-dead-remix-faustus-that-damned-woman">Ian Rickson’s production of </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/02/uncle-vanya-ian-rickson-toby-jones-review-night-of-living-dead-remix-faustus-that-damned-woman">Uncle Vanya</a></em> was cut short by lockdown in the final weeks of its run. Now, in collaboration with director Ross MacGibbon, he has not merely captured his original staging but dazzlingly reinterpreted it. This is not, like the NTLive broadcasts, an attempt to transmit a theatrical event. It is a new thing. The film crackles with fresh intensity – and gains new shadows from the timing of its release.</p><p>Chekhov’s 1899 play is prefaced by shots of the cast arriving – dungarees and masks – at the Harold Pinter theatre for the first time since March: shaking out umbrellas, walking into an empty auditorium. As the action begins, something extraordinary happens. We are transplanted in time and place – there is nothing 21st-century British about Rae Smith’s lofty, crumbling design, the sodden glimmer of Bruno Poet’s lighting or old Nana with her long dark dress and bun, patiently waiting on everyone. Yet the stage is charged with the climate of Covid-19. That combination of sluggishness and highly tuned irritability, the feeling of time mysteriously slipping by, maliciously cheating people of their lives, is everywhere: in Toby Jones’s crosspatch, crumpled Vanya and Rosalind Eleazar’s Yelena, so heavy with disappointment she is scarcely able to move. The lassitude of Chekhov’s characters is sometimes spoken of as if it were a mental elegance: here, it is plainly toxic; everyone might be hung over after a too-long afternoon nap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/18/uncle-vanya-review-coronavirus-gives-chekhov-a-shot-in-the-arm">Continue reading...</a>

## Don DeLillo: 'I wondered what would happen if power failed everywhere'

<p>The US novelist, long preoccupied by the uneasy reality of western society, talks about his latest book, set in a world hit by a tech blackout</p><p>Over the course of 17 novels, Don DeLillo’s fans have come to feel that he is able to tune into vibrations far beyond the perceptions of other writers – and thus that his unnerving prescience is all part of the very spooky deal. But even by his standards, the timing of his new book, <em>The Silence</em>, is extraordinary. He finished writing it in March, just as New York, the city where he was born and still lives, went into lockdown – at which point fact and fiction fell, with unseemly haste, into a disconcertingly tight embrace. <em>S</em>et in 2022, it depicts a world in which the memory of “the virus, the plague, the march through airport terminals, the face masks, the city streets emptied out” is still fresh – and thus one where people are half expecting the new “semi-darkness” that falls in its opening pages, the sidewalks once again silent, and the hospitals all full. This time, however, the cause is not a pandemic, but a dramatic “loss of power”. Is it, as one character theorises, the Chinese? Have they “initiated a selective internet apocalypse”? No one knows, largely because they have no means of knowing. The lines are dead. The screens are blank. The technology is bust. Even the conspiracy theorists are going to find their audience tricky to reach now.</p><p>So that we might talk about this unlikely achievement, it is arranged that DeLillo will ring my landline – that “sentimental relic” as he calls it in <em>The Silence</em>. Is the thought of hearing the disembodied voice of Don DeLillo in the middle of a pandemic reassuring, or is it terrifying? In the days running up to our conversation, I can’t quite decide about this. But when the call is finally made – I stand up to take it, and somehow never manage to sit back down – he does not sound at all like a portent of doom. “Oh, I don’t see it that way,” he says, gently, when I ask if we should read the novel as a warning, our dependence on technology having only grown in the age of Covid-19. “It’s just fiction that happens to be set in the future. I guess it all started with the idea of the Super Bowl.” Images have always been important to him, and with this book, it was the idea of a blank screen that lodged itself in his mind. “I wondered what would happen if power failed everywhere, nothing functioning … a universal blackout.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/18/don-delillo-i-wondered-what-would-happen-if-power-failed-everywhere">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The director on waiting 35 years to film the perfect gay love story, and how French cinema is coping with Covid</p><p>French writer-director François Ozon, 52, is famous for his prodigious output. He directed his first full-length feature, <em>Sitcom,</em> in 1998, and his 19th, <em>Summer of 85</em>, a love story about two teenage boys in a Normandy seaside town, is out in the UK this month. In between, his diverse output includes the musical <em>8 Women</em>, the retro comedy <em>Potiche</em>, the Ruth Rendell adaptation <em>The New Girlfriend</em> and last year’s <em>By the Grace of God</em>.</p><p><strong>What were you doing </strong><strong>in the summer of ’85?<br /></strong>What <em>was</em> I doing? I think I went to Spain with a friend – I can’t remember exactly, I’d have to ask my parents. The film was going to be called <em>Summer of 84</em>. I changed the title because of Robert Smith of the Cure. I absolutely wanted to use their song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scif2vfg1ug">In Between Days</a>, and he said, “Sorry, but that came out in 1985.” So I changed the title, and he let us have the song.

## Half-term breaks and hotel bookings slump as restrictions bite

<p>Hopes are fading that the school holidays might provide a much-needed boost for tourism businesses in the UK</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p>Jules Cuthbert is getting used to cancelling holidays. The 41-year old mother of two from Bristol abandoned plans for an October half term trip to Merthyr Tydfil when the south Wales town <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/21/covid-lockdowns-four-more-areas-wales-cases-rise">went into lockdown on 22 September</a>. It was the fifth UK holiday she has had to postpone since the start of the pandemic and it may not be the last. As coronavirus cases continue to rise, Cuthbert is unsure whether to go ahead with her half-term plan B - a few days in the South Downs. “I’m now rethinking whether we should travel at all because we live in a highly populous area with a large student population. I’m a hospital pharmacist so I am very mindful of the potential risks of moving from an area with a high number of cases to one with less.”</p><p>Cuthbert’s experience is far from unusual. While many British holidaymakers managed to escape to the countryside during July and August, recent measures to contain the spread of the virus have thrown autumn and winter holidays plans into disarray and dashed any hopes that the half term holiday might help tourism businesses recoup some of the losses suffered during the first lockdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/oct/18/half-term-breaks-and-hotel-bookings-slump-as-restrictions-bite">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s a long time since Granny O’Reilly died, but there are still new and unexpected ways to think about her sad loss</p><p>Yesterday was the 29th anniversary of my mother’s death and I’m not sure how I feel about it. Not about the death itself – I’ve been pretty consistent about considering it a bad thing – but, rather, how to compute the fact that it’s nearly three decades ago.</p><p>I should know how I feel by now. Not only does that period comprise 95% of my conscious time on Earth, I’ve spent most of two years writing a memoir that goes into this childhood loss in some detail. No greater sign of how oblivious I was at that time is that the book’s title, <em>Did Ye Hear Mammy Died?</em>, is the phrase with which I cheerfully greeted mourners at her wake, unsure what tone to strike.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/18/old-grief-over-the-loss-of-my-mother-gets-some-welcome-comic-relief">Continue reading...</a>

## How do pandemics end? In different ways, but it’s never quick and never neat | Mark Honigsbaum

Just like the Black Death, influenza and smallpox, Covid-19 will affect almost every aspect of our of lives – even after a vaccine turns up<p>On 7 September 1854, in the middle of a raging cholera epidemic, the physician John Snow approached the board of guardians of St James’s parish for permission to <a href="https://www.immunology.org/john-snows-pump-1854" title="">remove the handle</a> from a public water pump in Broad Street in London’s Soho. Snow observed that 61 victims of the cholera had recently drawn water from the pump and reasoned that contaminated water was the source of the epidemic. His request was granted and, even though it would take a further 30 years for the germ theory of cholera to become accepted, his action ended the epidemic.</p><p>As we adjust to another round of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/15/tier-2-lockdowns-england-latest-covid-restrictions-explained" title="">coronavirus restrictions</a>, it would be nice to think that Boris Johnson and Matt Hancock have a similar endpoint in sight for Covid-19. Unfortunately, history suggests that epidemics rarely have such neat endings as the 1854 cholera epidemic. Quite the opposite: as the social historian of medicine <a href="http://bostonreview.net/science-nature/jeremy-greene-dora-vargha-how-epidemics-end" title="">Charles Rosenberg</a> observed, most epidemics “drift towards closure”. It is 40 years since the identification of the <a href="https://www.hiv.gov/hiv-basics/overview/history/hiv-and-aids-timeline" title="">first Aids cases</a>, for instance, yet every year <a href="https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet" title="">1.7 million people</a> are infected with HIV. Indeed, in the absence of a vaccine, the <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hiv-aids" title="">World Health Organization</a> does not expect to call time on it before 2030.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/18/how-do-pandemics-end-in-different-ways-but-its-never-quick-and-never-neat">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘I’ve never had so much craic’: Gaelic games come to loyalist east Belfast

<p>Founded in May, and explicitly designed to be non-sectarian, a community club has already attracted 1,000 members</p><p>It’s 50 years since a Gaelic football team played in east Belfast, and some 400 years since the last known hurling match – St Colmcille’s football team closed as the Troubles descended on Northern Ireland, and there’s been no record of hurling since the Gaelic lord Conn O’Neill’s rule in the 16th century. Gaelic games, associated with the nationalist community, might seem like unlikely sports to back in the historically loyalist area.</p><p>Yet last week the East Belfast GAA (Gaelic Athletic Association) club finished its first season triumphant. The club was formed in May after a series of conversations between friends Dave McGreevy and Richard Maguire, trying to do something about their lockdown boredom. McGreevy, a keen player of “Gaelic”, as Gaelic football is known, had moved to east Belfast with his fiancee. “Richard and I grew up with Gaelic games; we’re at an age where we’re both thinking about kids, so you would want a local team.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/18/ive-never-had-so-much-craic-gaelic-games-come-to-loyalist-east-belfast">Continue reading...</a>

All right, we’re at a café table but, due to the aforementioned plague, the tables have been allowed to stretch into the main thoroughfare, which is half closed to traffic, and Mathews is explaining how the menopause closed down her own private thoroughfare. “I first realised when I was wearing my workout leggings and they weren’t new, but they were starting to chafe,” she says, before describing the laser part of her “vaginal rejuvenation” treatment.</p><p>At this point, a voice from the pavement calls out “Meg!” and I can’t help but spin around, just in case it’s Kate Moss shouting from 1997, but it is not Kate Moss, it’s a sweet old lady in a raincoat with a tiny dog. “You’re looking well, Meg,” she says, and they chat politely until Meg can get rid of her neighbour and return to the business of her collapsing genitalia.

A Joe Biden presidency – increasingly likely – and an EU unhampered by British reluctance to do anything bold to reform or even tax a monopolistic private sector are set to make common cause. They will act in sync to attack the now bewildering monopoly power of the hi-tech giants by tackling its foundation – the simultaneous owning of pivotal digital platforms and the unbridled provision of the services on them.</p><p>Together, they will go on to reclaim the operation of the internet and enlarge individual control of personal data. Moreover, Biden, if he fulfils his campaign pledges to challenge shareholder-value-driven US business, act on climate crisis and enlarge union rights, will Europeanise the US economy to make it more friendly to this reform agenda. It will be a sea change – with Britain a marginalised bystander.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/18/europe-and-america-are-taking-on-the-tech-giants-britain-needs-to-join-the-fight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the middle of another sleepless night, it’s sometimes hard to tell what’s what</p><p>When was 12, I’d go to batmitzvah classes every Friday after school, and the highlight was breaktime, when we would sit crosslegged on the carpet while a formidable lady called Suzanne told us that day’s plot of <em>Neighbours</em>. One day she entered the room with unusual solemnity. She said there had been a terrible bomb at Lassiters and everybody had died, and <em>Neighbours</em> had finished forever. She waited a minute or so before breezily admitting she’d missed the lunchtime showing and so had no idea what had happened, but the joke was lost on us, a gasping room of pubescent Jews for whom <em>Neighbours</em> was our true religion. My main memory of that day is the thought: I have missed something important, we have suffered great loss and time cannot go backwards. Anyway hi, I’m back from maternity leave, I trust nothing has changed?</p><p>No, no I jest, I jest! My sense of taste and smell may be compromised, but my sense of humour, never. Pandemic. There’s a pandemic on. Instead of the calm birth and relaxing maternity leave I had planned, littered with pretty cakes and galleries and bawdy chatter about tits, I left work as lockdown started, had a baby at its bitter height and was sent home the same day to wait for death or Ocado, whichever came first.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/18/eva-wiseman-how-my-new-babys-first-weeks-and-lockdown-blurred-together">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Five years after winning Bake Off, she’d love to just talk about baking and cookbooks. But then there’s diversity in TV, mental health, the pandemic…</p><p>Nadiya Hussain has never published a baking book. She has never fronted her own baking show before either, having had her life changed by appearing on the big one, the one which put her under the national spotlight as she transformed from a shy, uncertain home cook into a <em>Great British Bake Off </em>winner, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/12/bake-off-winner-nadiya-hussain-muslims-britain">the best-loved winner in the history of the series</a>. Now, after five years of fame, her career, which has encompassed books, documentaries, cooking shows, a memoir, an MBE, and much, much more, has come full circle, and she is ready to focus on baking again. Surely someone has tried to get a baking book out of her before this?</p><p>“It was <em>my</em> choice. I chose not to go straight into baking,” she says. She is in her conservatory at home in Milton Keynes, the week before her three children are due to go back to school. It doubles up as both her home office and the cats’ room; her son is drawing at the kitchen table. Ordinarily, she’d be out in the world, meeting people, and she misses it terribly. “I really miss people. I miss hugging people. Even a handshake would be nice right now. I always overrun on everything, because I’m talking about something else. Shoes, a flavour, it could be anything.” I’m not even wearing shoes, I tell her. “I mean, I put on a bra just for you today,” she grins.

<p>It makes no sense to judge the fate of ‘white working-class boys’, a confusing category</p><p>White, working-class boys fare badly at school. About that, almost everyone is agreed. More contested is the reason why. Last week, the first witnesses gave evidence to the commons select committee on education’s investigation into “<a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/work/237/left-behind-white-pupils-from-disadvantaged-backgrounds/publications/" title="">left behind white pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds</a>”. The hearing made headlines, largely because one of the witnesses; Kent University politics professor Matthew Goodwin suggested that much of the problem lay in the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/13/white-working-class-pupils-suffering-due-to-status-deficit-mps-told" title="">status deficit</a>” felt by white working-class communities.</p><p>Over the years, I have highlighted the problems facing working-class students. So I welcome any new focus on the problem. I cannot but be cynical, however, about the headlines and wary about the direction of the discussion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/18/being-white-wont-hold-boys-back-being-working-class-just-might">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Charlotte Mensah is the undisputed queen of black hairdressing, with clients including Zadie Smith and Michaela Coel. Here, she tells Funmi Fetto about ‘good hair’, pushing boundaries and the joy of her salon community</p><p>Would you like some cake?” I stare, slightly perplexed, at the sizeable sweet treat being presented to me at <a href="https://charlottemensah.com/hair-salon-london/" title="">Hair Lounge</a>. A few questions race through my head. To get through that mammoth piece, how long will I need to leave my mask off? At what point does that become illegal? After over-indulging pre, during and post lockdown, should I really be eating more cake? Overwhelmed by my thought process, I politely, reluctantly, declined. Being served homemade nutmeg cake at a hair salon might seem unusual but this is Charlotte Mensah’s salon. It has a reputation not simply as the place where storied clientele come to have their hair done, but as a place people come for community, conversation and, yes, cake. “I love to bake,” smiles the softly spoken Mensah on the afternoon we meet. “It’s something I got from my grandmother. She had a massive clay oven in her compound in Accra, in Ghana, where she would bake a lot of cakes and breads. She also knew how to do hair.”</p><p>To know Mensah is to know that the “doing hair” gene has most definitely been passed down. But to say Mensah does hair is akin to saying the pope does religion. In Afro hair circles, she is a legend. Her experience as a stylist spans three decades and countless awards, including winning British Afro Hairdresser of the Year three times. In 2017, she became the first black woman to be inducted into the British Hairdressing Hall of Fame.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/oct/18/charlotte-mensah-queen-of-black-hairdressing-interview-hair-became-a-form-of-healing">Continue reading...</a>

Since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the collapse of her marriage she had been dreaming of a new start in California, which she mostly knew from the soap opera <em>Santa Barbara</em>. Through an agency, she advertised to be a mail-order bride and, having chosen a new partner, Eli, from a stack of replies, left her home and got on a plane with her two children. Diana was seven years old.</p><p>Santa Barbara was not how Svetlana imagined it. And neither was Eli, who was waiting at Los Angeles airport with a bunch of flowers – 20 years older, and a hundred pounds heavier than in the photograph he had sent. They married anyway and lived together for eight years. Diana was asked to call Eli “Dad” and did not see her own father again until she was in her 20s.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/oct/18/the-big-picture-my-mum-was-a-mail-order-bride">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mixing money with friendship is a bad idea, says Mariella Frostrup. It sows resentment and poisons relationships</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>I made the classic mistake of mixing friendship and money which, of course, turned out to be disastrous. Two years back I </em><em>ended up in a tight spot</em><em>. My best friend of 25 years offered me a loan that, in her words, I could pay back in my own time. </em><em>It was a sum that I’d have struggled to borrow, </em><em>but it would save my business. In return I felt obliged to offer her an interest in my business.</em></p><p><em>Before signing the contract, she </em><em>proposed partially merging our businesses, for which she</em><em>’d knock off part of the debt. I had </em><em>doubts, but it felt difficult to </em><em>deliberate the situation properly among the </em><em>chaos </em><em>in my life. When I was able to sit back and think, I decided to renegotiate. It ended in </em><em>disaster. She gave me an ultimatum: go along with her plan or pay </em><em>the whole sum back in a few months’ time. If not, there would be lawyers involved.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/18/i-borrowed-money-from-a-friend-but-the-terms-were-unfair-mariella-frostrup">Continue reading...</a>
