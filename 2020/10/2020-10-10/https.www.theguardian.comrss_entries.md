## Southgate plays down Gascoigne comparisons amid Grealish hype | David Hytner

<p>Manager remains realistic when bestowing praise on England’s new arrival, who is unlikely to start against Belgium</p><p>To Gareth Southgate, the comparison is, frankly, ludicrous. Managers tend to get annoyed when their players are likened to the greats of yesteryear or, at least, they try to downplay them and Southgate spoke with typical honesty about why Jack Grealish, who has man-of-the-moment status after a few excellent performances, ought not to be mentioned in the same breath as Paul Gascoigne. The talking point has floated around a little of late.</p><p>“I don’t want to be dampening the enthusiasm for Jack,” the England manager said. “When you’re talking about Gascoigne, there is not a player in English history who was at that level. I just feel that Gascoigne is so unique. It’s a bit like talking about Bobby Moore.” It is impossible to argue with Southgate about Gascoigne and he was also at pains to highlight Grealish’s qualities, namely the “fabulous ability to receive under pressure, to protect the ball, to dribble past people at a slightly different speed to some of our other players, the way he moves and draws fouls”. They were in evidence during the midfielder’s performance in Thursday night’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/08/england-wales-international-friendly-match-report">3-0 friendly win over Wales.</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/10/southgate-plays-down-gascoigne-comparisons-amid-grealish-hype">Continue reading...</a>

<p>More than 12,000 pages of US government documents show military operations contaminating the Pacific with radioactive waste, nerve agents, and chemical weapons like Agent Orange</p><p>In 1968, Leroy Foster was a master sergeant in the US Air Force, assigned to the Anderson Air Force Base in Guam, a United States island territory in the Pacific. The day after he arrived on the island, he recalled being ordered to mix “diesel fuel with Agent Orange”, then spraying “it by truck all over the base to kill the jungle overgrowth”.</p><p>Soon after, Foster suffered serious skin complaints and eventually fell sick with Parkinson’s and ischemic heart disease. Later, his daughter had cancer as a teenager, and his grandchild was born with 12 fingers, 12 toes, and a heart murmur. Foster died in 2018.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/poisoning-the-pacific-new-book-details-us-military-contamination-of-islands-and-ocean">Continue reading...</a>

His novels include the Booker-longlisted <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/19/the-wall-john-lanchester-review">The Wall</a></em> (2019) and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/04/capital-john-lanchester-review">Capital</a></em> (2012), while his nonfiction analysis of the credit crisis, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/07/whoops-john-lanchester-review">Whoops!</a> </em>(2010), was a bestseller. Lanchester was born in Hamburg, brought up in Hong Kong and lives in London. <em>Reality</em> is his first collection of stories, each of which takes the reader on an unsettling journey from the seemingly familiar to the eerily uncanny.</p><p><strong>Why did you decide to publish these stories, several of which have appeared in print elsewhere, now?<br /></strong>The “Why?” really was that I wrote the first one and read it to friends at the new year and someone said you should send it out. I sent it to the <em>New Yorker</em> and they published it [in April 2017]. It was the first short story I’d ever written. There’s not many things in your mid-50s that give you a tremendous buzz of validation, but that did.

<p>The House of Representatives’ report is a timely attack on Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google</p><p>On Tuesday evening, a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/06/technology/house-antitrust-report-big-tech.html">large (449-page) pdf</a> landed in my inbox. It’s the majority report of the US House of Representatives judiciary committee’s subcommittee on antitrust, commercial and administrative law and it makes ideal bedside reading material for only two classes of person: competition lawyers and newspaper columnists. But even if it’s unlikely to be a bestseller, its publication is still a landmark event because it marks the first concerted (and properly resourced) critical interrogation of a new group of unaccountable powers that is roaming loose in our democracies: tech companies. Its guiding spirit was something said by the great Supreme Court justice Louis Brandeis many moons ago: “We must make our choice. We may have democracy or we may have wealth concentrated in the hands of a few, but we cannot have both.”</p><p>Only four tech companies were targeted – Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. How Microsoft escaped scrutiny is a mystery (to me anyway); perhaps it’s because that company had its day in court long ago and survived to become the handmaiden of governments and organisations everywhere and is therefore part of the ruling establishment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/10/finally-us-politicians-are-taking-the-fight-to-the-tech-giants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fashion designer, 50, reflects on his multicultural background, why he finds fashion liberating and why he misses a full head of hair</p><p><strong>Transition defined</strong> my early years, whether it was the multiple languages spoken at home, my parents divorcing, or the constant travelling between London and Cyprus. Being from a multicultural background can be a blessing – it made me curious and open minded – but so often people who are end up confused and frustrated.</p><p><strong>I was raised</strong> by my mother and other women after my parents split. I was fascinated by the prospect of telling their stories through design; of using clothing as a tool for female empowerment. But the prospect of studying fashion seemed unattainable, and in a patriarchal [Turkish-Cypriot] society like ours it seemed impossible. Then, aged 16, I read in <em>Vogue</em> that Rifat Ozbek – a Turkish designer – had studied at Central Saint Martins. I thought to myself: why shouldn’t I, too?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/10/hussein-chalayan-gender-free-clothing-is-the-future">Continue reading...</a>

## Joana Choumali: 'I set my imagination free on the photographs'

<p>The prize-winning Ivorian photographer captures the energy of dawn in images shot in African cities then embroidered<br /></p><p>Joana Choumali’s interest in photography began when, as a child in Abidjan in Ivory Coast, her family hired a local studio photographer to take a family portrait. “I was fascinated by how he handled the camera and the lighting as well as the way he directed us,” she recalls. “It was almost like a ceremony. I remember asking him so many questions. That tacit communication and connection with other people through photography was what interested me the most. I wanted to do the same.”</p><p>Having studied graphic arts and then worked in an advertising agency in Morocco, Choumali rekindled her childhood fascination with photography in 2011, initially creating work that merged portraiture and documentary to explore “an Africa caught between tradition and modernity”. The images here, taken from her new series, <em><a href="https://joanachoumali.com/index.php/projects/mix-media/alba-hian">Alba’hian</a></em> (First Light of Morning), are among the highlights of the digital edition of <a href="https://www.artsy.net/show/gallery-1957-gallery-1957-at-photo-london-2020">Photo London</a>, which opened last week. They continue to explore that cultural dynamic but in a much more conceptual way, having been created by overlaying her digital photographs with meticulously hand-embroidered patterns of dazzling colour and intricate design.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/10/joana-choumali-i-set-my-imagination-free-on-the-photographs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The influencer industry is worth billions – but Instagram and YouTube content creators are often exploited. What happens when a personal brand joins a union?</p><p>Amy Hart earned her 1.2 million Instagram and 99,000 Twitter followers by appearing on 2019’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/love-island" title="">Love Island</a>, where she had her heart broken while wearing a denim minidress. Like many of the show’s former stars, she is now an influencer: she tells fans where to buy clothes, makeup, even teeth like hers. But on 12 May this year, Hart influenced her followers in an entirely different direction. “Join a union!” the 28-year-old <a href="https://twitter.com/amyhart1707/status/1260273166892572672?lang=en" title="">wrote on Twitter</a>, above a 14-second video. “We’re in a really uncertain time when it comes to work and your rights and legislation,” she said. “If I can give you one piece of advice: join a union. They were my absolute saving grace when I was employed by a big company.”</p><p>The video went viral, with more than 2,000 retweets and 10,000 likes. A former British Airways flight attendant, Hart says she was motivated by BA’s recent announcement of mass redundancies. Her video struck a chord with young people, who created supportive Karl Marx memes. “People were calling me a socialist icon,” Hart laughs. (She now uses the phrase as her nickname on WhatsApp.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/oct/10/influencers-are-being-taken-advantage-of-the-social-media-stars-turning-to-unions">Continue reading...</a>

By <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kathryn-bromwich">Kathryn Bromwich</a></p><p>If you’ve spent much time on the internet over the past decade, chances are you’ve seen some cats on there. Cats chasing their own tails. Cats attempting ill-judged jumps from one piece of furniture to another. Or, in the case of Gerrard Gethings, a cat who looked exactly like the actor David Schwimmer. “There’s something about the shape of Schwimmer’s face that’s quite interesting,” says the London-based photographer, “and the cat had exactly the same face. That pushed me over the edge, into thinking there was something in it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/10/purrfect-match-cats-and-their-human-doubles">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In our performative age, we’re rewarded for sharing every crisis that happens in our bodies, every thought that passes through our heads</p><p>A celebrity story broke last week that gave me, as my fellow young people would say, all the feels. But they were not good feels. In fact, they were pretty much every feel except the good kind: sad for the celebrity, bad about myself, uncertain about the world today.</p><p>This story was about Chrissy Teigen, a model and the wife of the singer John Legend, although neither of those descriptors really explains her popularity. Rather, that is down to what is frequently described as her “relatability”, or her willingness to share her personal life with the world. This, according to current thinking, makes this extremely beautiful and wealthy woman more real to the public. Over several days, she posted <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" title="">videos of herself on Twitter</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/chrissyteigen/status/1310422324366045184?s=20" title="">Instagram</a>, talking about how she’d been having heavy bleeding while pregnant. <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/chrissy-teigen-blood-transfusion-hospital-a4558526.html" title="">“Chrissy Teigen shares updates from hospital bed as she prepares for second blood transfusion”</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/pregnant-chrissy-teigens-horror-scare-22762324" title="">“Pregnant Chrissy Teigen’s horror scare as she scrambled to hear baby’s heartbeat”</a> were just two of the newspaper headlines, as if it were totally normal that a woman’s intimate pregnancy issues should be international news.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/10/the-wall-between-whats-private-and-whats-not-is-dissolving-which-side-am-i-on">Continue reading...</a>

## Why the hidden world of fungi is essential to life on Earth | Merlin Sheldrake

<p>Fungi have long supported and enriched life on our planet. They must be protected as fiercely as animals and plants </p><p>As you read these words, fungi are changing the way that life happens, as they have done for more than a billion years. They are eating rock, making soil, digesting pollutants, nourishing and killing plants, surviving in space, inducing visions, producing food, making medicines, manipulating animal behaviour, and influencing the composition of the Earth’s atmosphere.</p><p>Fungi make up one of life’s kingdoms – as broad and busy a category as “animals” or “plants” – and provide a key to understanding our planet. Yet fungi have received only a small fraction of the attention they deserve. The best estimate suggests that there are between 2.2m and 3.8m species of fungi on the Earth<strong> </strong>– as many as 10 times the estimated number of plant species – meaning that, at most, <a href="https://www.asmscience.org/content/journal/microbiolspec/10.1128/microbiolspec.FUNK-0052-2016">a mere 8% of all fungal species have been described</a>. Of these, only 358 have had their conservation priority assessed on the IUCN <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">red </a><a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">list of </a><a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">threatened </a><a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/">species</a>, compared with 76,000 species of animal and 44,000 species of plant. Fungi, in other words, represent <a href="https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ppp3.10146">a meagre 0.2% of our global conservation priorities</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/10/hidden-world-fungi-life-earth">Continue reading...</a>

Yet only two years ago, her teachers say, Amy was a “challenging tearaway” doing all the things that in many schools would lead to permanent exclusion.</p><p>But Amy’s school, <a href="https://www.georgegreens.com/">George Green’s in Tower Hamlets</a>, didn’t exclude her. Its leadership team, determined to bring down exclusions rates, committed themselves to keeping her in school. She has benefited from a radically different approach to managing behaviour, based on understanding pupils’ personal circumstances and helping them to overcome the impact of traumatic experiences in early life, or outside school, that may be affecting their behaviour – such as abuse, neglect, domestic violence and family breakdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/10/is-the-tide-turning-against-zero-tolerance-in-uk-schools">Continue reading...</a>
