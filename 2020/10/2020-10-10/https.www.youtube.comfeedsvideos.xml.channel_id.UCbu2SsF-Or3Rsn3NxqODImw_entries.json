Imagine you could see what they see, touch what they touch, and feel what they feel, all from the comfort of your own home In Cyberpunk 2077 this kind of tech exists, and it\u2019s called Braindance.\n\nIn this video, Jake Dekker looks back on the history of one of Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s most popular forms of entertainment, Braindance. Although Braindance shares some minor similarities with VR headsets, the technology couldn\u2019t be more different. Unlike virtual reality, BD can engage all five senses by stimulating your brain in a variety of ways. This results in a fully immersive experience that lets you live out scripted moments as someone else. While the most obvious use for this tech is *cough* porn, it was originally used to rehabilitate convicted criminals. But like all revolutionary technology, it became a crucial part of culture and its uses extended far beyond just those two things.\n\nFor more Cyberpunk Lore, be sure to check out our other videos, including our deep-dive on Adam Smasher, the cyborg who almost killed Johnny Silverhand.

Sony has said that about 99% of the over 4000 games available on PS4 will be playable on PS5. But, of course, that raises questions. Like, how will saves work across generations? And will PS4 games look the same on PS5?\n\nIn the video above, Lucy James walks through the most burning questions that relate to PS5 backwards compatibility. She focuses on talking about PS5's \"Game Boost,\" remote play, digital vs. physical, how different it will be to play certain games with a PS5 DualSense as opposed to a PS4 DualShock 4, PSVR, and save transfers. \n\nThere's the big question too: Given that the PS5 will only support 99% of the PS4 library, what 1% of games won't be able to be played on next-gen? The list of unsupported titles currently includes Robinson: The Journey and Hitman Go: Definitive Edition. Sony will maintain and constantly update a page of all the games that don't make the cut, though it shouldn't be too long when all is said and done. \n\nSony jumps into next-gen just two days after Microsoft, with PlayStation 5 scheduled to release on November 12. The next-gen console will launch with both a standard version and a cheaper all-digital edition, which may save you a bit of cash up-front but could cost you in the long-run. Weeks away from the console's release, the PS5 launch line-up is beginning to take shape, and includes The Pathless and the Demon's Souls remake, among others.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6Qmm8HEuLc", "date_published": "2020-10-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5: What Is Sony Doing? | Generation Next", "description": "On this week's Generation Next, the gang dissect the latest PS5 news, as well as discuss how strange it is that there's so much about the console we don't know yet. \n\nThings have been a little quiet on the PlayStation 5 front lately, but Sony has started drip-feeding us small amounts of information. Of course, it's not enough to quench our thirst, but at this point, we'll take whatever we can get. The relatively reserved approach Sony has taken on delivering details has us wondering what its strategy is, and that's exactly what the subject of this episode of Generation Next is about.\n\nLucy, Jordan, and Tamoor talk through Sony's decision to stay tight-lipped about all things PS5 and what it means for people that are currently thinking about making new console purchasing decisions. They also reflect on how this strategy impacts Microsoft, as it also gears up to launch the Xbox Series X/S in the same period. \n\nFrom there, the team hits all the information that Sony has provided in the last week. This includes small details on how the DualSense controller identifies different players, how much hard drive space is allegedly taken up by the OS, and the decision to swap the function of two buttons around in Japan.\n\nOn top of that, there's a discussion about the Tempest 3D Audio Engine (which won't work at full capacity when the console launches), the official PS5 teardown video, and the recent Trophy changes, among other things. \n\nGeneration Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ram\u00e9e, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:55 - Thoughts on Sony's PS5 Pre-Release Strategy Compared to Xbox\n05:44 - Japanese Hands-On Details - DualSense Lights, Load Times, and Fan Noises\n08:19 - Alleged Storage Space\n09:58 - X and O Buttons Swapped In Japan\n12:02 - Tempest 3D AudioTech Staggered Launch\n13:36 - Trophy Level Changes\n15:41 - Trophy Tracking Is Finally Coming?\n16:38 - PS5 Teardown Video - Cooling Fan, Dust Catchers, Removeable Base, etc.\n22:04 - Stuff We Still Don't Know - Create Button, UI, etc.\n25:43 - Outro\n\nJapanese coverage translated: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w0BAcZrpcs&feature=youtu.be \nChris Pereira's 'Hey Sony, How Exactly Does PS5 Work?' article: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hey-sony-how-exactly-does-ps5-work/1100-6483049/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaLd5vBlbig", "date_published": "2020-10-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "RazerCon 2020 Livestream", "description": "Tune into RazerCon 2020 to learn about all new Razer hardware and updates on its products.
