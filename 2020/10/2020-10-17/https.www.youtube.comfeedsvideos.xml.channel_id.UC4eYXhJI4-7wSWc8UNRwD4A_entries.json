While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch Julian Lage Trio\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2011: https://www.npr.org/2011/07/07/137646119/julian-lage-trio-tiny-desk-concert\n\nPatrick Jarenwattananon | July 7, 2011\nYou hear a lot about young prodigies in jazz. That's understandable: Jazz prizes skill, and any teenager who can tear it up like the big boys and girls is usually worth a smile and nod. But usually, you can safely make a note to yourself to check in about that kid in, say, 10 years. It's one thing to emulate the masters' technique. It's another to develop an original style, the way your heroes did.\n\nGuitarist Julian Lage, 23, was once called a prodigy. He was a cute kid, true. But lately, he's also been playing in bands of master musicians \u2014 among them Gary Burton, Eric Harland and Mark O'Connor. There's also the matter of Lage's distinct sound. He plays an electric guitar, which sounds almost like an acoustic, and he tends toward folky, pastoral lines, but with a bite. When Lage released his debut album two years ago, even hardened jazz cynics took notice: He had ideas, too.\n\nWhen Lage recently came for a one-nighter in Washington, D.C., he brought only bassist Jorge Roeder and percussionist Tupac Mantilla. (His usual quintet is a bit unusual, adding a saxophonist and a cellist.) Collectively, the three are soft-spoken and friendly, and they're stellar musicians, too. At the NPR Music offices, they treated us to songs that haven't yet been commercially recorded \u2014 the opening tune \"Welcoming Committee\" and the closing untitled number, harvested from a little online experiment wherein Lage challenged himself to write a song a day for 30 days. (\"The first 23 suuucked,\" he joked.) In between, there's the gentle whisk and country-road twang of \"However,\" which appears on the Julian Lage Group's 2011 sophomore album, Gladwell.\n\nThe three looked intently at each other throughout this Tiny Desk Concert, with the sort of push-and-pull group interaction that brought a near-constant smile to each of their faces. There was plenty of concentration wrapped up in that, of course; before we started rolling tape, the three grabbed each other's hands in a circle for a brief moment of meditative clarity. But then they had some fun.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Welcoming Committee\"\n\"However\"\n\"Untitled (No. 24)\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXMRg2snp1g", "date_published": "2020-10-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Amplify with Lara Downes: Rhiannon Giddens", "description": "Lara Downes | October 17, 2020\n\nIn the 1920s, a renaissance happened in Harlem. Black artists migrated north, rejecting centuries of a tragic status quo. They inspired each other to make art that expressed an audacious new vision of Black beauty, Black hope, Black truth and Black pride. A century later, Black artists are coming together again, somehow, though not physically this time. \n\n\nWelcome to Amplify With Lara Downes, where you can eavesdrop on my intimate conversations with visionary Black musicians who share what they're making in this time of transformation \u2014 of reckoning, reimagining and maybe rebirth.\n\nWe're reaching out from our isolation in quarantine, inspiring each other to reject our own tired status quo, to dream the future, make something bold and meaningful of this time and in this time. \n\n\nOne day in July, I ventured out with my kids to march for Black lives at the state capitol here in California \u2014 people of all colors, chanting for change. Looking around me, I felt a jolt of something unfamiliar and realized it was hope. When we got home, I sat down at my piano, pressed \"record\" on a vintage cassette deck and played music by great Black artists who made music from the struggles of their time; spirituals, freedom songs \u2014 music by Florence Price and Nina Simone \u2014 single takes, unfiltered. On the mixtape you can hear the wind in the big elm tree outside my window. It's imperfect and I treasure it: the music I made on the day when I remembered hope.\n\n\nThe artists who are my guests on Amplify With Lara Downes have all had similar moments of awakening during this tragic and transformative year, when we saw our way to making \"good trouble.\" We took a stand and dared to express something as audacious as hope. \n\n\nJoin us here \u2014 and on YouTube \u2014 and we'll tell you about what we're making. This week, Rhiannon Giddens joins me from her kitchen table. Rhiannon is my friend and soul sister, my fellow traveler on the path that leads to the deep center of American music. We've both been trailblazing for a long time, excavating our own areas of the musical landscape, meeting each other here and there along the way. In this year of staying home and standing still, we reflect together on the long miles we've traveled so far and what we've found on our journeys, envisioning the wide open road ahead.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oVetwoLng8", "date_published": "2020-10-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
