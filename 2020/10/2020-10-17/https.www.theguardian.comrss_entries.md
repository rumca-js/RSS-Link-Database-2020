<p>From food banks to youth clubs, the C of E hosts 35,000 projects. Now a price has been put on its contribution</p><p>Sixteen years ago, St Stephen’s church in Bradford was on the verge of closure. Its congregation had dwindled to half a dozen, and the building – a “big old barn of a place”, in a predominantly Muslim area – was in poor repair. “People thought it had had its day,” said the Rev Jimmy Hinton.</p><p>Now, St Stephen’s is a vital hub, providing support and activities in an area of acute deprivation. The nave has been cleared of its pews, and heating has been installed. On a typical day, you might find an exercise class, a support group for asylum seekers and refugees, community meals being cooked and served, singing and stories for infants, mosaic-making, and people hunting for jobs or claiming benefits online.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/18/churches-tally-up-their-value-to-society-at-124bn">Continue reading...</a>

## Manchester City show Arsenal that the game belongs to the players | Jonathan Liew

<p>The match began as a battle of minds between Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta, but City looked more comfortable as things became more conventional in the closing stages<br /></p><p>For much of the night, the Etihad Stadium was thick with the fog of war. Games between managers who know each other well can often grind themselves into stalemate. There was never any realistic chance of that happening with Pep Guardiola and Mikel Arteta. Their two previous meetings as coaches had been contrasting, highly evolved affairs, and for an hour this was no different: a coaching duel that more closely resembled a heads-up poker game, an exercise in inscrutability.</p><p>And yet in the end, this was not really a game won and lost on plans or schemes. That much became manifest in the anticlimactic closing stages, as Manchester City imperiously closed down a game that had spent much of its life teetering on the brink of chaos. Ultimately, they won because they had better players who had been coached together for longer. Sometimes it really is that simple.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/17/manchester-city-show-arsenal-that-the-game-belongs-to-the-players">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jacinda Ardern has secured a second term as leader after a resounding victory in the country’s general election. The Labour leader had led a coalition government since October 2017, ending nearly a decade of National rule. During her first term Ardern had to deal with responses to the Christchurch terrorist atrocity, the Whakaari volcano eruption and the Covid-19 pandemic.

The artist is sitting at his drawing board, perched atop a mountain of dead bodies, as a succession of importunate reporters crowd in bombarding him with questions: “Okay... let’s talk about Israel...” “Could you tell your audience if drawing <em>Maus </em>was cathartic? Do you feel better now?”</p><p>As the questions come in, he struggles to answer – “A message? I dunno...” “Who am I to say?” – and over the course of the following panels shrinks to the size of a toddler, marooned in his writing chair. “I want... ABSOLUTION. No... No... I want... I want... my MOMMY! WAH!” The reporters vanish, and mini-Spiegelman confesses: “Sometimes I just don’t feel like a functioning adult.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/17/graphic-artist-art-spiegelman-on-maus-politics-and-drawing-badly">Continue reading...</a>

The compartmentalisation of land into private gardens is one of the causes of their disappearance from our landscape – they have declined by 90% since the second world war.

I found that everything in Uoma runs a shade darker than most brands, which is no hardship when factored in and shouldn’t be an obstacle in trying what is a superlative concealer. An opportune browse in Selfridges gave me a better look, so I went for Fair Lady T1 and I’m so thrilled with my purchase that I’ve just ordered a spare.</p><p>Stay Woke is creamier than most, and blends perfectly, brightening greyness noticeably, before staying exactly where you want it (no chasing around the face, waiting for it to sit still).

<p>These recipes, from Nigella’s new book Cook, Eat, Repeat, are ones she comes back to again and again</p><p>One of the questions that’s hardest to answer about a book is, “What are your favourite recipes from it?” I’m ruthless about the recipes I include: only those I love enough to cook, with undimmed enthusiasm, on repeat make the cut. But within that, of course, there are categories of fondness, and the dishes that follow are those to which I return with greedy glee whenever I want sumptuous comfort allied with flavour for a supper that bolsters quite as much as it soothes.

## From Warhol to Steve McQueen: a history of video art in 30 works

<p>Starting with experimental film in the 60s, video art has revolutionised the art world. We celebrate the medium through its most groundbreaking pieces</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/picture/2020/oct/17/modern-toss">Modern Toss on video art ...</a></li></ul><p>Video art emerged in tandem with experimental film during the 1960s, as lively, open-ended alternatives away from the centre. Practitioners with contrarian agendas and backgrounds in disparate fields – music, performance, literature, visual art and the moving image – took to experimenting with audiovisual configurations. Feeling unconstrained, they explored consumer tools alone in their studios, or in the supportive environment of artist-run, nonprofit spaces.</p><p>During this early phase, contemporary art museums concentrated on concrete, commodifiable forms, namely painting and sculpture. Many considered the moving image anathema, horrified by how sound would invade adjacent sacrosanct white-cube spaces. Yet by the late 1990s, museums were finally contemplating video and media as exhibitable art forms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/17/warhol-steve-mcqueen-a-history-of-video-art-barbara-london">Continue reading...</a>

## Streaming: the best films exploring black British lives

<p>The BFI and BBC lead the way in archive documentaries and dramas that have now become essential historical studies</p><p>One of the few good things to be said about this very bad year is that by the time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/11/black-history-month-events-that-should-be-taught-to-every-pupil">Black History Month</a> came around at the start of October, it didn’t feel like an isolated commemoration so much as a further prompt in an ongoing project. Since the global Black Lives Matter protests this summer, a fresh popular syllabus on black history, culture and anti-racism has begun to be constructed. Reading lists have been compiled by the dozen; viewing lists too, though as soon as you start to build one with a British focus, the enduring gaps and blind spots of a national cinema become soberingly apparent.</p><p>Black British history remains the most occasional concern of a film industry that churns out historical cinema by the bucketload. Steve McQueen’s <em>Small Axe</em> film series – telling five separate stories from London’s West Indian community between 1969 and 1982 – will offer viewers<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/oct/03/steve-mcqueen-our-marlon-brandos-are-on-building-sites-or-driving-buses"> a rare retrospective view </a>of black British society when the BBC airs it next month. But many of the most essential screen studies of black history in Britain are not period pieces, but contemporary films that have become history themselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/17/streaming-the-best-films-exploring-black-british-lives">Continue reading...</a>

Walsh was 17, a straight-A student who excelled at maths. She was also an aspiring model whose blond, blue-eyed, girl-next-door look had already got her noticed; at a local hairdressing event, a couple of stylists from a Paris salon had offered to send her headshots to a leading model agency, Paris Planning. Letters and phone calls had been exchanged, and Walsh was invited to Paris.</p><p>At the agency’s offices, Walsh and her mother, Ellen, were introduced to the charismatic 30-year-old boss, Gérald Marie. Marie offered to take them to lunch. “So we went to a little outdoor bistro in the Place de la Madeleine, around the corner from the agency,” says Walsh, speaking on the phone from her home in Los Angeles. “It was the first time I ever had a croque monsieur, and he was explaining what it was. I realise now it’s a fancy grilled cheese sandwich. And I remember distinctly him fawning over my mother, and this was surprising to me.

Drain explained how you can mix vegetable peelings, egg shells and persimmon skins, which are rich in lactic acid bacteria, into a base of rice, wheat or oat bran, or even cacao or coffee husks, to make a “<em>nukazuke</em> bed”, a traditional Japanese way of fermenting vegetables. Rice bran is a byproduct from processing and polishing rice, and contains many nutrients, as do wheat and oat bran, which are a great alternative for nukazuke made in Britain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/17/how-to-make-nukazuke-or-bran-fermented-vegetables-recipe-tom-hunt-no-waste">Continue reading...</a>

<p>So much as anyone can, the New York governor has had a good pandemic. His book trumpets successes – and settles scores</p><p>On Thursday, the US reported 65,000 new cases of Covid-19 and Donald Trump falsely told a television town hall 85% of people who wear masks contract the disease. With more than two weeks to the election and a <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-virus-outbreak-politics-voting-elections-efd6eefbd3d140bdc8909360de0bff62">record-shattering</a> 17 million Americans having already voted, the rhythms and tropes of the past seven months will only intensify between now and 3 November.</p><p>Early in the pandemic, Andrew Cuomo’s daily briefings emerged as must-see television, counter-programming to the campaign commercials that masqueraded as presidential press conferences.
