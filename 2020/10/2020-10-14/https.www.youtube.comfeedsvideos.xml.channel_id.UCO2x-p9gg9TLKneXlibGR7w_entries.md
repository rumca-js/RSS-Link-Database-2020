Apple announced the new iPhone 12 models on October 13, 2020 in a livestreamed Apple Event keynote. The new HomePod mini was announced along with the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. There's a lot to coverâ€”from 5G mmWave to the cameras, to the new design, to the new MagSafe charging and accessories (cases, magnetic wallets, car mounts, etc), and a whole lot more! Let's get into it in this iPhone 12 First Look.
