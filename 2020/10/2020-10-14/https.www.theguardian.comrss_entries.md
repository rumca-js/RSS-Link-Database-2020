<p>‘He wanted to get on a train in Tokyo to see what they were like. He put on a facemask and did a shiver as a joke. Because of Covid-19, it now seems really prescient’ </p><p>Blur toured Japan in 1992 and I went with them for NME. It was the first time we’d seen Japanese kids wearing facemasks. Damon was intrigued, so he bought one. Normally when you’re away with a band, you don’t get time to see anything of the cities you’re in – and a lot of bands aren’t that interested anyway. But Blur were keen to explore Tokyo. Damon wanted to get on a train and see what that was like. He looks like he’s shivering but I think it was a joke to fit with the face covering. Back then, it was really unusual to see a westerner wearing a mask. Because of Covid-19, the image seems really prescient now.</p><p>NME got a lot of letters about the shot. People didn’t understand what was going on. How dare someone show vulnerability? I thought it would make a really good cover, but NME always wanted the cover star to be instantly recognisable and make eye contact, so they ran it inside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/14/damon-albarn-facemask-covid-19-kevin-cummins-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian follows Parit Chiwarak, known as Penguin, one of Thailand's prominent protest leaders as he helps organise one of the biggest anti-government rallies in years.&nbsp;He and many other young people are risking prison to demand a significant democratic overhaul: they want the power and wealth of the monarchy curbed.

<p>Trump has repeatedly stated that he may refuse to accept defeat in the coming election. As Lawrence Douglas explains, things could get very messy if the result is close</p><p>In the run-up to the 2016 election, Donald Trump famously declared that he would accept the result of the contest with Hillary Clinton, before pausing for dramatic effect and adding: “If I win.” Even after being sworn in as president he cast doubt over the legitimacy of millions of votes that had seen him lose the popular vote while winning in the electoral college. </p><p>This time around, with millions more than usual expected to vote by mail and with him trailing badly in the polls, Trump is once again questioning the legitimacy of the voting system. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/14/us-election-2020-what-if-trump-refuses-to-concede-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
