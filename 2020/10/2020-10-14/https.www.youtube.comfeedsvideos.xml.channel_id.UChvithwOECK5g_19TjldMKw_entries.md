Yeonmi Park is a North Korean defector, who was sold in China, and managed to escape through the Gobi desert to Mongolia. From there, she ended up in South Korea, and then finally, in the USA, where she is now a human rights activist. I interviewed her about her experiences, predictions, and North Korea's relationship to China.
