This one has a CV expander, so we'll rock out some run stuff with the Noodlebox. Then we'll do a big honking ACID JAM at the end.\n\nGrab my new album: \nhttps://fanlink.to/rmrhindsight\nWatch the music video:\nhttps://youtu.be/xBYug1VT8a8\n\nhttps://www.moogmusic.com/products/werkstatt-01\n\n00:07 - Build\n06:14 - Sounds and Functions\n11:34 - ACID with the TR-6S, Noodlebox, and Poly Digit\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ac7-CwfNnqk", "date_published": "2020-10-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
