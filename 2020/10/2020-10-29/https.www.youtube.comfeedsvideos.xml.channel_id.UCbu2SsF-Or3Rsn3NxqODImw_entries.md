With 22 studios under its roof, Microsoft has a lot in the works for its Xbox Series consoles. To help keep track of it all, this video goes over every franchise Xbox Games Studios has cooking in the kitchen.

Host Kurt Indovina goes down the list of all 22 Xbox Game Studios companies, detailing what they've worked on and what they have coming up. 343 Industries, the Halo-focused studio, is of course working on Halo Infinite, but the Forza Horizon-centric studio, Playground Games, is developing an all-new Fable. Then there are other studios that have their fingers in many different pies, such as Obsidian. The Outer Worlds developer is working on several games at once, including Grounded and Avowed (hopefully a new Fallout: New Vegas, too). Or Ninja Theory, the developer of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice and Bleeding Edge, is working on Senua's Saga: Hellblade II and Project: Mara. 

There's plenty of newly formed studios like The Initiative, Microsoft's "AAAA" studio, that hasn't announced what it's working on yet. The new developer is made up of industry veterans from big studios such as Naughty Dog, Bungie, and Crystal Dynamics. Though there's no confirmation on what it's working on, there are rumors of it reviving the Perfect Dark franchise.

But what about MachineGames? Is it working on another Wolfenstein? Same with Roundhouse Studios--is it developing the next Prey? While there are some unanswered questions, this video will equip with you the knowledge of what studios are under the Xbox umbrella and an idea of what's on the way.

## Nvidia RTX 3070 - Is This The Card To Get?

After some time testing the Nvidia 3070, Dave Jewitt and Michael Higham talk about the strengths of this powerful mid-range GPU, and how it holds up against the bigger 3080, and last generation's 2080 TI

To accompany our review of the Nvidia RTX 3070, we had a discussion around our benchmark results, which situations it would make sense to upgrade to the card, and how availability can affect your decision. You can check out the full results of our benchmark in our written review, but to summarize it, the RTX 3070 essentially performs on par with the RTX 2080 Ti. That's impressive considering that the RTX 3070 goes for around $500 MSRP and that the 2080 Ti was last generation's enthusiast-level card that sold for over $1000.

If you're trying to get top-notch performance at 4K, the RTX 3080 is a better card but the 3070 can certainly hold its own at that resolution. At 1440p, the performance gap closes somewhat, especially when games start to become more CPU-bound--that's where the RTX 3070 really shines.

It can be difficult to actually find an RTX 3070 for sale, however. Nvidia has struggled to keep supply up to meet demand and said that things probably won't get easier until later in 2021. In light of the recent news from AMD about its Radeon RX 6000 series video cards, you might have more options when those cards launch later this year--and we touch on that topic a bit here.

Overall, if you're still on a GTX 10 series (or GTX 9 series) video card, and have been holding out for a more significant upgrade, the RTX 3070 is one of the best options for its price and performance. If you're using an RTX 2070 (or better), you won't get that big of a benefit unless you're really itching to get better FPS in your games. Ray tracing and DLSS are becoming increasingly common so these RTX cards are more appealing now, and the 3070 makes a strong case as the one to get.

We asked you for your burning questions about the PlayStation 5 and DualSense Controller, and we answer 'em in this week's Generation Next.

Things are really heating up as we transition to the new generation of consoles. We're just over a week away from both the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 being released. We've already done extensive coverage of the former, and now we have the opportunity to turn our attention to the latter.

We've got the PlayStation 5 and have already done a preview of its form factor, as well as an unboxing. We also put out the call for your questions and, in this episode of Generation Next, will be answering them. Of course, there are some restrictions as to what we can talk about at this stage, but there's plenty of good information in the episode nevertheless.

In the episode, we cover the PS5's stand and the best way to situate the hardware, early impressions of the DualSense controller, the PSVR camera adapter, and even how sweaty our hands get while playing, because at least one of you wanted to know about that. 

We've also stored some of your questions and will no doubt come back to them in future episodes when we can more confidently address them. Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.

Tamoor breaks down the biggest details about the upcoming Demon's Souls Remake from his interview with the Creative Director from SIE Worldwide Studios, Gavin Moore.

The Demon's Souls remake for PS5 is an exciting prospect for longtime fans and newcomers alike. It offers the chance to relive a beautiful new version of From Software's seminal Souls game or to check out the game that laid out the template for From Software's titles for the first time. 

But, naturally, there are a lot of questions surrounding the details of the remake effort. After all, it's being handled by Bluepoint Games, alongside Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios. Bluepoint Games is called the master of the remaster, having knocked it out of the park with Shadow of the Colossus and Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, among others. But a completely remade Souls game not involving From Software still makes fans nervous. 

Thankfully, I was able to talk to Gavin Moore, creative director at SIE Worldwide Studios External Development, and get some answers to a few of my big questions. Having done so, I feel a little more at ease about the game, especially having learned about some of the new features and tweaks. So, settle in, here's eight things you need to know about the remake.

Ubisoft has delayed Far Cry 6 and Rainbow Six Quarantine, CD Projekt Red boss comments on Cyberpunk's latest delay, and Todd Howard weighs in on whether or not he thinks The Elder Scrolls 6 will be an Xbox exclusive. 

Ubisoft has announced that it is delaying two of its biggest upcoming games: Far Cry 6 and Rainbow Six Quarantine. They will no longer release in the current fiscal year, instead launching between April 2021 and March 2022. The delays are due to complications related to the developers working from home. 

Cyberpunk 2077 was recently delayed to December 10, and CD Projekt Red's CEO Adam Kicinski has revealed why. On an investor call, he said that despite passing certification from Microsoft and Sony, the developer wasn't happy with how the game ran on PS4 and Xbox One. If you're itching for more Cyberpunk while you wait, we've got loads of lore videos for you to check out right now. 

Bethesda's Todd Howard finds it "hard to imagine" that the upcoming Elder Scrolls 6 would be an Xbox exclusive after Microsoft acquired ZeniMax Media last month. Bethesda will also continue to publish its own games, and Howard commented that their partnership seems to be based more around the benefits of Game Pass for developers.

Watch Dogs: Legion struggles with tone at times, but its empowering message about unity and justice still shines in a game that is as absurd as it is impactful.

Ubisoft's open-world action-adventure game Watch Dogs: Legion releases for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC and Google Stadia on October 29. It will be coming to Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 on November 10 and 12 respectively. You can read the full written Watch Dogs: Legion review by Alessandro Fillari on GameSpot.
