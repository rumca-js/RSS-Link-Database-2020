## From blockbuster films to wedding rings: why there’s no such thing as originality without tradition

<p>From your favourite film to the whisky you’re sipping, no matter how traditional something is, there is always a way to put an original spin on it, says Samantha Wood</p><p>It wasn’t long ago that my dear friends Alice Walkling and Oscar Wanless were due to have their first child. When talk arose of what the surname of their baby girl would be, they agreed it should reflect their new chapter, celebrate both of them equally – and also either side of the family that had gone before – all while giving a bit of a bop on the nose to the patriarchy. Smooshing names is all the rage, but “Walkless” didn’t feel right, and the other first-half-name mash-up (say it out loud), perhaps not so appropriate. So, they popped together the endings and, hey presto! They’re all now officially “the Lessings”.</p><p>When other friends of mine got married, they created a double-barrel with their grandmothers’ maiden names. When I was explaining these brilliant twists on something so traditional to my 78-year-old mother, she remarked: “How very <em>original</em>, darling.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/drink-outside-the-box/2020/oct/29/from-blockbuster-films-to-wedding-rings-why-theres-no-such-thing-as-originality-without-tradition">Continue reading...</a>

By all rights, as a film about David Bowie, Stardust should supersede them both. Who could possibly fail to get excited by a gorgeous, big-budget, fully authorised biopic of one of the most legendary rock stars of all time, packed with hit after hit after glorious hit?</p><p>The bad news is that Stardust isn’t that film. It isn’t authorised in the slightest – <a href="https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/1091065215842570240">Duncan Jones has repeatedly bristled about its existence</a> on social media – and it has been prohibited from including a single Bowie song.

<p>Maradona spent his peak years at Napoli.

It’s not often a footballer features in an Oscar acceptance speech. Sorrentino had just won the best foreign language film award for his masterpiece <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review">La Grande Bellezza</a></em> and, hailing from Naples, the acclaimed filmmaker understood better than most what Maradona gave to the city.</p><p>Perhaps no player in the history of the game is as embedded into the fabric of a city as Maradona is in Naples. His image is everywhere. Negotiate your way through the narrow Spaccanapoli region of the city and you will see Neapolitans selling just about anything that can adorn Maradona’s face. Make your way to the similarly claustrophobic Quartieri Spagnoli<em> </em>district<em>,</em> walk up the steep, cobbled streets that bustle with everyday life, and gaze at his wall-size mural. Order a Neapolitan-style caffè in Bar Nilo on the corner of Via San Biagio, dedicated solely to Maradona, and observe your surroundings, complete with a single strand of Maradona mane, stolen from his headrest while he was on a flight back to Naples from Turin, and vials supposedly filled with tears of locals who cried upon his acrimonious departure from Italy in March 1991.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2020/oct/29/diego-maradona-60-best-goals-napoli-serie-a">Continue reading...</a>

Scream Queens blended the aesthetics of Murphy’s previous hits, American Horror Story and Glee, then slathered on layers of horror homage, cartoonish violence and campy dialogue to create a tart, but moreish confection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/29/from-scream-queens-to-spaceds-zombie-battle-our-favourite-tv-spine-chillers">Continue reading...</a>

Perhaps Smith deduced that mid-pandemic was not the right frame of mind to enjoy their latest album, which even hardcore fans would admit tends towards the self-absorbed and glum. There was also the “crying selfie” posted in March as Smith struggled to cope with lockdown: the inevitable criticism led by Piers Morgan prompted talk of a backlash.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/29/sam-smith-love-goes-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The rock star plays a wealthy art dealer mysteriously sheltering a renowned painter in this eventful melodrama</p><p>A sprightly and mischievous cameo from Mick Jagger is one reason to enjoy this movie. Donald Sutherland’s brief performance as a reclusive artist is another. It’s a suspense drama-thriller from Oscar-nominated screenwriter Scott Smith who has adapted the 1971 novel by crime author Charles Willeford. Claes Bang plays a somewhat raffish and disreputable Milan-based art critic, James Figueras. He is an egotistical individual with a morbid fear of flies (probably because of a sense of his own insignificance, buzzing parasitically around the greatness of artists).</p><p>Figueras is having a passionate affair with a beautiful American, Berenice (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/12/elizabeth-debicki-interview-im-not-interested-in-being-comfortable-spy-thriller">Elizabeth Debicki</a>), who dropped in to one of Figueras’s breezy, specious lectures and was amused in spite of herself. Figueras asks if she will come with him for the weekend to the home of Joseph Cassidy (Jagger), a fabulously wealthy art dealer and connoisseur who has just extended a mysterious invitation to Figueras to visit him at his gorgeous lakeside villa. Cassidy’s invitation is due to the fact that he has a secret houseguest, the legendary, reclusive painter Jerome Debney (Sutherland) who now lives in a cabin on Cassidy’s estate, working on paintings that he will show no one and Debney has a capricious interest in Figueras’s posturing columns in the press. But Cassidy himself has a terrible, Mephistophelean proposition to put to Figueras – who is in no position to refuse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/29/the-burnt-orange-heresy-review-mick-jagger-adds-dash-of-malice-to-arty-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manager takes his resurgent team to Arsenal in the Europa League two months after arriving as an unknown and unpopular choice</p><p>When the phone rang, Filippo Giovagnoli was enjoying an extended holiday in his home village. There had been a delay in renewing his US visa but otherwise there was little strain in spending August with family and friends around Apecchio, a tiny settlement in Le Marche. Then the name of his boss, Jeffrey Saunders, at the Metropolitan Oval academy in New York flashed up on the screen and life began moving at a million miles an hour.</p><p>“He said to me: ‘Look, you’re going to receive a call, so be ready,’” Giovagnoli says. It would be from Dundalk, who had just parted company with Vinny Perth and needed a head coach. Giovagnoli was, by most measures, not an obvious choice. At 49 he had never managed a senior team even if his time in the States, as the renowned academy’s director of coaching, was widely considered a success. Six years previously he had been overseeing Milan’s transatlantic summer camps for youngsters but he was about to be pitched in among the Europa League big boys.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/29/dundalk-filippo-giovagnoli-arsenal-europa-league-people-were-not-respectful">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a Minnesota inmate wrote to Alec Soth on impulse this year, the two began a freewheeling exchange of ideas on culture and isolation that developed into an astonishing new book </p><p>In January this year, having completed a working road trip, Alec Soth returned home to his native Minneapolis to find a letter marked Minnesota correctional facility. “Please forgive the audacity of this letter,” it began. “I reach out in great admiration and respect. For years, I have relied on photography for reference material, given my incarceration, and have developed a great admiration for the genre.”</p><p>The letter was signed C Fausto, short for Christopher Fausto Cabrera, an inmate who on “sheer impulse” had written to the photographer with “no real expectation, but to connect with other artists”. Intrigued, Soth decided to respond. “There was something about the letter,” he recalls. “A politeness and a sense that the guy was really bright and self-aware.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/29/a-roadmap-to-redemption-how-a-photographer-helped-a-prisoner-see-beyond-his-cage">Continue reading...</a>

## Shirley review – Elisabeth Moss gets under a horror writer's skin | Peter Bradshaw's film of the week

<p>As a fictionalised version of real-life author Shirley Jackson, Moss is satisfyingly cantankerous and contemptuous, but the film’s early menace fizzles out</p><p>If you can imagine that nice young couple Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes from Rosemary’s Baby showing up at the house belonging to Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton from Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and staying as house guests until their baby is born … well, you still won’t have much of an idea as to what this intriguing, frustrating film is like. It is acted with bravura and the sort of stormy histrionics and whisky hangovers enjoyed by 60s American campus couples indulging in drunken dinner parties and sneaky infidelities. And it’s directed to create a humidly intense atmosphere of emotional abuse as the women involved plunge obsessively down their various rabbit holes of self-discovery and self-harm to the orchestral accompaniment of atonal pizzicato and jarring piano chords.</p><p>It’s a process comparable to the one director Josephine Decker explored in her previous film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/08/madelines-madeline-review-molly-parker-helena-howard-miranda-july">Madeline’s Madeline</a>. But this film finally flinches from its own menacing implications and dark suspenseful power with a rather feeble ending of empowerment and solidarity.

Now, along with its sister show, its latest episodes feature topical coverage of a health system in peril</p><p>On 10 November, a stark, uncompromising episode of Holby City, set at the peak of the first Covid spike, is set to air. In it, staff nurse Donna Jackson likens her work to “walking into hell each day”, while clinical lead Ric Griffin expresses concern that the hospital is “not even close” to being prepared. CEO Max McGerry, meanwhile, is seen admitting to her staff that the PPE they are wearing is four years past its use-by date.</p><p>So profound has been the impact of the pandemic on the NHS, that when Casualty and Holby City resumed production recently, big changes had to be made.

GM announced it was closing its mammoth plant in Lordstown, Ohio, in November 2018 and ever since Amato has been ladling out advice to the 1,700 laid-off workers on such matters as how to obtain jobless benefits and how to qualify for government assistance to pay for college courses.</p><p>The GM plant, the size of more than 100 football fields, had long been the heart of Lordstown – as recently as 2016, it employed 4,500 workers, and in its 53-year history, it produced 16m vehicles. Built alongside I-80, the hulking plant has long been a monument to America’s industrial might, or perhaps one should say its fading industrial might.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/29/lordstown-ohio-trump-gm-plant-election">Continue reading...</a>

There is no doubt that 2020 has made life for those living with cancer even harder. It’s also become tougher for those of us who work in cancer care.</p><p>We’ve had to adapt our communication skills. For some patients, the shift to phone consultations is a welcome change. For others, a phone call removes the small talk part of consultations, where doctors and patients get to know each other.

The silences we so often employ in face to face conversations, generally intuitively without conscious thought, are awkward on the telephone. Video consultations are better, but do not equate to real life.

<p>Universities are waking up to the idea that it’s better to tackle student drug-taking through information, not punishment</p><p>When Rahim*, a first-year university student, went to a festival last year, his friends bought some MDMA from a dealer they met at a party. He was apprehensive, since he usually only buys off contacts he trusts not to cut their substances with unwanted chemicals.</p><p>So when his group stumbled across a harm reduction service, one friend decided to buy a testing kit. “Thank god he bought it, because one of the MDMA pills turned out to have meth in it,” says Rahim. “It was quite scary.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/29/ketamine-is-big-here-why-bristol-university-is-testing-drugs-for-its-students">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’ve been asking since June for a chargeback and getting nowhere</p><p><strong>Since June I have been trying to get M&amp;S Bank to carry out a £700 chargeback but, despite repeated promises, the money never arrives. It concerns two Virgin Atlantic flights that were cancelled. The airline would only offer alternative vouchers or rebooking, rather than the refund I wanted as the event I was due to fly out to had already happened without me.</strong></p><p><strong>I therefore asked the bank in June to make a chargeback to my current account.

<p>Our love of trees, and the solace they have brought this year, shines brightly in this pick spanning England and Wales</p><p>On the limestone pavement above Malham Cove stands a solitary ash tree. The deeply etched grooves of the weathered limestone draw your eye towards this isolated figure. In summer, butterflies and skylarks fly around its limbs, while ferns and flowers sprout from the pavement crevices where gnarled roots anchor. Less-bountiful seasons are identified by the colour, presence or absence of ash leaves. The tree becomes a perpetual reminder of time passing in this grey-washed landscape.

<p><strong>Wenlock Edge, Shropshire:</strong> These mushrooms are outrageously exhibitionist, and bring to mind an old song </p><p>“One for sorrow, two for joy” goes the old magpie rhyme, but these are not birds, these are mushrooms – <em>Coprinopsis picacea,</em> the magpie inkcap. There have been changes since the last time I walked this path between field and wood: a new wire fence erected, low-sweeping branches of an old oak lopped, debris and scrub cleared, pasture tidied and improved. In a patch where something has been disturbed under the fence is a cluster of amazing black and white fungi; fruiting bodies in various states of growth and decay. In this one patch, an egg pushes out of the ground; a dark bell-end with white feathery patches rises upwards on a stalk; at a foot tall, its cap rolls up and melts into a black inky gloop. “Three for a girl and four for a boy…”</p><p>The magpie inkcap is unusual and, although it is found in Britain and Ireland, throughout Europe and in North America, it’s rare to find such a strong group. Scientifically described in 1785 as <em>Coprinus</em> (an eater of dung) <em>picacea</em> <em>–</em> that looks like <em>Pica pica,</em> the magpie – it was renamed <em>Coprinopsis</em> at the beginning of this century because of DNA differences with other <em>Coprinus</em> species such as shaggy inkcap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/oct/29/country-diary-the-magic-of-magpie-inkcaps">Continue reading...</a>
