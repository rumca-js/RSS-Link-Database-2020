A little over 10 years later, this would not only become the biggest podcast in the world, but the most valuable at $100 million dollars after signing to Spotify recently.\n\nThe crazy part is that before the podcast, Joe Rogan has had one of the most diverse careers any major \u201cinfluencers\u201d have ever had. So let\u2019s take a look at the meteoric career of who\u2019s gotta be one of the most influential figures of our time - Joe Rogan.\n\nJoseph James Rogan didn\u2019t have the worst childhood ever, but it also wasn\u2019t that great according to him. Growing up in a troubled household, Joe Rogan developed an extremely obsessive personality. He was very interested in what he was interested in, and very uninterested in people telling him what to do.\n\nHe got into martial arts and that became the focus of his life. This was the first time in Joe\u2019s life where he didn\u2019t feel like a loser. Instantly, Joe\u2019s obsessiveness was 100% directed at training and fighting. Within two years he earned his black belt. At age 19, Joe started pondering the idea of fighting professionally.\n\nJoe and his martial arts friends were always in an intense environment. The idea of being a comedian never crossed his mind until his friends encouraged him to try it out. Mix that with the motivation to find a way out of fighting, and Joe found himself doing open mic nights. It went really well and within one year Joe found himself in LA for the next phase of his career.\n\nThe first sitcom show was called Hardball, but it got cancelled. He ended up starring on a hit sitcom called Newsradio. That show went on for 5 seasons while he was doing stand up on the side. Once the show ended, NBC pitched the idea of him hosting a new show without actors called Fear Factor. This was when his comedy career really reached a new level.\n\nThe first episode of the Joe Rogan Experience aired in December 2009. What started out as Joe just bantering with comedian friends eventually became a weekly thing, then they got it on iTunes. JRE now spans across the globe with over 1500 episodes. And today, the podcast has some truly incomprehensible numbers.\n\nSo what can we take away from Joe? The key to Genius, to being a genius, to doing something great like Joe, is the ability to connect different disciplines together. Be a jack of all trades, and a master\u2026 of one.\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
