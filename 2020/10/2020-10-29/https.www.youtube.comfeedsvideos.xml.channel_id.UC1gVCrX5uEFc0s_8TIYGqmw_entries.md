Filmed by Louis Lumiere at La Canebière street in Marseille, France.

We can see sardine sellers, American bar, trams and crowd walking by. This movie has a great value for the people of Marseille. Lumiere immortalizes city in 1896 for future generations. Thank you!

About a kilometre long, it runs from the Old Port of Marseille to the Réformés quarter. It has been called the Champs-Élysées of Marseille.
