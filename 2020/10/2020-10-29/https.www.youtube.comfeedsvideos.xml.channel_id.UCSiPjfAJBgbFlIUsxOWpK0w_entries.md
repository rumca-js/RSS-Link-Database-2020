LYRICS

Fucking hell I hate
Sleeping without you
So would it be ok
If somebody else stayed over
While you’re away
 
It’s not sexual it’s just
Contextual I swear
It’s like you don’t even care
 
What if I was assaulted
What if there was a demon in my bed
I know we’re all adults here
But I could trip and get electrocuted
Ok I realize it’s mostly in my head
But it only gets worse
Cause I’m tired I’m tired I’m tired to death
 
Holy shit it sucks
Turning the lights out
I’ll double-check the locks
And wear something practical just in case I need to bolt
 
I’m not paranoid
I just heard a noise downstairs
And like you weren’t even there
 
What if I was assaulted
What if there was a demon in my bed
I know we’re all adults here
But I could trip and get electrocuted
Ok I realize it’s mostly in my head
But it only gets worse
Cause I’m tired I’m tired I’m tired to death

Yeah I’m tired to death
I’m so tired yeah
Oh I’m tired to death
