Symptom Duration and Risk Factors for Delayed Return to Usual Health Among Outpatients with COVID-19

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32730238/

US CDC

Random sample of 292 adults who had tested positive

35% of 274 symptomatic respondents, not returned to usual health 14 – 16 days after testing

18 – 34 year olds

N = 85, 26%. (74% returned to normal)

35-49 years

N = 96, 32% (68% returned to normal)

50 and older

N = 89, 47% (53% returned to normal)

Post–intensive care syndrome

6 – 12 months, cognitive, mental health, physical function

Persistent Symptoms in Patients After Acute COVID-19 (JAMA, July 2020, Rome)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2768351

143 patients discharged from the hospital

18 patients (12.6%) were completely free of any COVID-19–related symptoms after a mean of 60 days

Therefore 87.4 not returned to full normal

Manifestations

None of the patients had fever or any signs or symptoms of acute illness

Worsened quality of life, 44.1% 

Pathogenesis

Direct tissue invasion by the virus

The virus cleares from most of the body, but lingers in some small pockets
 
If there's long-term diarrhoea then you find the virus in the gut, if there's loss of smell it is in the nerves - so that could be what's causing the problem (Tim Spector)
