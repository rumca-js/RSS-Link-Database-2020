While those of us without a rooting interest in these Finals are probably hoping that the Miami Heat can find a way to extend the season with a win against the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5, we should admit that it’s something of a minor miracle that we’ve reached the point at all. Despite overwhelming odds against them, the league figured out a way to restart the season, after an extended break, without exposing their employees to a Covid-19 outbreak. The Bubble, despite <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/24/nba-disney-world-return-basketball-coronavirus-florida">the legitimate fears many of us had</a> before the season resumed at Walt Disney World, has not burst.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-10-09T17:35:02.552Z">6.35pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p><strong>Hunter will be here shortly.</strong> In the meantime <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/09/lebron-james-etan-thomas-nba-finals">here’s Etan Thomas’s column</a> from today looking back on his experiences facing LeBron James during his playing days.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/09/lebron-james-etan-thomas-nba-finals">LeBron ended my NBA title hopes three times.

<p>Last weekend the River Ouzel in Bedfordshire broke its banks after rainfall well above what meteorologists used to think possible</p><p>Forty years ago a public inquiry was held into a plan to build a forklift truck factory on the flood plain of the River Ouzel in Bedfordshire; experts were called in to assess the increased risk to nearby properties if the project went ahead. Evidence was given that for the site to be flooded the river would have to be swollen by an inch of rain in 24 hours – a very rare event the inquiry was told.</p><p>Planning permission was given but the factory was never built because the business went bust before the scheme could go ahead. Perhaps just as well: these rare events have since become more frequent and <a href="https://www.itv.com/news/anglia/2020-10-04/fire-crews-called-to-multiple-reports-of-flooding-in-bucks-and-mk-area">last weekend</a> more than an inch of rain fell on each of two consecutive days.

<p>Adolescence is the perfect storm for relationships between teen boys and their parents, but they are more vulnerable than they seem</p><p>Teen boys are a universally maligned group, frequently seen as a scourge to orderly society. Yet underneath the often hard-to-chat-to, starving, forgetful, restless, accident-prone boy is a big heart yearning to be understood and valued.</p><p>Any teen can struggle with relationships as they venture into adolescence and some key biological drivers make this struggle real. There’s the need for autonomy and independence, the hunger to belong with friends and peers, and the search for identity, which all teens experience during the child to adult transformation. These coincide with brain, hormonal, physical, psychological and emotional changes. Adolescence is the perfect storm for challenging relationships with parents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/10/seven-tips-for-parenting-teen-boys-nagging-them-is-like-shouting-into-a-void">Continue reading...</a>

He had previously <a href="https://twitter.com/TorstenBell/status/1314487897697980416" title="">defied</a> calls to introduce such support. Instead he had opted to provide state cash for “viable” jobs, defined as employment where people could work part-time. Now the chancellor has had to make a U-turn. As reality bites, it may be the first of many.</p><p>Mr Sunak does not exist in a bubble. Harold Macmillan reportedly expressed this point pithily when, asked what caused governments most trouble, he replied with the now-famous: “Events, dear boy, events.” Because the chancellor held a <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/politics/rishi-sunak-says-he-has-confidence-in-dido-harding-after-test-and-trace-blunder/" title="">Panglossian</a> view of how well Boris Johnson’s government was doing in the pandemic, he did not envisage that he would need to save jobs or businesses again with government spending.

<p>French Open final between the Pole, a relaxed introvert, and the American Kenin, who displays a tightly strung intensity, will be a fascinating duel <br /></p><p>Just over eight months ago, the former world No 1 Garbiñe Muguruza arrived in the Australian Open final favoured to squash the lowly rated Sofia Kenin. In the third set, Muguruza finally made her move by rushing to a 0-40 lead at 2-2 and threatening to snatch the momentum. Instead, Kenin responded with one of the great under-pressure games of recent times. Against a far stronger opponent she stood on the baseline and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY1DeATclio&amp;t=1h50m09s">blazed five winners</a> in a row from triple break-point down. She did not lose another game.</p><p>At the time, when people were still unsure of the heights Kenin could hope to reach, it was easy to conclude that her boldness was an anomaly. However, over the past two weeks in Paris Kenin was pushed to three sets in four of her first five matches and she has constantly demonstrated her ability to elevate her level under pressure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/09/stark-opposites-iga-swiatek-and-sofia-kenin-meet-in-glimpse-of-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Meddling with Brexit, mulling a new leader – the Tories will do literally anything except reflect on their Covid response<br /></p><p>Another week, another opportunity to wonder if the country has slipped through a tear in the government-Covid continuum. It was back in March, you might recall, that Boris Johnson explained we would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/boris-johnson-covid-19-prime-minister-brexit">turn the tide</a> on the coronavirus in 12 weeks, despite the fact that people as clinically clueless as even me could see that would not be the case. This was partly why so many Britons went into a deep psychiatric decline a fortnight ago, when Johnson suddenly dropped the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/22/coronavirus-boris-johnson-sets-out-new-covid-restrictions-at-perilous-turning-point">six months of restrictions</a>” bomb. Given his history of hopelessly optimistic margins of error, that could mean we’ll be out of the woods as early as 2036.</p><p>Apologies for jumping around the timeline. Having forecast the tide-turning, Johnson then explained of the virus that he was “absolutely confident” that we could “send it packing in this country”. Strangely, it still appears to be with us. Then again, perhaps we and Johnson understand different things by the phrase “sent packing”. For many years, Johnson’s experience of being “sent packing” meant he was readmitted to the family home in fairly short order, allowing him to make some more promises to break when he next felt like it. If it helps, think of the virus as the sexually incontinent husband in the nation’s spare room. “You have to believe me, love – I’ve CHANGED.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/09/learn-lessons-first-wave-boris-johnson-brexit-new-leader-tories-covid">Continue reading...</a>

## Masochism for the masses: why The Fall is still so dangerously gripping

<p>The 2013 series about a serial killer and the police officer hunting him – now on Netflix in the UK – feels like it is particularly aiming to scare women who live alone. Is that fair?</p><p>Fearful of a second lockdown and having worked my way in recent years through most of the spicy water-cooler British television series – your Broadchurches, your Doctor Fosters – I decided lately to get into The Fall, now available on Netflix. It seems I’m not the only one – since it became available on the streaming service, it has been a constant presence in the Top 10.</p><p>In The Fall’s favour, it did what I wanted it to, which was to compel me so thoroughly that I wasn’t tempted to scroll through the news as I watched. On the other hand, it made me so acutely anxious that I was doing a little jig of horror at the end of the first episode, and humming loudly to stop my empty flat feeling so bristlingly malign.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/09/masochism-for-the-masses-why-the-fall-is-still-so-dangerously-gripping">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scarf prints appeal because they are rooted in a comforting old-normal</p><p>Most years I am genuinely excited about “new trends” come autumn, but this year they feel like an abstract concept. When autumn collections sashayed under catwalk glitter showers in early February, coronavirus was still just a news story, rather than a way of life. What relevance do predictions that designers made six months ago about what we’d want to wear for party season have in a season of government-enforced early nights?</p><p>So I find myself sceptical about why we should buy into a template for now that was dreamed up back in the old normal. If designers had a crystal ball back in February, then – guys, did you forget to charge it?

She captured the light falling through white blossom and green leaf on to the brown earth of a vegetable patch and the lawn it bordered. She painted the garden hedge running across the small canvas, thereby planting you – the viewer – firmly inside it, safe under a cloudless sky.

Specialising in painting but also sculpture, drawing and prints from 1880-1980, they have spent the last 30-odd years working with museums and institutions, and private collections. They’ve visited hundreds of musty studios, combed through archives and ferreted around garrets to root out the work of artists who, though lauded in their day, have since fallen into oblivion: from erstwhile prize winners and residents of the British School at Rome to the shyer contemporaries of luminaries such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/henry-moore">Henry Moore</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/30/eric-ravilious-painting-landscape-watercolour">Eric Ravil</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/apr/30/eric-ravilious-painting-landscape-watercolour">ious</a>.

<p>Worried that coronavirus will destroy your job? The government’s careers advice service has some ridiculous alternatives for you</p><p>Rishi Sunak made quite a splash with the suggestion that musicians should retrain. Did the chancellor really say that? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/08/the-arts-rishi-sunak-job-chancellor-hope">It was a little bit more circuitous</a>, but close enough to justify an outpouring of rage. The rumour is that Sunak will be the leader next time the Conservatives present themselves to the country (having first cycled through Michael Gove, after Boris Johnson decides he has had enough). Sunak and his party should reflect on the fact that his moments of modest popularity are only when he is hosing money at people like a broken cash machine.</p><p>Musicians, meanwhile, were full of new career ideas: they would retrain as someone with rich parents; they would retrain as large outsourcing companies with no expertise in the arena of public health, and 10m quid would surely follow, which, hey, a few of them could share. On Tuesday, 400 of them made a heartrending point about their predicament by <a href="https://twitter.com/andrewkeates/status/1313786340945924102?s=20">playing Holst’s Mars in Parliament Square</a>.

## Sayaka Murata: 'I acted how I thought a cute woman should act - it was horrible'

<p>The author of Convenience Store Woman talks about working behind the counter, rejecting marriage and children, and her dark new tale of murder and cannibalism</p><p>Until recently, Sayaka Murata, who won Japan’s most prestigious literary award, the Akutagawa prize, worked in a convenience store. She had toiled in them for half her life, writing most of her 11 novels and two nonfiction books in her time off. Even after becoming a bestselling author (<em>Konb</em><em>ini Ningen,</em> or <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/07/convenience-store-woman-sayaka-murata-review">Convenience Store Woman</a>,</em> sold 1.4m copies and has been translated into 30 languages), she continued to work behind the counter until the attentions of an obsessive fan forced her to stop. “I was so used to the rhythm of working that I found it hard to hang around all day writing,” she explains.</p><p>The novel’s oddball title character, Keiko Furukura, also relishes the predictable rhythms of her workplace. Japan’s 55,000 nearly identical convenience stores are considered stop-gap employers for job-hoppers, students, housewives and immigrants, “all losers”, says one of the characters in her book contemptuously. But Keiko, who is 36, a virgin and uninterested in the bourgeois lives of her married peers, excels at the pliant, robotic service demanded by the industry’s manuals. So unsettled is she by invasive questions about her lack of a husband and children that she takes in a lazy, abusive lodger just to deflect them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/09/sayaka-murata-i-acted-how-i-thought-a-cute-woman-should-act-it-was-horrible">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since Boris Johnson’s government has begun to struggle, it’s striking that its talk of a ‘war on woke’ has increased</p><p>Over the last few years, a new fear has been forming in the already anxious minds of liberal and leftwing Britons. The fear is that the right, made more aggressive by an injection of populism, is no longer satisfied by dominating national politics and defining the shape of the economy. It wants to dominate British culture as well.</p><p>Starting with the Brexit campaign, the right has launched a series of culture wars: against remainers, the BBC, the universities, the legal system, the big cities and seemingly anywhere that liberal or leftwing thinking still lingers strongly, despite a decade of Tory rule. These culture wars have mobilised and united conservative Britons, ensured that debates about patriotism and social cohesion are conducted on rightwing terms and helped the Tories win a big parliamentary majority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/09/tories-culture-war-right-fearless-boris-johnson-war-on-woke">Continue reading...</a>

Britain has a parliamentary system not a presidential one. It’s important to keep it that way and not undermine it. In a parliamentary system, the prime minister should be answerable to MPs in the House of Commons first, and to the media second. When John Bercow was Speaker, but also now under his successor, Lindsay Hoyle, there has been a big effort to make sure that this happens more regularly and more fully. The new post, with its proposed daily televised on-the-record briefings, deliberately turns that on its head.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/09/allegra-stratton-downing-street-press-secretary-mistake">Continue reading...</a>

Now, the kind of explicitly homophobic and racist media vilification that Justin faced is unthinkable – even if, of course, homophobic and racist media still persist.</p><p> The idea of the past as host to revolutionary struggles that mapped out a better world for Black Britons is at the core of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/04/black-history-month-is-now-an-established-part-of-the-year-lets-celebrate-its-success">Black History Month</a>, as well as major cultural events such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/30/notting-hill-carnival-online-is-more-relevant-than-ever-says-director">Notting Hill </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/aug/30/notting-hill-carnival-online-is-more-relevant-than-ever-says-director">carnival</a>.

## Kevin Bacon: 'I couldn't care less about being heroic or handsome'

<p>Having broken through off Broadway with Sean Penn and Val Kilmer, it’s no surprise that the actor has spent 35 years striving to put being a teen idol behind him. ‘I’m drawn to dark things,’ he says</p><p>Alarm bells would ring for most couples if one partner suggested marriage as the perfect subject for a horror movie. Kevin Bacon does not seem perturbed, though, that his latest film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/18/you-should-have-left-review-kevin-bacon-v-evil-house-in-flat-horror">You Should Have Left</a>, was inspired by just such an idea that his wife, the actor Kyra Sedgwick, came up with.</p><p>“I’m drawn to dark things,” he says down the phone from their farm in Connecticut. “On some level, it’s therapeutic. I have a marriage that works and I didn’t have a tremendous amount of trauma as a child and yet I feel all human beings have darkness in their souls. Fear and anger and doubt live within us. Part of what I like about my job is tapping into those demons. I became an actor because I wanted to explore all sides of the human condition. Being heroic or handsome or winning the big game – I couldn’t care less about those things! But to go into the darker corners of a man’s psyche is an interesting thing to do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/09/kevin-bacon-interview-you-should-have-left-care-less-about-being-heroic-or-handsome">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Last month the equalities minister, Liz Truss, announced that some reforms to the Gender Recognition Act would go ahead but one key aspect – allowing trans people to self-identify without a medical diagnosis - would not be adopted. The issue has divided ‘gender critical’ feminists from those who are more trans-inclusive. Is there a route to reconciliation? </p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/oct/08/understanding-the-fight-over-trans-rights-part-1">Listen to part 1</a><br /></li></ul><p>Yesterday we told the story of how legal battles fought by committed campaigners, such as Stephen Whittle, helped establish transgender rights in the UK. The 2004 Gender Recognition Act (GRA) formalised them in a single act of parliament, but in recent years campaigners have pushed for an expansion of those rights. Last month the equalities minister, Liz Truss, brought forward the government’s proposed changes to the GRA. They included cutting the costs associated with legal transition and a commitment to open new gender clinics. However, the government said it would not be adopting a right of self-declaration for trans people without a medical diagnosis. <br /></p><p>Joining <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>to discuss the issue are the feminist author <strong>Finn Mackay</strong>,<strong> </strong>who believes that while feminist divisions over trans rights are not new, they need not be inevitable, and <strong>Kathleen Stock</strong>, a philosophy professor who describes herself as “gender critical” and argues that gender identity should not be placed on an equal footing with biological sex when considering changes to the law. <strong>Mridul Wadhwa </strong>tells Anushka that as a trans woman working in a rape crisis centre, she has seen up close the importance of providing tailored services to women of all backgrounds. The Guardian’s <strong>Libby Brooks </strong>has been reporting on countries that have allowed trans people to self-declare their legal gender. She says that in the case of Ireland, the changes were introduced without the toxic debate that has grown around the issue in the UK.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2020/oct/09/understanding-the-fight-over-trans-rights-part-2">Continue reading...</a>
