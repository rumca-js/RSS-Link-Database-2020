While those of us without a rooting interest in these Finals are probably hoping that the Miami Heat can find a way to extend the season with a win against the Los Angeles Lakers in Game 5, we should admit that it\u2019s something of a minor miracle that we\u2019ve reached the point at all. Despite overwhelming odds against them, the league figured out a way to restart the season, after an extended break, without exposing their employees to a Covid-19 outbreak. The Bubble, despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/24/nba-disney-world-return-basketball-coronavirus-florida\">the legitimate fears many of us had</a> before the season resumed at Walt Disney World, has not burst.</p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-10-09T17:35:02.552Z\">6.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p><strong>Hunter will be here shortly.</strong> In the meantime <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/09/lebron-james-etan-thomas-nba-finals\">here\u2019s Etan Thomas\u2019s column</a> from today looking back on his experiences facing LeBron James during his playing days.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/09/lebron-james-etan-thomas-nba-finals\">LeBron ended my NBA title hopes three times.

The 2004 Gender Recognition Act (GRA) formalised them in a single act of parliament, but in recent years campaigners have pushed for an expansion of those rights. Last month the equalities minister, Liz Truss, brought forward the government\u2019s proposed changes to the GRA. They included cutting the costs associated with legal transition and a commitment to open new gender clinics. However, the government said it would not be adopting a right of self-declaration for trans people without a medical diagnosis. <br /></p><p>Joining <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>to discuss the issue are the feminist author <strong>Finn Mackay</strong>,<strong> </strong>who believes that while feminist divisions over trans rights are not new, they need not be inevitable, and <strong>Kathleen Stock</strong>, a philosophy professor who describes herself as \u201cgender critical\u201d and argues that gender identity should not be placed on an equal footing with biological sex when considering changes to the law. <strong>Mridul Wadhwa </strong>tells Anushka that as a trans woman working in a rape crisis centre, she has seen up close the importance of providing tailored services to women of all backgrounds. The Guardian\u2019s <strong>Libby Brooks </strong>has been reporting on countries that have allowed trans people to self-declare their legal gender. She says that in the case of Ireland, the changes were introduced without the toxic debate that has grown around the issue in the UK.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2020/oct/09/understanding-the-fight-over-trans-rights-part-2\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/audio/2020/oct/09/understanding-the-fight-over-trans-rights-part-2", "date_published": "2020-10-09 02:00:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
