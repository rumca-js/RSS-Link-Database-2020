<p>From Zandra Rhodes’s Rainbow Penthouse, to Grace Coddington’s Long Island retreat, what do the homes of top creatives reveal about them?</p><p>Colour has always played a central role in the career of designer Zandra Rhodes throughout her more than 50 years as a self-described “notorious figurehead of the UK fashion industry”. The designer’s trademark pink hair and outrageous clothes are as colourful as her home, the so-called Rainbow Penthouse, which she bought in 1995 on Bermondsey Street in southeast London. Her apartment sits on top of the <a href="https://www.ftmlondon.org/" title="">Fashion and Textile Museum</a>, founded by Rhodes in 2003. Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta rejuvenated the warehouse building, incorporating a split-level, two-bedroom home. The lower level houses the bedrooms, galley kitchen and textile print room.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/24/inner-visions-inside-the-homes-of-the-worlds-most-creative-people">Continue reading...</a>

## Sun Ra Arkestra: Swirling review – out of this world

<p>(Strut)<br />The Arkestra’s first album in 20 years is an intoxicating, cosmic tribute to Sun Ra</p><p>For much of his long, prolific career, the late Sun Ra (born plain Herman Blount) found his music marginalised. Though rooted in jazz tradition, its atonal tunings and proto-electronica, along with its space-age themes and gaudy costumes, were too way out for an era of studied, mohair-suited cool. Since his death in 1993, however, Ra has become hailed as a pioneer of Afrofuturism, whose influence runs from Funkadelic to <em>Black Panther</em>. Meanwhile Ra’s band, <a href="http://www.sunraarkestra.com/">the Arkestra</a>, have toured tirelessly, presided over by alto saxophonist Marshall Allen, now 96.</p><p>This first album in 20 years proves an inspired tribute to the master, revisiting celebrated pieces like Satellites Are Spinning, with its promise <em>“</em>A better day is breaking/ The planet Earth’s awakening”<em>, </em>beautifully sung by violinist Tara Middleton. The vocalised, upbeat mood (Ra was essentially utopian) maintains through the bebop riff of Rocket Number Nine, and Allen’s title track, whose finger-snapping big band arrangement evokes a nightclub on Mars, while the swaying Egyptian melody of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8wbqgy_q3k&amp;ab_channel=StrutRecords">Angels and Demons at Play</a> and the foreboding Sea of Darkness come from deeper space. It’s a heady brew, challenging but intoxicating. Ra always said his music was from the future… and now it has arrived. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/24/sun-ra-arkestra-swirling-review-out-of-this-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US Justice Department’s complaint that the tech giant has monopolised the web is too little, too late </p><p>So, in the dying days of Trump’s first term, the US Department of Justice (DoJ) has finally taken Google to court. Attorney general William Barr, in conjunction with the AGs of 11 states, has filed a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/20/us/doj-google-suit.html">58-page complaint</a> under the Sherman Act “to restrain Google LLC (Google) from unlawfully maintaining monopolies in the markets for general search services, search advertising and general search text advertising in the United States through anticompetitive and exclusionary practices, and to remedy the effects of this conduct”.</p><p>Google’s initial response was predictable: a <a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/response-doj/">blog post</a> headed “A deeply flawed lawsuit that would do nothing to help consumers”. The DoJ’s lawsuit, apparently, “is deeply flawed. People use Google because they choose to, not because they’re forced to, or because they can’t find alternatives.” There then follow useful animated gifs showing how easy it is to change your preferred search engine on your phone etc. But of course there’s no mention of the anticompetitive <em>behaviour</em> cited in the government’s suit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/24/you-dont-need-a-search-engine-to-see-why-google-wont-lose-this-lawsuit">Continue reading...</a>

## Claire Wilcox: 'When I look at clothing, I’m thinking about narratives’

<p>The V&amp;A’s fashion curator has written an acclaimed memoir about her life among the many dresses, hats, shoes and other items the museum houses</p><p>Claire Wilcox thinks she makes for a highly unlikely fashion curator. “It’s a bit embarrassing, really,” she says. “I’m always complaining to friends that I haven’t got a thing to wear.” Ask what piece of clothing she most aches to own – you can have anything, I say, irrespective of cost or rarity – and she will talk not of Balenciaga or Schiaparelli, but of “Dorelia John-style peasant blouses.” (Dorelia McNeill, a painter and artist’s model, lived with Augustus John and his wife, Ida, in a menage a trois that sometimes took up residence in a Gypsy caravan). For the record, today she looks a touch Cossack in black lace-up boots whose provenance she cannot quite recall, matching trousers from Cos and – oh dear – a hand-printed shirt that she bought from the shop in the Victoria and Albert Museum, which also happens to be the institution where she has worked for the last 20 years.</p><p>Nevertheless, it seems to have been written in the stars that she would one day end up here in London’s South Kensington, thinking about buttons and ballgowns; about how, as she puts it, fashion exists “in the folds of time”, its roots always in the past, but also in the present, too, since human beings will never not need clothes. It all goes back to her childhood. First, there was the haberdashery her parents ran not so very far away in West Kensington: as a girl, she would often accompany her mother to work, spending her days among the paper patterns and the knitting wool, the rolls of rickrack and bias binding. Then there was the junk shop in Pimlico her father opened after she graduated from university. “He let me do his windows for him,” she says. “And I had grandiose ideas. I used to create these extraordinary stage sets with my brother, with columns and swags and mirrors. When people came in, you could tell they were thinking, ‘Oh, but the inside looks nothing like the window’ and I would get furious if he sold anything from the window because it would ruin my display.” Ever since, she has been the kind of person who gets “star-struck by objects rather than people”. Should she follow someone on the street, as she has occasionally been known to do, it will be their clothes she’s interested in, not their face.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/24/claire-wilcox-when-i-look-at-clothing-im-thinking-about-narratives-v-and-a">Continue reading...</a>

For a rider who had expected to support either Richard Carapaz or Geraint Thomas in an attempt for overall victory, it is an astonishing twist of fortune.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/24/cycling-giro-ditalia-stage-20-report-jai-hindley-tao-geoghegan-hart-pink-jersey">Continue reading...</a>

## The Climb review – a shrewd portrayal of male friendship

<p>This smart indie drama captures the ebb and flow of a flagging relationship</p><p><em>The Climb</em> begins with heavy panting; it’s pitch dark. But writer-director (and lead actor) Michael Angelo Covino is teasing us: what appears to be a sex scene cuts to a different shared experience. Best friends Mike (Covino) and Kyle (Kyle Marvin, who co-writes) are in the south of France on a stag do, struggling to breathe as they cycle up a particularly steep hill. An extended tracking shot that lasts nearly 10 minutes captures an awkward conversation, in which best man Mike confesses he has been sleeping with Kyle’s fiancee.</p><p>Using Covino’s 2018 short of the same name as a starting point, this smart indie drama uses a series of vignettes to explore the ebb and flow of Mike and Kyle’s relationship. Thanksgiving, Christmas, a funeral and a ski trip all provide different vantage points from which to view their increasingly stale bond. The camera is an attentive and curious observer, Zach Kuperstein’s fluid cinematography capturing the constantly shifting power in any given room. “Are you guys playing Never Have I Ever?” asks Kyle’s girlfriend Marissa (a lively Gayle Rankin), raising an eyebrow at the drunken thirtysomethings. “Yeah, we’re catching up,” replies Kyle. The film is shrewd on male friendship, suggesting that a lot of men are vulnerable and crave intimacy, but are often too poor at communicating to truly reach for it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/24/the-climb-review-a-shrewd-portrayal-of-male-friendship">Continue reading...</a>

## One to watch: Lous and the Yakuza
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/24/one-to-watch-lous-and-the-yakuza](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/24/one-to-watch-lous-and-the-yakuza)

<p>The Congolese-Belgian rapper’s debut album is a hypnotic testament to her powers of survival</p><p><em>Gore</em>, the title of Lous and the Yakuza’s debut album, is more philosophy than aesthetic. It represents Marie-Pierra Kakoma’s acceptance that the worst has surely passed; a camp encapsulation of horrors endured that she can only laugh at, lest she cry. She was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. After her mother was imprisoned for two months during the country’s 1998 war, the family moved to a violent Brussels neighbourhood. They went back again after six years in Rwanda, in the brutal aftermath of genocide. Despite raising her on Chopin and Mozart, Kakoma’s parents cut her off when she wanted to pursue music over medicine. During a period of homelessness, she was assaulted and considered sex work for survival.</p><p>Somehow, Kakoma’s spirit and ambition endured. Having little to lose, she refused to compromise in pursuit of her dream career, meticulously raking over the terms of her Columbia contract and refusing their proposed collaborators until she found an ideal match in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/aug/22/el.guincho">Spain’s El Guincho</a>, who produced Rosalía’s breakout, <em>El Mal Querer</em>. The two records share a supreme sense of elegance, but that’s all. Kakoma sings and raps with lace-like intricacy and a hypnotic sense of melody as El Guincho teases skittish trap and reverential vocals into a holy atmosphere. As serene as it sounds, her French lyrics don’t skimp on the realities of her life and the post-colonial conditions that created them. “I want people to understand the reality of a young black woman living in Europe,” <a href="https://redbullelektropedia.be/article/fresh-on-the-scene-lous-and-the-yakuza">she says</a>. In that sense, “gore” feels like a pointed understatement. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/24/one-to-watch-lous-and-the-yakuza">Continue reading...</a>

## How to grow walnuts | Alys Fowler

<p>A small tree, in a warm spot, will shower you with walnuts within five years – if the squirrels don’t get there first</p><p>Squirrels are bastards. How else can you explain every single walnut on the tree gnawed through to its bitter green husks, the unripe nut cracked open only for the thief to discover that the flavour is not to his liking. There is not much to salvage from such nibbled nuts in terms of eating, but the fleshy outer husks make an excellent dye that ranges from yellow to pinkish grey to deep brown, depending on the age of the husk and what fixer is used. It is easily extracted in water brought to the boil.</p><p>So, to the soundtrack of mocking squirrels, I picked up the spoiled nuts and cooked up a vast vat of dye. We may end up looking like medieval monks by the time I have finished dyeing all our faded white T-shirts, but I feel, at least, that I have honoured the harvest, for it has been a bumper year for walnuts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/24/how-to-grow-walnuts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Enjoy an hour of chaos with your small people making these yoghurt lollies, eggs hiding in filo nests and spicy sausage rolls</p><p>In my experience, anyone who gives advice on how to cook with kids doesn’t have kids. The vision – that it’s all going to be fun, relaxed and bonding – does not, of course, always pan out. The only rule I’d stand by is the “whatever works for you” school of thought. That said, there <em>are</em> a few things I do believe when it comes to children and food. One is that few things aren’t improved by the addition of a baked egg, melted cheese and/or a squeeze of ketchup, or by being wrapped in all-butter puff pastry and eaten by hand. Second, colour is a big draw: to a little person, beetroot and yoghurt lollies, say, are not beetroot and yoghurt lollies – rather, they are a magical, colourful, kaleidoscopic swirl of pink and white.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/24/spiced-sausage-rolls-beetroot-yoghurt-ripple-lollies-egg-cheese-leek-zaatar-filo-nests-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-cooking-with-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Herminder Channa, recently awarded an OBE, has transformed an academy at the centre of the Islamic extremism scandal</p><p>Running a school on love is a challenge, especially one riven by hate and failed by Ofsted. Five years ago, when Herminder Channa took over Golden Hillock, it was one of the schools at the centre of the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/17/birmingham-schools-inquiry-hardline-sunni-islam-trojan-horse">Trojan horse”</a> attempt by a group of Muslim governors and senior teachers to impose the <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/340526/HC_576_accessible_-.pdf">dictates</a> of a hardline and politicised strand of Sunni Islam.</p><p>A government inquiry in July 2014 concluded that, though claims of a conspiracy were not proved, there was clear evidence that people in a position of influence in the school were espousing – or failing to challenge – extremist views and forcing on staff “an intolerant and aggressive Islamic influence”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/oct/24/headteacher-who-healed-a-birmingham-trojan-horse-school-we-did-it-with-love">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She made her name playing sunny sweethearts, but now James is going gothic in a new Rebecca. She talks getting spooked on set, Covid bubbles and co-stars </p><p>The problem with trying to be an actor but also trying to stay sane, says <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lily-james" title="">Lily James</a>, is that you need a really thin skin to do the work, and a very thick one to withstand the rejection or the criticism. “You have to let everything affect you, everything hit your nerves, so you can perform. So it feels as if you’re constantly trying to guard yourself or let people in, put walls up or break them down. Your roots are often being ripped out and put somewhere else, so it’s sometimes harder to feel that stability in life which… yeah.”</p><p>She trails off, taking a sip of her tea as we sit in the drizzly garden of the Somerset hotel where she’s staying, having decided she can keep her mask off as we are outside, at opposite ends of a table. She’s dressed in civvies: baggy dark green trousers that would vanish you in a forest, her hair its natural brown, a star who could hide in plain sight. Far enough into fame, after a decade in the business, to know how to hold some of herself back, but young enough (at only 31) to still want to give it all away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/24/lily-james-sucked-into-the-vortex-rebecca">Continue reading...</a>

## Boris Johnson is learning that in politics you cannot simply 'follow the science' | David Runciman

<p>The prime minister is trying to pretend that nakedly political decisions are driven by data. But almost no one buys it</p><p>What happened to following the science? In the spring, when Boris Johnson and his scientific advisers were proceeding in lockstep, there was no disagreement about the necessity of shutting the country down. Now the government is coming to its own conclusions about what is needed, and the scientists on the Sage advisory group have started distancing themselves from No 10’s decisions.</p><p>Critics complain that the politicians are chancing it rather than being led by the evidence. But as the German sociologist Max Weber argued a century ago, politics can never really follow the science. Pretending that it can is where the trouble starts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/24/boris-johnson-politics-science-prime-minister-data">Continue reading...</a>
