What does this mean? For the former it means making some tweaks to the way its existing services work in order for the transition to PlayStation 5 to be a little more smooth. For the latter it means dishing out new information on the ways Xbox Series X/S owners will be able to make the most of their brand new hardware.\n\nOn this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor tackle the aforementioned tweaks Sony is making. More specifically, they talk about the changes to the PlayStation Store, which has been redesigned somewhat. Tune in to find out what's new, what's changed, what's gone, and what it all means.

With Pikmin 3 Deluxe right around the corner, we thought now would be a good time to take an expedition through the history of Pikmin.\n\nThe brainchild of Shigeru Miyamoto, Pikmin tasks you with growing and managing little vegetable creatures who aid you in battle, help solve puzzles, and collect treasure for you. In one game you only have 30 days to live, and in another you have to gather food for your home planet, but usually you end up crash landing no matter the circumstances. Pikmin first released on the Nintendo GameCube in 2001 and has grown from there.\n\nPikmin has only had three mainline entries so far, aptly named Pikmin, Pikmin 2, and Pikmin 3, but the franchise isn\u2019t limited to just those three games. There\u2019s a 3DS spin-off titled Hey! Pikmin, as well as a series of Pikmin Short Movies on YouTube, while\u00a0 series mainstay Captain Olimar has appeared in multiple Super Smash Bros. entries. There\u2019s also a possible Pikmin 4 on the way, with Miyamoto confirming its existence twice.\u00a0\n\nPikmin 3 Deluxe, an enhanced port of the original Pikmin 3 on Wii U, is headed to Nintendo Switch with a new prologue and epilogue along with other additions like new difficulty modes and the Piklopedia. Pikmin 3 Deluxe will release on October 30, 2020.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:31 - Pikmin's Origins & Initial Concepts\n02:12 - Pikmin (2001)\n02:52 - Pikmin 2 (2004)\n05:05 - Pikmin 3's Iterations (Handheld & Wii)\n05:36 - New Play Control!
