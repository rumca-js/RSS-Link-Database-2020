Global

World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

Critical juncture, tough times ahead for the countries in the Northern Hemisphere

The next few months are going to be very tough and some countries are on a dangerous track

an exponential increase in cases in many nations

Leading to hospital increases

Governments need to act x 5

1. Assess current situation in your country, identify cases and clusters, conduct honest analysis

2. Make necessary adjustments to health facilities

3. Be clear and honest with people 

4. Put systems in place to make it easier to comply, assist individuals and groups

5. Share good practice, speak to people with specific instructions, isolate all cases and quarantine contacts, its never too late to act

Fall/winter surge has begun, cases and deaths

Several weeks behind the massive surge in Europe

Surge will intensify in November and December, reaching a peak in January

Many states, enormous pressure on hospital capacity

Re-impose some social distancing mandates

Expand mask use

 Current situation 

Cases and deaths up

Deaths, 680 per day last week, now 710

Effective R, over 1 in many Northern states

Also in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Alabama

Trends in key drivers of transmission (mobility, mask use, testing, and seasonality)
 
Largely unchanged over the last week

Mobility remains constant at the national level

Only California and Hawaii have levels that are less than 35% of the pre-COVID-19 baseline

Approximately two-thirds, wearing a mask outside the home

Lowest mask use rates are in Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota
 
Projections 

Daily deaths to reach nearly 2,200 a day in mid-January

Cumulative deaths by February 1, 386,000

Assumes re-imposition of social distancing mandates when the daily death rate reaches 8 
per million

Expanding mask use to 95% ....

the level seen in Singapore

can greatly delay the imposition of mandates and save 
63,000 lives

ONS

Deaths, England and Wales, week ending 9 October 2020 (Week 41)

Deaths registered was 1.5% (143 deaths) above the five-year average

The number would have to get to 1,200 deaths above the norm to be classified as "excess" above random expected variations

Deaths from coronavirus, flu and pneumonia are currently running at 1,621

There would usually be around 1,600 weekly deaths from flu and pneumonia

Therefore, respiratory deaths at a normal level

Essentially no community flu just now

Death certificates, 438 (4.4%) mentioned novel coronavirus (COVID-19)

COVID deaths up by 117 since last week when it was 3.2% of all deaths

UK as a whole, deaths

Total deaths = 11,359, which was 197 deaths higher than the five-year average but 85 fewer than Week 40

Cases, 10th to 16th  October 2020

Infections continue to increase, England and Wales

Increased infection rates in all age groups

Highest in older teenagers and young adults.

One in 20 people likely to suffer from ‘Long COVID’, but who are they?

https://covid.joinzoe.com/post/long-covid

https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/08/long-haulers-covid-19-recognition-support-groups-symptoms/615382/

Symptoms were not serious enough to land them in hospital yet have persisted for many weeks or months

Hospitalised patients recognised to have lasting dyspnoea and fatigue in particular 

Latest analysis of data

N = 4,182 users of the COVID Symptom Study app

Symptom Study app users, consistently logging their health, and positive by swab PCR testing

https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.19.20214494v1

One in 20 people, symptoms lasting more than 8 weeks

How to predict long COVID

Symptoms

Age

Gender

BMI

Comorbidities

Accurately predict level of risk of developing long-term symptoms

Eleven days or less

Most people reported being back to normal

Symptoms lasting for at least 4 weeks

One in seven (13.3%, 558 users) 4 weeks

(14.5%)

Staying ill for 8 weeks

One in 20 (4.5%, 189 users) staying ill for 8 weeks

(51%)

Suffering for longer than 12 weeks

One in fifty (2.3%, 95 users)

(2.2%) 

Who is most likely to get long COVID?

Age (strongest predictor)

Older people are much more likely than younger people

Does occur across all ages

Around 10% of 18 - 49 year olds

Around 22% of over 70s

Symptoms (second predictor)

More different symptoms in first week (16.3%)

More than 5 symptoms, OR, 3.95

Fatigue OR=2.83

Headache, OR=2.62

Dyspnoea OR=2.36

Hoarse voice OR=2.33

Myalgia OR=2.22

Symptoms aged over 70

Loss of smell was the most predictive, OR=7.35

Fever OR=5.51

Hoarse voice OR=4.03

BMI (third predictor, 10.8%)

Slightly higher average BMI

M/F (3.7%)

Men are more likely to be admitted to hospital

Women slightly more likely to suffer from long COVID

Men 9.5%

Women 14.5%

Comorbidities

Asthma

No clear links to any other underlying health conditions.

Long COVID symptoms

Fell into two broad groups

Group 1

Dominated by respiratory symptoms, cough, shortness of breath

Fatigue and headaches

Group 2

Multi-system

Affecting many parts of the body, brain, gut and heart 

Palpitations

Fast heartbeat

Pins and needles or numbness

Problems concentrating (‘brain fog’)

People who experienced a wide range of symptoms across many body systems were more likely to need a hospital assessment

People with long COVID with recurrence of symptoms

16%

People with short COVID with recurrence of symptoms

8.4%

Predicting who will get long COVID

Model able to identify 69% of people who went on to get Long-Covid

i.e. predictive model has 69% sensitivity

Model was 73 % effective in avoiding false alarms

i.e. predicative model was 73% specific

Data checked with an independent dataset of 2,475 with positive coronavirus antibody test, similar results

App will give probability

Help target early interventions and research

Poorly-understood phenomenon.

The scale of the problem

Dr Claire Steves, King’s College

It’s important we use the knowledge we have gained from the first wave in the pandemic to reduce the long-term impact of the second

Thanks to the diligent logging of our contributors so far, this research could already pave the way for preventative and treatment strategies to reduce the long term effects

Using the app daily can help affected people and their doctors better categorise and judge their risks of developing longer more severe disease

We urge everyone to join the effort by downloading and sharing the app and taking just a minute every day to log your health
  
Tim Spector

COVID -19 is a mild illness for many

but for over one in 50 people symptoms can persist for longer than 12 weeks

So it’s important that, as well as worrying about excess deaths, we also need to consider those who will be affected by long COVID …

if we don’t get the pandemic under control soon

Having such large numbers of people affected means specialist services need to be set up urgently with the full financial help for hospitals and GPs

As we wait for a vaccine, it is vital that we all work together to stem the spread of coronavirus …

via lifestyle changes and more rigorous self isolating with symptoms or positive tests


Review of comorbidities in acute COVID

Obesity (body mass index ≥ 30 kg/m2)

Chronic kidney disease

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

Immunocompromised state due to solid organ transplant

Serious heart conditions (e.g. heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies)
