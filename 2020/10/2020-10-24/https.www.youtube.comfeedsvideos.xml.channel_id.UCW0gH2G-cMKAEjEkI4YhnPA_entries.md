Gandalf is known for his many travels far and wide in Middle-earth.  Today, we cover all of the known journeys of the great wizard.  From his dwelling in Aman during the first and second ages to his deeds in overthrowing Sauron and return to the Undying Lands, we will see where Gandalf goes, and explain why.

Unlike Saruman, Gandalf never sets down roots, preferring to travel far and wide in his efforts to fight Sauron. Whether you call him Mithrandir, Tharkûn, or Gandalf, you'll enjoy seeing every one of his journey's during his centuries in Middle-earth.
