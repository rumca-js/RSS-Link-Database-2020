Mario Kart Live brings racing into your living room, making your home--and your pets--an obstacles to overcome. So how does it fare against two cats in a studio apartment?

Mario Kart Live for Nintendo Switch lives up to its name, bringing Mario Kart into reality with its remote control Mario Kart that you can race through your own customizable courses. Everyone's living situation will make for their own unique obstacles and hurdles to overcome depending on the shape and size of the room you're playing in.

For Kurt Indovina, his studio apartment isn't the only obstacle he has to maneuver—he also has two cats. In this video, Kurt builds a course in his apartment and puts it to the test while trying to also dodge and steer around Mario's new towering foes: his two cats named Megatron and Lili. 

Controlling the kart with the Nintendo Switch, Kurt gets to see his living room, and cats, from a point of view like he’s never seen before thanks to the camera attached to the remote control Mario Kart. How will the cats fare against Mario as he zips around the floors of Kurt's humble abode?

Don't worry, no cats were harmed while making this video. Kurt loves them far too much.

When you dive deep into the vast fiction of the Cyberpunk universe, you find some weird stuff. For example, there's a gang of evil killer clowns and a group that cosplays as Star Trek characters. Wild! In this episode of GameSpot’s Cyberpunk Lore series, we’re delving into the weirder side of the fiction and talking about the strangest street gangs to ever roam Night City.

From a collective of street performers, to people that run around dressed like Jack the Ripper, there are all sorts of bizarre groups you can encounter in the original pen and paper RPG. Will any of these gangs show up in the upcoming Cyberpunk 2077? It seems unlikely, but we're holding onto  hope that CD Projekt Red has a few surprises left in store for us. Plus, they'd be pretty fun to see in-game.

With only three weeks to go, Lucy James, Tamoor Hussain, and Jordan Ramée discuss the new PlayStation Store and the rewards being added to PlayStation 5 Trophies, and they're joined by Michael Higham to answer even more of your Xbox Series X questions.

The new consoles are almost here and both Sony and Microsoft are preparing for their arrival. What does this mean? For the former it means making some tweaks to the way its existing services work in order for the transition to PlayStation 5 to be a little more smooth. For the latter it means dishing out new information on the ways Xbox Series X/S owners will be able to make the most of their brand new hardware.

On this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor tackle the aforementioned tweaks Sony is making. More specifically, they talk about the changes to the PlayStation Store, which has been redesigned somewhat. Tune in to find out what's new, what's changed, what's gone, and what it all means. There's also a quick analysis of what the future could hold for PlayStation's Trophies, which look like they may start dishing out rewards in a different way.

For the Xbox part of the discussion, techspert Michael Higham returns to answer some of your burning questions about the X/S. These range from whether you can run apps off an external hard drive and whether the hard drive that Microsoft endorsed as made for the Xbox Series X works with the new consoles, to Kinect 2 compatibility and how new platforms will work with setting a home console.

Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.

## The History Of Pikmin

Pikmin isn't as recognizable as Mario or Zelda, but it's certainly one of Nintendo's most unique franchises. With Pikmin 3 Deluxe right around the corner, we thought now would be a good time to take an expedition through the history of Pikmin.

The brainchild of Shigeru Miyamoto, Pikmin tasks you with growing and managing little vegetable creatures who aid you in battle, help solve puzzles, and collect treasure for you. In one game you only have 30 days to live, and in another you have to gather food for your home planet, but usually you end up crash landing no matter the circumstances. Pikmin first released on the Nintendo GameCube in 2001 and has grown from there.

Pikmin has only had three mainline entries so far, aptly named Pikmin, Pikmin 2, and Pikmin 3, but the franchise isn’t limited to just those three games. There’s a 3DS spin-off titled Hey! Pikmin, as well as a series of Pikmin Short Movies on YouTube, while  series mainstay Captain Olimar has appeared in multiple Super Smash Bros. entries. There’s also a possible Pikmin 4 on the way, with Miyamoto confirming its existence twice. 

Pikmin 3 Deluxe, an enhanced port of the original Pikmin 3 on Wii U, is headed to Nintendo Switch with a new prologue and epilogue along with other additions like new difficulty modes and the Piklopedia. Pikmin 3 Deluxe will release on October 30, 2020.
