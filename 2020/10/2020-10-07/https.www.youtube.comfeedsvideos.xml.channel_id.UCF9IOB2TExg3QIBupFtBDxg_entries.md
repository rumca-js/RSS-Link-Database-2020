Delirium, a new clinical feature (5th October)

A key sign in frail, older people

N = 322 patients admitted to hospital

N = 535 users of the COVID Symptom Study app who tested positive

A state of acute confusion

Associated with a higher risk of serious illness and death

Be aware of delirium as a possible early warning sign in the elderly

Delirium, tiredness, breathlessness, more common in frailer people

A third experiencing delirium lacked ‘classic’ COVID-19 symptoms of cough and fever

For 18.9 % delirium was the only symptom

Dr Rose Penfold

Watch out for any changes in mental state in elderly people

Confusion or strange behaviour

Could be an early sign of coronavirus infection

Put in place infection control measures such as isolation

Increased hygiene and personal protective equipment

Log health reports on behalf of friends and family who aren’t able to access the app

Significantly increased the number of older people in the study

Great Barrington Declaration

https://gbdeclaration.org

Berkshire County, Massachusetts

Grave concerns 

Damaging physical and mental health impacts of prevailing policies

Recommend Focused Protection 

Current lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health

Lower childhood vaccination rates

Worsening cardiovascular disease outcomes

Fewer cancer screenings

Deteriorating mental health

Leading to greater excess mortality in years to come

Working class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden

Keeping students out of school is a grave injustice

Irreparable damage

Underprivileged disproportionately harmed

Vulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young

For children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than influenza 

As immunity builds in the population

Risk of infection to all falls

All populations will eventually reach herd immunity

The point at which the rate of new infections is stable

This can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine

Our goal, minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity

Allow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally

Build up immunity to the virus through natural infection

While better protecting those who are at highest risk

We call this Focused Protection 

For example

Nursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity

Frequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors

Staff rotation should be minimized

Retired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home

Meet family members outside rather than inside

A comprehensive and detailed list of measures, is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals

Those who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal

Simple hygiene measures, and staying home when sick to reduce the herd immunity threshold

Schools and universities should be open for in-person teaching

Extracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed

Young low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home

Restaurants and other businesses should open

Arts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume

People who are more at risk may participate if they wish

FDA, vaccine approval

https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download

At least half or participants must be flowed up for 2 months after their second dose

These recommendations are specific to COVID-19 vaccines, which are complex biological products that are intended to be administered to millions of individuals, including healthy people, to prevent disease. 

Data from Phase 3 studies should include a median follow-up duration of at least two months after completion of the full vaccination regimen to help provide adequate information to assess a vaccine’s benefit-risk profile, 

WHO

https://vaccine-safety-training.org/vaccine-reactions.html

There is low public tolerance of vaccine adverse reactions. Vaccines are therefore only licensed when the frequency of severe reactions is very rare and when only minor, self-limiting reactions are reported
