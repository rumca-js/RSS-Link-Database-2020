It's pretty amazing that computers work at all. The notion that we've created these incredibly reliable inter-connected web of low-cost machines is beyond what science fiction could have even imagined just 30 years ago. Many are considering upgrading to fiber internet—with 1Gbps speeds in both directions—however we've upgraded to 10 Gigabit internet which is some of the fastest small-business/residential internet speeds in the United States. The problem is that even with the wold's fastest internet, there are still frequently slowdowns dependent on the task. That's because total bandwidth is just one small piece of the pie. Throughput is determined by lots of factors like latency, routers and switching, infrastructure cabling, caching, and more. Let's talk about them all today.
