In this first episode of "Louder Than A Riot," a mysterious conspiracy letter sends us on a journey to find out just how entangled hip-hop and mass incarceration have become over the last 40 years. 

In 2012, an unsigned letter began circulating on popular hip-hop blogs, describing a meeting that allegedly happened 20 years earlier between private prison and music industry executives. According to this letter, record execs were asked to begin marketing and promoting hip-hop that glorified criminal behavior in exchange for stock in the prison business. What does this conspiracy theory suggest about the relationship between hip-hop and America's prison system? 

In this episode, we examine the history of policing and the music industry's complicity with hip-hop OGs Too Short and Killer Mike, break down iconic songs like "The Message" and "6 'N the Mornin'," flip through the pages of The Source's Behind Bars issue with former editor-in-chief Kim Osorio and go inside the mind of retired NYPD "hip-hop cop" Derrick Parker. All this to unveil how the justice system disproportionately affects Black America, and what hip-hop, as America's most consumed music genre, has always done to push back.

WHAT'S "LOUDER THAN A RIOT"?
Rhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. "Louder Than A Riot" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles — the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Bob Boilen | October 7, 2020
Angel Olsen is sitting on the porch of her new Asheville, N.C., home singing "Whole New Mess." She wrote it long before she bought this house. The song is actually about addictions, defining her "home" amidst a life of touring that kept her on the road for large chunks of time. Much like this Tiny Desk performance, the original recording is just her stunning voice and guitar (minus the birds and the trees), recorded in a church-turned-studio a few years ago.

Angel Olsen also plays "Iota," a song that wishes "that all the world could see something for what it is at the same time." I've always thought of this as a hopeful song, and hearing it a half-dozen years after its release, the hope feels beyond her reach; nevertheless, for the handful of minutes she's singing, I feel comforted. Angel leaves us with "Waving, Smiling," a farewell song. She says goodbye to the sounds around her, the birds, the chainsaws, and leaves us with a theme of acceptance, bittersweet but without regret.
