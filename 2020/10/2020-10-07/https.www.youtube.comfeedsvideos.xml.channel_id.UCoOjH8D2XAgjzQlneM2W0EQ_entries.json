One of only four companies in the entire world that specializes in Cryonics. For an affordable price $50/mo + life insurance, Alcor will have a medical team for you on standby. Once the day arrives when you\u2019re pronounced dead, they\u2019ll rush a team out to your body, and then rush your body back to their facility where they\u2019ll \u201cfreeze\u201d your body to cool. They\u2019ll keep your body there until hopefully one day, we\u2019ll be able to revive you back to life. \n\nBefore Sept 2013, the field of aging and life extension was pretty pathetic. But a man named Bill Marris was about to change that stigma. He pitched the idea for a startup aimed at curing aging to the Google co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin and they loved it. \n\nOn Sept 18, 2013, Google\u2019s mysterious new company called Calico launched in an effort to manufacture something that Silicon Valley has never been able to make: time. And this new movement has led to some remarkable advancements in recent years, including the rise of one Professor by the name of David Sinclair. \n\nAs time goes by, your DNA gets naturally damaged from things like UV light, so your cells have to repair your DNA and epigenome. Sinclair has been able to figure out ways to slow down the damage to your epigenome, and thus, slow down aging. We\u2019re able to reverse aging all together for a group of cells. He\u2019s working on how to reverse the age of the entire body. David Sinclair has been featured on Joe Rogan, Veratasium, etc.\n\nThen there\u2019s Neuralink from Elon Musk. Instead of curing aging head on or freezing you after you die, Neuralink\u2019s goal is to work around your existing body. That\u2019s where their brain machine interface comes in - a computer chip that wires directly to your brain. Neuralink\u2019s goal is to not only read these signals, but to also send the right signals to your brain to counteract things like memory loss, hearing loss, blindness, paralysis, depression, strokes, and more.\n\nSolving immortality? \u201cThe world has witnessed big plays before, but what was bigger than death?\u201d \u201cWhen forever comes, will we be able to survive it?\u201d \n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
