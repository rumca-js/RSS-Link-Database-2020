<p>Rishi Sunak could have designed better pandemic policies but Tesco could have refused freebie </p><p>Back in April, Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis played it cute. The £635m final dividend for shareholders related to the supermarket’s pre-pandemic performance in 2019, he said, so please don’t call it a taxpayer-funded windfall courtesy of Rishi Sunak’s business rates giveaway for retailers. The rates relief would eventually be worth £585m to Tesco, but mostly in the next financial year.</p><p>New boss Ken Murphy has no such excuse. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/07/tesco-hit-by-533m-covid-costs-but-sales-jump-during-pandemic">Tesco’s latest £315m divi</a> relates to a six-month period in which £249m of relief was actually felt in reported profits.

<p>Clubs playing to empty stands are in grave financial peril and the government appears oblivious to dangers beyond the Premier League spotlight</p><p>Sport has become a touchstone during the pandemic. Whether the continuation or otherwise of sports the British hold dear deserves to assume so central a place is another matter.

But from the government’s wish that televised football recommence to <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-premier-league-return-would-lift-the-spirits-of-the-nation-dominic-raab-says-11983689" title="">boost</a> the nation’s spirits, to the fraught discussion of which clubs and leagues will survive, the question of sport’s future has been inescapable.</p><p>The government has, as in most areas, managed to achieve the worst of all worlds.

<p>It no longer matters why your friend isn’t there for you, writes advice columnist Eleanor Gordon-Smith. Dwelling on the reasons will lead to more hurt</p><p><strong>I have known my closest friend for 25 years. We had children at the same time which brought us closer, and I would see her at least once a week. The children are older, we both have busy jobs, but I have not seen her for a year and her replies to my message are becoming less frequent. I think I’m being ghosted.</strong></p><p><strong>I am guessing why this might be the case. I do not live close enough and she has a big group of lifelong friends – that I’m outside of – who do live nearby. Also I’ve been addressing codependency in my family, which may highlight hers. I’ve heard less from her since a close relative of mine died. She didn’t seem to want to go through that with me, or didn’t understand that I was grieving. I felt very let down.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/08/i-think-im-being-ghosted-by-my-closest-friend-how-do-i-move-on-with-my-dignity-intact">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The PM’s conference speech ranged from wind power to social care. Without clear targets, how can we measure his success?</p><p>Boris Johnson is a Marmite politician, so it is no surprise that his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/06/what-did-boris-johnsons-conference-speech-really-mean">Conservative conference speech</a> has provoked radically different responses. Those on the right who can only ever see Johnson’s strengths – as vote winner, optimist or charismatic leader – heard only the speech’s virtues and ignored its many weaknesses. Those on the left who see only Johnson’s vices heard the exact opposite – the speech’s narcissism, vagueness and at times nastiness – not its larger potential significance.</p><p>There was more to Johnson’s speech than this. Perhaps that is because, in a Covid-dominated virtual conference season, the text of a leader’s speech looms larger than the theatrical performance. That has rarely been the case with Johnson, where the performance is normally all. This time, however, his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/06/johnson-does-the-tory-conference-shuffle-but-misses-his-audience">speech</a> contained a lot of clues about his government’s intended direction – while highlighting the problems it will encounter in trying to stick to it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/07/johnson-britain-future-results-conference-speech">Continue reading...</a>

Virtuoso guitarist with Van Halen, the US hard rock band known for their flamboyant stage performances<p>The death of Eddie Van Halen from throat cancer, aged 65, brings to a close one of the most colourful and lucrative sagas in American rock music. If Aerosmith was the premier US hard rock band of the 1970s, it was Van Halen who stepped into their shoes during the 80s. Formed around the Van Halen brothers, the guitarist Eddie and the drummer Alex, the band rode a tidal wave of multi-platinum albums over a 15-year period. Few other acts have come close to matching their commercially combustible mixture of spectacular and addictive rock, flamboyant stage performances and outsized personal behaviour.</p><p>The band sold more than 80m albums worldwide. Eleven of their studio albums reached the US Top 10, and four reached No 1. In 2012, Van Halen was ranked top of Guitar World magazine’s list of 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/07/eddie-van-halen-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The England manager has picked an inexperienced 30-man squad for the international triple-header. What will he learn? </p><p>In football, as in life, timing is everything. It is certainly no fault of Gareth Southgate’s that his England side must now take centre stage with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/05/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">last weekend’s riotously entertaining</a> Premier League still fresh in the memory. Hurrah for international triple-header week, said no one ever; and yet the stakes for these three fixtures at a deserted Wembley – a friendly against Wales on Thursday, followed by Nations League games against Belgium on Sunday and Denmark on Wednesday – are considerable. Not simply for this emerging, amorphous England team, but for Southgate himself.</p><p>Outside major tournaments, the lot of the international manager is one of basic helplessness in the face of events. The player you fall in love with one game could get catastrophically injured before the next. The red-hot striker who was banging them in before Christmas might be enfeebled and exhausted by March. So little of your success is actually within your control, and yet even by those standards Southgate’s last 12 months have been a chastening lesson in just how quickly the mood music can shift.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/07/gareth-southgate-needs-to-find-solutions-for-unbalanced-england-side">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alex Gibney’s eye-opening documentary, made in secret, assembles a damning, if frustratingly incomplete, timeline of a government ill-equipped to deal with a deadly pandemic</p><p>Making a documentary that endeavors to tell the story of the coronavirus pandemic presents a litany of unique inherent challenges. To wit: the preponderance of misinformation swirling around the topic, a scope that encompasses every country on the face of the earth, the difficulty of shooting without infecting the crew or interview subjects, a breadth of crisis felt at both the highest institutional and most intimately personal levels, and the fact that no one knows whether we’re nearing the end, at some phase of the middle, or still working through the beginning. Alex Gibney, Ophelia Harutyunyan and Suzanne Hillinger’s new film Totally Under Control sneaks in a title card stating that Donald Trump announced his positive Covid-19 test the day after the production team called a wrap on editing. By the time it gets released online next week, several major developments may have already transpired. A glaring incompleteness could not be avoided – unless, of course, the directors had waited to roll cameras until some new status quo had been reached.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/aug/21/coronation-review-ai-weiwei-harrowing-coronavirus-documentary">Coronation review – Ai Weiwei's harrowing coronavirus documentary</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/07/totally-under-control-review-shocking-film-on-trumps-failure-to-handle-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cricket was not always so precious when it came to bowlers running out batsmen for backing up too far<br /></p><p>To Dubai, and Ravi Ashwin’s ongoing escapades for the Delhi Capitals. Over the past few months Ashwin has been running something of a one-man campaign to legitimise cricket’s most nefarious means of dismissal, the Mankad. Which, if you need a gloss, is when the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8BPWlyfBmI">bowler runs out the batsman</a> as he’s backing up at the non-striker’s end. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/mar/25/ashwin-mankad-buttler-kings-xi-ipl-cricket">Ashwin did it to Jos Buttler</a> last season. “Disgraceful‚” said Shane Warne. “Completely out of order‚” said Michael Vaughan.</p><p>Ashwin was unapologetic. This year he has being coached by Ricky Ponting, who warned “we won’t be doing that”. Instead, Ponting said, he wanted Ashwin to “hold on to the ball and “tell the batsman to stay in his crease”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/oct/07/the-mankad-was-acceptable-once-so-why-does-ashwin-get-so-much-grief-ipl-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

Aged eight, she’d taken on some work for her family’s video rental store in Wolverhampton. “And it wasn’t until years later when I was talking about my past with a friend, that I thought: ‘Oh my god, I used to do the piracy, that was <em>me</em>! I was the chief pirate officer!’”</p><p>It’s a tale she recounts in her charming short film <a href="http://www.nae.org.uk/exhibition/jambo-cinema/171">Jambo Cinema</a> (co-directed with Anthony Davies), which tells the story of her parents emigrating to the UK from the Punjab in India (via Kenya) and setting up shop in Wolverhampton – first an electrical store, then adding Bollywood rentals to the mix. In 10 minutes the film manages to cover immigration, Thatcherism, grief and much more. And it’s also honest enough to confess to some of her dad’s more, shall we say, Del Boyish leanings – struggling to turn a profit from his rentals, he asked his two daughters to sit at home and watch the films while recording them on several VHS machines at once.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/07/jambo-cinema-dawinder-bansal-video-shop-london-film-festival-short-film">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘Many Inuit villages don’t have running water so most homes have a steam house. They go in and just sweat it out’</p><p>This was taken in Quinhagak, Alaska, in 2015. I was documenting daily Inuit life. The idea was to travel from Quinhagak, on the south-western coast, to Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow) way up in the north, then across to the Canadian border in the east. I’m from Alaska and have been working as a photographer across the state since I was 20. I had a bank of images in my mind I knew had never been shot. I had never seen, for example, a contemporary photograph of Alaskans in a steam house. But I didn’t expect to get a shot of three men sitting in one right off the bat.</p><p>When I walked past, I just waved. They said, “Hey!” and I kept walking. I thought there was no way they were going to say yes to a photo. But I realised if I didn’t go back and ask, I would regret it for the rest of my life. And they said: “Yeah, go ahead.” The men – from left, Robert White, William Sharp and John Sharp – were laughing, but I was mostly in shock, since they were so cool with it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/07/brian-adams-best-photograph-inuit-steam-house-alaska">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Savvas&nbsp;Kourepinis is the captain of the Astral, a humanitarian boat patrolling the Mediterranean Sea to rescue people attempting to cross the main maritime route from north Africa to Europe. For most of this year, the Covid-19 pandemic forced these vital search-and-rescue missions to cease in what is often referred to as the deadliest migration route in the world. As Kourepinis and his crew set out on one of their first patrols since lockdown restrictions eased, they face stringent coronavirus regulations and the reluctance of nearby countries to take in the people the Astral has rescued</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/oct/07/the-captain-rescuing-migrants-in-the-mediterranean-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-video">Continue reading...</a>

But with rental scheme trials taking place across the country, could they be answer to getting to work in the pandemic? </p><p>Standing upright, you glide, ghostlike, along the street. You have no emissions. You are alone, outside, unlikely to catch anything or pass anything on. You are no burden to the public transport system, nor do you contribute much to congestion.

<p>You don’t have to stop at dessert – chocolate can enhance so many dishes, whether sweet, savoury, spicy or all three</p><p>My dad, distressingly, does not like chocolate. Actually, that is not true. He likes chocolate, but not chocolate <em>in</em> stuff. He won’t touch <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/09/anna-jones-chocolate-cake-recipes">chocolate cake</a>, he shuns chocolate mousses, and he is actively repulsed by chocolate ice-cream. It is a perplexing trait, considering I love the stuff (he has refused to take a paternity test). My bafflement has prompted me to find as many ways as possible of hiding chocolate in dishes, in the hope that he will be able to stomach one of them.</p><p>The most important thing to note before commencing is that, with few exceptions, these recipes call for dark chocolate – 70% cocoa solids or up. If you were to, say, lob a Galaxy bar into your dinner, you would end up with a sickly, too-sweet mess. With that out of the way, let’s start with mole. The Mexican chilli sauce is so overwhelming – coming in waves of smokiness, bitterness and sweetness – that chocolate haters will be too confused to identify all the ingredients. David Lebovitz has <a href="https://www.davidlebovitz.com/a-frugal-gourme/">a recipe for chicken with mole</a> that isn’t very chocolatey at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/07/cocoa-nutty-17-surprising-chocolate-recipes-from-mole-to-tagliatelle-al-cioccolato">Continue reading...</a>

One reads “fuck” and the other “negativity”. “That is how to start the morning with a smile on your face,” she says. Then she will make breakfast to tango music. Sometimes, she will retreat to a hut in the woods by her house in upstate New York, for six days with no food, to contemplate a giant crystal she keeps there and “connect with the memory of the planet”.</p><p>This delicious glimpse into the life of the world’s most famous performance artist comes from a new documentary for <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007ght1/episodes/guide">BBC One’s </a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007ght1/episodes/guide">Imagine series</a>. “I think it’s important to demystify the idea of this glamorous life. It’s just down to earth,” she tells me, completely seriously, of the film – even though her house, built in the shape of a star, is filled with amazing furniture and art, and the grounds are vast enough to hold an aircraft hangar-sized shed containing her archive. It’s all fabulous – as is Abramović, who is funny, warm and yet somehow otherworldly (she goes in for shamanism, crystals, clairvoyants and star signs). I concede there are down-to-earth elements – when we speak via Zoom, for example, she is drinking a mug of Yorkshire Gold tea, discovered through a Welsh friend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/07/marina-abramovic-im-an-artist-not-a-satanist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A Ramblers and MoD initiative allows UK walkers to safely access areas rich in wildlife and scenery. Here are six, starting with one near Edinburgh<br /></p><p>A path through the woods passes a monument to CTR Wilson, a Nobel prize-winning physicist, and meteorologist, born in the nearby village of Glencorse. Wilson invented the cloud chamber and, as I take the gorse-lined trail that heads towards the cloud-cloaked summit of Castlelaw Hill, I can’t help feeling envious of the surroundings in which he grew up.</p><p>The Pentland Hills, south-west of Edinburgh, are swathed in a muted wash of autumnal heather and afford a view over the steely L-shaped waters of Glencorse reservoir. So far, so gently rugged and tranquil, but there’s a sign ahead that warns of impending dangers: “Military Range Keep Out When Red Flags Flying; Warning Troops Training; Danger. Do not touch any Military debris - it may explode or harm you.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/oct/07/great-uk-walking-trails-ministry-of-defence-land-ramblers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How does it feel to be backstabbed? Do they still get shouted at in the street? Are the jobs fake? And does Lord Sugar need to use a booster seat? Past winners and losers relive their traumas and triumphs</p><p><strong>‘My tactics were to play the fool’<br /></strong><em><a href="https://twitter.com/simonambrose?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Simon Ambrose</a>, winner of series 3</em></p><p>I was made to look a bit of an idiot on the show, but that was a tactic for me. I tried to pass myself off as less intelligent than I was – it was good for other contestants to underestimate you. Before filming, I spent a lot of time memorising stuff about Lord Sugar’s businesses, but I never told anyone that. I played the fool, always willing to do silly things, such as rap or dance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/07/won-lost-outed-national-press-lord--apprentice-survivors-reveal-all">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Illegal dumping increased 300% during lockdown, causing fury and upset everywhere from animal shelters to pretty villages. Now some people are taking matters into their own hands</p><p>The TV comes over the garden wall first, in a graceful arc, rolling twice before coming to a stop, the screen miraculously unsmashed. Next come a tyre, a door frame, a drawer, miscellaneous pieces of wood and bits of hoarding.</p><p>A young woman appears, voice raised in anger. “What are you doing?” she asks, filming events on a mobile phone. “I’m the owner of the land,” responds Clifford Hamilton, who is flinging rubbish into her garden with the aid of two workmen. She steps away and calls the police as more rubbish – a door, planks of wood, what looks to be part of a kitchen cabinet – sails over the wall. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/07/one-guy-pulled-a-crowbar-on-me-why-fly-tipping-wars-are-raging-across-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Swedish example is regularly raised by libertarian-minded Conservatives when protesting against government restrictions aimed at quelling the spread of the virus in the UK. But what did the Scandinavian country do differently and could it be applied elsewhere?</p><p>When politicians across the world were confronted with the reality of a spreading pandemic, hospitals nearing capacity and deaths rising almost all of them reached for emergency legislation to enforce lockdowns, curfews and other bans on social gatherings. But Sweden chose a markedly different approach. </p><p>The Guardian’s Europe correspondent <strong>Jon Henley </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>how in Sweden, the government vested its pandemic response in its unelected public health expert Anders Tegnell, who issued advice and guidance rather than strict lockdowns. It was highly controversial because of catastrophic failures in its care homes: deaths rose rapidly, far outstripping those recorded in neighbouring countries. But as much of Europe appears to be experiencing a second wave of Covid infections, in Sweden cases are not rising so rapidly. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/oct/07/does-sweden-have-the-answer-to-living-with-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>
