Will the pandemic finally defeat her? </p><p>Every morning, Marina Abramovi\u0107 gets out of bed and puts on a <a href=\"http://www.coryarcangel.com/things-i-made/2015-164-fuck-negativity-slides-srf-032\">pair of slippers</a>. One reads \u201cfuck\u201d and the other \u201cnegativity\u201d. \u201cThat is how to start the morning with a smile on your face,\u201d she says. Then she will make breakfast to tango music. Sometimes, she will retreat to a hut in the woods by her house in upstate New York, for six days with no food, to contemplate a giant crystal she keeps there and \u201cconnect with the memory of the planet\u201d.</p><p>This delicious glimpse into the life of the world\u2019s most famous performance artist comes from a new documentary for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007ght1/episodes/guide\">BBC One\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007ght1/episodes/guide\">Imagine series</a>. \u201cI think it\u2019s important to demystify the idea of this glamorous life. It\u2019s just down to earth,\u201d she tells me, completely seriously, of the film \u2013 even though her house, built in the shape of a star, is filled with amazing furniture and art, and the grounds are vast enough to hold an aircraft hangar-sized shed containing her archive. It\u2019s all fabulous \u2013 as is Abramovi\u0107, who is funny, warm and yet somehow otherworldly (she goes in for shamanism, crystals, clairvoyants and star signs). I concede there are down-to-earth elements \u2013 when we speak via Zoom, for example, she is drinking a mug of Yorkshire Gold tea, discovered through a Welsh friend.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/07/marina-abramovic-im-an-artist-not-a-satanist\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/07/marina-abramovic-im-an-artist-not-a-satanist", "date_published": "2020-10-07 09:00:34+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Carbon capture 'moonshot' moves closer, as billions of dollars pour in", "description": "<p>While some say CO2 capture is part of the problem, big projects are being invested in as a part solution to the climate crisis<br /></p><ul><li> Support Guardian journalism today, by making a <a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/contribute?acquisitionData=%7B%22source%22%3A%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%2C%22componentType%22%3A%22ACQUISITIONS_EDITORIAL_LINK%22%2C%22campaignCode%22%3A%22climate_pledge_2019%22%2C%22componentId%22%3A%22climate_pledge_2019%22%2C%22referrerPageviewId%22%3A%22kfwk8r12her1nuw8kdfu%22%2C%22referrerUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2020%2Foct%2F05%2F3000-articles-100m-readers-a-year-of-our-best-environment-journalism%22%7D&amp;INTCMP=climate_pledge_2019\">single or recurring contribution</a>, or <a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/digital?acquisitionData=%7B%22source%22%3A%22GUARDIAN_WEB%22%2C%22componentType%22%3A%22ACQUISITIONS_EDITORIAL_LINK%22%2C%22campaignCode%22%3A%22climate_pledge_2019%22%2C%22componentId%22%3A%22climate_pledge_2019%22%2C%22referrerPageviewId%22%3A%22kfwk8r12her1nuw8kdfu%22%2C%22referrerUrl%22%3A%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fenvironment%2F2020%2Foct%2F05%2F3000-articles-100m-readers-a-year-of-our-best-environment-journalism%22%7D&amp;INTCMP=climate_pledge_2019\">subscribing</a></li></ul><p>As the world dices with the climate emergency, businesses and governments are starting to push funding towards technology that aims to trap planet-heating gases rather than let them saturate the atmosphere.</p><p>Carbon capture is a controversial idea, attacked as a costly distraction from stopping emissions occurring in the first place.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/07/carbon-capture-moonshot-moves-closer-as-billions-of-dollars-pour-in\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/07/carbon-capture-moonshot-moves-closer-as-billions-of-dollars-pour-in", "date_published": "2020-10-07 08:19:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Posters that changed the world \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>Poster designs have long influenced our lives \u2013 from anti-slavery messages and sexual health awareness campaigns to political elections and film promotions.
