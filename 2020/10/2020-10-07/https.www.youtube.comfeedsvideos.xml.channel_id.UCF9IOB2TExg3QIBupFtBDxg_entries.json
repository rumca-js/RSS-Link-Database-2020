Declaration\n\nhttps://gbdeclaration.org\n\nBerkshire County, Massachusetts\n\nGrave concerns \n\nDamaging physical and mental health impacts of prevailing policies\n\nRecommend Focused Protection \n\nCurrent lockdown policies are producing devastating effects on short and long-term public health\n\nLower childhood vaccination rates\n\nWorsening cardiovascular disease outcomes\n\nFewer cancer screenings\n\nDeteriorating mental health\n\nLeading to greater excess mortality in years to come\n\nWorking class and younger members of society carrying the heaviest burden\n\nKeeping students out of school is a grave injustice\n\nIrreparable damage\n\nUnderprivileged disproportionately harmed\n\nVulnerability to death from COVID-19 is more than a thousand-fold higher in the old and infirm than the young\n\nFor children, COVID-19 is less dangerous than influenza \n\nAs immunity builds in the population\n\nRisk of infection to all falls\n\nAll populations will eventually reach herd immunity\n\nThe point at which the rate of new infections is stable\n\nThis can be assisted by (but is not dependent upon) a vaccine\n\nOur goal, minimize mortality and social harm until we reach herd immunity\n\nAllow those who are at minimal risk of death to live their lives normally\n\nBuild up immunity to the virus through natural infection\n\nWhile better protecting those who are at highest risk\n\nWe call this Focused Protection \n\nFor example\n\nNursing homes should use staff with acquired immunity\n\nFrequent PCR testing of other staff and all visitors\n\nStaff rotation should be minimized\n\nRetired people living at home should have groceries and other essentials delivered to their home\n\nMeet family members outside rather than inside\n\nA comprehensive and detailed list of measures, is well within the scope and capability of public health professionals\n\nThose who are not vulnerable should immediately be allowed to resume life as normal\n\nSimple hygiene measures, and staying home when sick to reduce the herd immunity threshold\n\nSchools and universities should be open for in-person teaching\n\nExtracurricular activities, such as sports, should be resumed\n\nYoung low-risk adults should work normally, rather than from home\n\nRestaurants and other businesses should open\n\nArts, music, sport and other cultural activities should resume\n\nPeople who are more at risk may participate if they wish", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lSmSWx6kjA", "date_published": "2020-10-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"},
