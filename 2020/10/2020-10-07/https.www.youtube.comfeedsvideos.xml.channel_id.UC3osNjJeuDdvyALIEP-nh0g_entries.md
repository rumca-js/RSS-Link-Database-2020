See what being a part of a Script Club meeting is like.

What is Script Club?
Weekly video calls where we analyze screenplays to understand what works and what doesnâ€™t, and most importantly, what we can apply to our own writing. We've previously done A Quiet Place, Little Miss Sunshine, Chinatown and more.

What is the Behind the Curtain Membership?
To put it simply, it's: Learning from the experts. Growing with a community. 

I believe that it's so much easier to grow as a writer when you're surrounded by other writers that support and encourage you to learn.
