Tuesday, Oct. 6, at 6 p.m., we're going to air a performance recorded by Lucius during a MicroShow performance that took place under the rotunda of the Minnesota State Capitol building in March 2017. To accompany that broadcast highlight, here are three songs captured on video during that unforgettable performance. "Singing in a space where you feel your voice all around you," Holly Laessig of Lucius recalls, "that was an incredible space, acoustically, to just be in. … that was a pretty special performance."
Lucius's Jess Wolfe adds that it was "something that was special and unique. It was idyllic, really."
