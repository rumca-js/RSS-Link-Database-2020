His mission was to make knowledge accessible to many by combining entertainment and culture, with quality and fair prices. Prolific in the 1970s and 80s, Newton &amp; Compton was \u201cfamous\u201d for its paperbacks and large pocketbook editions, as well as a series of bestselling thrillers called <em>Superinsuperabili</em>, or super-unbeatable. Most interesting, though \u2013 and why I\u2019m writing this today \u2013 is its ongoing series <em><a href=\"https://www.newtoncompton.com/ricerca\">Tradizioni Italiane</a></em>, which brings together \u201cart, architecture, folklore, proverbs and idioms, culinary tradition, and history in a splendid, low-priced necklace\u201d. In the early 90s, as part of Tradizioni Italiane<em>,</em> Newton Compton Editori commissioned a series of regional cookbooks, each written by a local expert. The result was 27 fat volumes (Lazio, Tuscany, Campania, Emilia Romagna, Liguria and Piemonte each having two volumes) published between 1996 and 2003.</p><p>That period of publishing held a mirror up against a huge change for the whole of Italy; that is, the three-year transition period from January 1999 to 28 February 2002, when the Italian lira was phased out and the euro adopted. The transition meant a change for the project, which became a collaboration with a national newspaper that helped distribute the book, but which was also disruptive: the early books are priced in lira, the later ones in euros. Despite what must have been a tremulous period, the series was a successful, brilliant and detailed catalogue of Italian regional cooking, documenting its staggering breadth, diversity, common threads, and goodness.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/05/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-braised-chicken-with-pesto\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/05/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-braised-chicken-with-pesto", "date_published": "2020-10-05 10:00:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Amazon near tipping point of switching from rainforest to savannah \u2013 study", "description": "<p>Climate crisis and logging is leading to shift from canopy rainforest to open grassland<br /></p><p>Much of the Amazon could be on the verge of losing its distinct nature and switching from a closed canopy rainforest to an open savannah with far fewer trees as a result of the climate crisis, researchers have warned.</p><p>Rainforests are highly sensitive to changes in rainfall and moisture levels, and fires and prolonged droughts can result in areas losing trees and shifting to a savannah-like mix of woodland and grassland.
