Hello. Here is a downtempo performance on modular. A version of it appears on this album: 
https://soundvision.bandcamp.com/album/adams-fault

Orchestra samples from the Squarp Rample, with three channels of samples
cycling through 2 samples on each channel. The Rample is mixed into an A-138s stereo mixer, and then goes into the Solid State Fate stereo dipole filter. 

Pamela’s new workout is sending euclidian gates to the After Later Audio Piques, which is converting those to envelopes. Those envelopes are rhythmically modulating the dipole filter, which is audible when the stereo cutoff is set lower.

All of that is running into the Erica Synths DSP and after later audio monsoon for delay and reverb.

The MHI Varigate 8+ is sequencing the vpme.de Quad Drum: kick snare, and foley samples. The left out of the QD is split to dry and also to the Tiptop z5000 for fx. The right out of the QD is split to dry and to the QU-Bit Prism for fx. 

Both effects unit are being modulated by the Abstract Devices ADE-32. The bitcrushed sound fades in is the drums through Qu-Bit Prism, with modulation from Pam's and the ADE-32.

The small hihat is the Audio Damage Neuron set to noise only, modulating
the decay by hand. 

The long high synth sound is the Piston Honda wavetable module
sequenced by Hermod, with a low chance to play a note. It's envelope is generated by Quart. 

Rings and the Pico Voice are both making plucked string sounds. They’re set to ratchet and have a medium chance to occur, all using the effects within
the Hermod. Rings is being sent to the same effects unit as the samples.

Plaits is supposed to be doing a deep bass, but its connection to the mixer
was dodgy, and it only comes in a bit later.

The high arp synth is the Joranalogue Generate 3, hand modulating its phase
and its envelope, through Quart.

The Tetrapad is set to modulate the Rample pitch but I did not use
it all that much.

Everything not going through a eurorack effect unit is running into a mixer,
with an aux send to the Zoia. The Zoia is running a reverb and delay, but the input is high-passed so that only the high frequencies receive the effect which leaves my bass dry and centered.

By combining chance values in the Hermod, Euclidian modulation through
Pamela’s New Workout, and cycling uncertainty with the samples, we create a self-evolving tapestry of sound and form.
