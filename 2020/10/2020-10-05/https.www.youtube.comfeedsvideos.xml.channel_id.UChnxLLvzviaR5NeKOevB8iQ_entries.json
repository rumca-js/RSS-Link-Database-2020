Here is a downtempo performance on modular. A version of it appears on this album: \nhttps://soundvision.bandcamp.com/album/adams-fault\nhttps://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/jeremyblake/adams-fault\n\nOrchestra samples from the Squarp Rample, with three channels of samples\ncycling through 2 samples on each channel. The Rample is mixed into an A-138s stereo mixer, and then goes into the Solid State Fate stereo dipole filter. \n\nPamela\u2019s new workout is sending euclidian gates to the After Later Audio Piques, which is converting those to envelopes. Those envelopes are rhythmically modulating the dipole filter, which is audible when the stereo cutoff is set lower.\n\nAll of that is running into the Erica Synths DSP and after later audio monsoon for delay and reverb.\n\nThe MHI Varigate 8+ is sequencing the vpme.de Quad Drum: kick snare, and foley samples. The left out of the QD is split to dry and also to the Tiptop z5000 for fx. The right out of the QD is split to dry and to the QU-Bit Prism for fx. \n\nBoth effects unit are being modulated by the Abstract Devices ADE-32. The bitcrushed sound fades in is the drums through Qu-Bit Prism, with modulation from Pam's and the ADE-32.\n\nThe small hihat is the Audio Damage Neuron set to noise only, modulating\nthe decay by hand. \n\nThe long high synth sound is the Piston Honda wavetable module\nsequenced by Hermod, with a low chance to play a note. It's envelope is generated by Quart. \n\nRings and the Pico Voice are both making plucked string sounds. They\u2019re set to ratchet and have a medium chance to occur, all using the effects within\nthe Hermod. Rings is being sent to the same effects unit as the samples.\n\nPlaits is supposed to be doing a deep bass, but its connection to the mixer\nwas dodgy, and it only comes in a bit later.\n\nThe high arp synth is the Joranalogue Generate 3, hand modulating its phase\nand its envelope, through Quart.\n\nThe Tetrapad is set to modulate the Rample pitch but I did not use\nit all that much.\n\nEverything not going through a eurorack effect unit is running into a mixer,\nwith an aux send to the Zoia. The Zoia is running a reverb and delay, but the input is high-passed so that only the high frequencies receive the effect which leaves my bass dry and centered.\n\nBy combining chance values in the Hermod, Euclidian modulation through\nPamela\u2019s New Workout, and cycling uncertainty with the samples, we create a self-evolving tapestry of sound and form.\n\nSequencing and modulation\nArturia Keystep Pro: https://reverb.grsm.io/keysteppro\nSquarp Hermod: https://reverb.grsm.io/hermod\nMaleko Varigate 8+: https://reverb.grsm.io/varigate8\nBusy Circuits Pam's New Workout: https://reverb.grsm.io/pams\nIntelijel Tetrapad: https://reverb.grsm.io/tetrapad\nAbstract Data ADE-32: https://reverb.grsm.io/ade32\nAfter Later Piques: https://reverb.grsm.io/alpiques\n\nDrums and sampling\nSquarp Rample: https://reverb.grsm.io/rample\nQD Quad Drum Module: https://reverb.grsm.io/vpmeqd\n\nOscillators\nMutable Instruments Plaits: https://reverb.grsm.io/plaits\nIME Piston Honda MKIII: https://reverb.grsm.io/pistonhonda\nErica Synths Pico Voice: https://reverb.grsm.io/espico\nJoranalogue Generate 3: https://reverb.grsm.io/generate3\n\nEffects\nAfter Later Monsoon: https://reverb.grsm.io/almonsoon\nTipTop Audio z5000: https://reverb.grsm.io/z5000\nErica Black Hole DSP: https://reverb.grsm.io/blackhole8161\nQubit Prism: https://reverb.grsm.io/qubitprism\n\nOther stuff\nHappy Nerding VCF: https://reverb.grsm.io/hnvcf\nHappy Nerding PanMix (and Jr.): https://reverb.grsm.io/hnpanmix \nIntellijel Quad VCA: https://reverb.grsm.io/intquadvca\nNano Machines Quart: https://reverb.grsm.io/quart\n------------------------------------\nThanks for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording.
