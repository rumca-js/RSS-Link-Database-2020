The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Ann Powers | October 6, 2020
The first time I heard Little Big Town, I knew they needed to play the Tiny Desk. This was eight years ago, when the country foursome made a splash with the playful hit "Pontoon." The easy fun these friends projected won me over, but I stayed for the crazy powerful harmonies. I soon discovered that Little Big Town had been perfecting its vocal blend for more than a decade – and the group just got better, and more adventurous, as its star rose. In 2014 came the spine-tingling ballad "Girl Crush," in 2017 the Taylor Swift collaboration "Better Man." Both songs won Grammys. This year Little Big Town topped itself with its ninth album, Nightfall, a perfect balance of meditative moments and bangers that extends its reign as country's greatest contemporary quartet.

Little Big Town was making plans to appear at the Desk before the pandemic descended; instead, the members woodshedded separately, with married couple Jimi Westbrook and Karen Fairchild taking some beach time and Kimberly Schlapman and Phillip Sweet focusing on their own families. Returning to Nashville as the school year began, they gathered their expert band together (including a surprise guest trumpeter) for a career-spanning session in Fairchild and Wesbrook's living room. Early on, Fairchild notes that this is the longest the singers have spent apart in 25 years. You wouldn't know it. From the lush balladry of "Nightfall" to the party fun of "Wine, Beer, Whiskey" – and onward through absolutely chills-inducing versions of two of their biggest hits – Little Big Town shows how four voices can become one, and so much more than the sum of the parts.

Presenting the 2020 winner of NPR's Tiny Desk Contest, Supported by State Farm

Oct. 5, 2020 || Linda Diaz -- Winning the Tiny Desk Contest has been a surreal experience for me, not only because it's a big, big honor, but because it's all happening in the midst of a global pandemic. Even just shooting my Tiny Desk (home) concert has been a wild ride: getting the band together, getting the NPR team together, figuring out how to shoot safely with everyone in New York City. At one point, we finally had everything set and ready to go. Then, days before the shoot, I tested positive for COVID-19. I will spare you all the details (lots of tears, lots of phone calls), but I am so grateful for my band, the NPR Music team and the Javits Center for going above and beyond for me, the human as much as me, the musician.

Even though I couldn't be at the Desk, I'm feeling lucky to have been able to share some extra little parts of my personality with my (home) concert. Like, how dope is it to be able to say that I'm not only the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest winner, but that we were the first musicians ever to perform on the top of the Javits Center?! In more ways than one, this concert is a victory and a dream come true for me.

Through this whole process, it has felt weird to be celebrating, but what has been reiterated time and again is that it is more than OK to be Black and celebrate and mourn and organize and rest and any other number of things. Black joy is radical because it actively opposes defeat. It is necessary.

"Magic"
"Green Tea Ice Cream"
"Honesty"
