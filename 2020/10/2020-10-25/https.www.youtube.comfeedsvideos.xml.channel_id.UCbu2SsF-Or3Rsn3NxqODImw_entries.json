Of course, that doesn't mean you should.\n\nIn the video above, we walk through some of our favorite recruits. These men and women are the best of the best (in our humble opinion, anyway), and we encourage you to keep an eye out for them when you jump into Watch Dogs Legion.\n\nWhen Ubisoft says that you can recruit almost anyone in Watch Dogs Legion, the developer means it. Our list of favorite recruits includes a shit-kicking granny (yes, it's that one--you've all seen her), a 70-year dominatrix with a powerful spiked bat, a gold-colored performance artist, and a sex worker with a mean spending habit.\n\nEach brings their own unique skill set to the table, whether that's silently taking out enemies, antagonizing guards, hacking computers, sabotaging equipment, beating baddies to a pulp, or pulling off perfect shots in the middle of a firefight. Humans are inherently flawed though. So recruits can have notable weaknesses too--some are just for laughs but others can pose genuine problems that you'll have to consider before putting them into the field.\u00a0\n\nWatch Dogs Legion launches for Xbox One, PS4, and PC on October 29. Want to play the game on next-gen? You'll have to wait a bit longer--Legion releases for Xbox Series X|S on November 10 and PS5 on November 12.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIi_ztm_--k", "date_published": "2020-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Series X|S \u2013 Official Next-Gen Walkthrough \u2013 Full Demo", "description": "Please enjoy this full demo walkthrough of the Xbox Series X|S platform experience \u2013 including UI/UX, refreshed interface, dashboard design, and more \u2013 ahead of the November 10th next-gen launch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0dnrY2TnWA", "date_published": "2020-10-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Mario Kart Live Vs.
