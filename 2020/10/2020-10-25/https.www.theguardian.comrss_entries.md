<p>The Chiefs crave a final showdown with southern hemisphere champions but international call-ups may prove a big obstacle</p><p>Back in his days as a powerboat racer Exeter’s chairman, Tony Rowe, once broke a world speed record one misty October morning on Lake Windermere in 1976. Conditions were not ideal and he was stiff and tired having spent the previous night in an unheated camper van. Rowe was as surprised as anyone when he returned to shore to be told he had set a fastest time.</p><p>Having seen the relentless Chiefs complete the ultimate club rugby achievement by securing a Champions Cup and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/oct/24/exeter-seal-double-beat-wasps-premiership-final-match-report" title="">Premiership double at a soaking Twickenham</a>, he now fancies another tilt at global domination, this time on dry land.

## The Bridge review – the TV version of a dire corporate away-day

<p>It was supposed to be a show about teamwork and logistics in the face of adversity. Instead, this quest to win £100,000 consists mostly of participants bickering and moaning</p><p>The Bridge (Channel 4) is at just over its halfway point, and Saga Norén is yet to appear in her little green sports car to talk about how much she likes sex while solving Scandinavia’s most twisted murders. Alas, this is <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-bridge">The Bridge</a>, not <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/b03bnc34/the-bridge">The Bridge</a>: the latest in a long line of survival shows where contestants must work together in order to reach an island in the middle of a lake, where £100,000 is being held. Or at least they think it is. In order to jazz up an exercise wheeled out by corporate away-days, various dastardly twists have been introduced, reducing the prize fund and – more importantly – causing everyone to argue with each other, all the time.</p><p>This is standard survival-show fare. The contestants are kept hungry, so they argue about how hungry they are. They do not all hold the same view of teamwork, so they argue about who is pulling their weight and who is not. Nobody seems capable of agreeing on much, which, given that all they have to do is string a few logs on to some plastic, ad infinitum, is quite remarkable. The actual task of bridge-building appears to be so repetitive that it is barely shown on screen. Instead, they bicker and bicker.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/oct/25/the-bridge-review-the-tv-version-of-a-dire-corporate-away-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The country’s fairways take up a huge amount of green space – and many were thrown open to the public during lockdown. Should that change be made permanent?</p><p><a href="https://www.hollingburygc.co.uk/">Hollingbury </a><a href="https://www.hollingburygc.co.uk/">golf </a><a href="https://www.hollingburygc.co.uk/">course</a> is a big splodge of green bleeding into Brighton’s grey urban sprawl. For more than a century, its 18 holes have risen above the seaside city towards the ruins of an iron age hillfort, which is now enclosed by holes nine, 12, 13, and 14. From Hollingbury’s highest point, it is possible to look west on a clear day and see the hills of the Isle of Wight.</p><p>As housing has spread around the course, which is owned by the council, so has tension between golfers and walkers, who are permitted to cut across it on a network of footpaths and old drovers’ tracks. Relations seem calm on the autumn day I visit, but I gather “Fore!” is not the only four-letter exclamation to have bounced along the manicured fairways.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/25/we-had-nudity-on-the-greens-the-battle-over-britains-golf-courses">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Body image issues are rising fast among men. But positivity campaigners are raising the profile of men of all shapes and sizes</p><p>Back in 2013, Kelvin Davis was shopping for a red blazer in his home town of Columbia, South Carolina, when he was publicly body shamed. The school teacher, who is 5ft 10in and wears 38in waist trousers, had not previously been concerned about his frame. “The tipping point was when the sales assistant told me I was too big to shop there,” he says, adding it was made worse by the fact that others overheard. “I felt very insecure and didn’t know how to deal with that.”</p><p>So he turned online, launching his blog, <a href="https://notoriouslydapper.com/kelvin-davis/" title="">Notoriously Dapper</a>. Davis felt overlooked by the fashion industry, because of his size and colour. The blog enabled him to delight in fashion, talk about his body and interact with other guys who felt vulnerable. People were initially puzzled – “They’d say: what’s a men’s body-positivity blog?” recalls Davis – but, in time, his loud shirts and sunny outlook attracted a loyal following. He now has 15,000 blog subscribers and more than 92,000 Instagram followers – and has modelled for brands including Gap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/oct/25/no-more-mr-muscle-the-activists-raising-body-confidence-for-men">Continue reading...</a>

## The big picture: magical realism in everyday Dublin

<p>Tony O’Shea’s bewitching image, taken on the upper deck of a city bus, finds the magic in the everyday</p><p>The Irish writer Colm Tóibín was first introduced to the photographs of Tony O’Shea when he was an editor at a magazine called <em>In Dublin</em> back in the late 1970s. O’Shea was in the habit of coming to the magazine’s office every other Friday with a cardboard box containing a fortnight’s black-and-white prints, pictures he’d taken around the city’s streets. The photographs, Tóibín observed, in the introduction to their landmark collaborative book of 1990, <em>Dubliners</em>, “were like nothing I’d ever seen”. He looked forward to O’Shea’s arrival, and each time, though the magazine might be going to press, found himself “taking the cardboard box away with me, looking through the photos again and again on my own and wondering about them”.</p><p>It was Tóibín who first sent O’Shea out on Dublin buses for a story to capture the life of the city from the upper deck. You would never say of O’Shea’s pictures that anything was typical of his work, but this photograph taken in 1989 of two boys and the kestrel is a memorable example of the magical realism that he so often seemed to locate in the everyday. Strange animal spirits are everywhere apparent in his pictures: raggedy boys stand on horseback on city streets, hounds are held at bay on misty bogland; in a famous series, Dublin housewives carry Christmas turkeys home from a side-street butcher, heads and necks and beaks dangling at their knees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/25/the-big-picture-magical-realism-in-everyday-dublin">Continue reading...</a>
