World Health Organization, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus

Critical juncture, tough times ahead for the countries in the Northern Hemisphere

The next few months are going to be very tough and some countries are on a dangerous track

Fall/winter surge has begun, cases and deaths

Several weeks behind the massive surge in Europe

Surge will intensify in November and December, reaching a peak in January

Many states, enormous pressure on hospital capacity

Re-impose some social distancing mandates

Expand mask use

 Current situation 

Cases and deaths up

Deaths, 680 per day last week, now 710

Effective R, over 1 in many Northern states

Also in Nevada, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, Mississippi and Alabama

Trends in key drivers of transmission (mobility, mask use, testing, and seasonality)
 
Largely unchanged over the last week

Mobility remains constant at the national level

Only California and Hawaii have levels that are less than 35% of the pre-COVID-19 baseline

Approximately two-thirds, wearing a mask outside the home

Lowest mask use rates are in Wyoming, North Dakota, and South Dakota
 
Projections 

Daily deaths to reach nearly 2,200 a day in mid-January

Cumulative deaths by February 1, 386,000

Assumes re-imposition of social distancing mandates when the daily death rate reaches 8 
per million

Expanding mask use to 95% ....

the level seen in Singapore

can greatly delay the imposition of mandates and save 
63,000 lives
