He mixed the prints together, creating a patchwork of florals, stripes, checks and graphics which was to become his signature. His eclectic, rule-breaking aesthetic struck a chord, and was widely copied. By the middle of the 1970s, his catwalk shows were stadium-sized events, besieged by fans attempting to gain entry, often running three hours late and with a rock music soundtrack. His glamorous clients included Bianca Jagger and Catherine Deneuve.<br /><br />Kenzo\u2019s move from Tokyo to Paris was the catalyst for a succession of Japanese-owned fashion houses in Paris, which have been hugely influential on fashion in the past half century. Issey Miyake and Kansai Yamamoto arrived in Paris in the wake of his success. The roll call of younger designers who his work has influenced includes Dries Van Noten and Marc Jacobs.</p><p>Kenzo sold his brand to LVMH in 1993, and retired in 1999.
