## Kenzo: widely copied rule-breaker who shook up Paris fashion

<p>Kenzo Takada not only paved way for other Japanese designers but influenced likes of Dries Van Noten</p><p>Kenzo Takada enriched and expanded what Paris fashion could be. Arriving in the city from Tokyo as a young designer in 1964, he brought with him the tastes and traditions of his native Japan and expanded the horizons of the French fashion world.<br /><br />One of the first male students to be admitted to Tokyo’s Bunka fashion college in the late 1950s, he pioneered an exuberant and experimental use of volume, print and colour that did not conform to conventions of masculine and feminine clothing.<br /><br />As a penniless young designer in 1970, Kenzo made his first collection out of the only material he could afford – mixed bolts of cheap fabric, bought in bulk from a market in Montmartre. He mixed the prints together, creating a patchwork of florals, stripes, checks and graphics which was to become his signature. His eclectic, rule-breaking aesthetic struck a chord, and was widely copied. By the middle of the 1970s, his catwalk shows were stadium-sized events, besieged by fans attempting to gain entry, often running three hours late and with a rock music soundtrack. His glamorous clients included Bianca Jagger and Catherine Deneuve.<br /><br />Kenzo’s move from Tokyo to Paris was the catalyst for a succession of Japanese-owned fashion houses in Paris, which have been hugely influential on fashion in the past half century. Issey Miyake and Kansai Yamamoto arrived in Paris in the wake of his success. The roll call of younger designers who his work has influenced includes Dries Van Noten and Marc Jacobs.</p><p>Kenzo sold his brand to LVMH in 1993, and retired in 1999. Since 2019 the brand has been designed by Felipe Oliviera Baptista, who presented his most recent Kenzo collection a few days ago.<br /><br /><br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/oct/04/kenzo-widely-copied-rule-breaker-who-shook-up-paris-fashion">Continue reading...</a>

Pre-tax profits at the group, founded in 2006 by Carol Kane and Mahmud Kamani, jumped 51% to £68.1m in the six months to 31 August. Sales surged to £816.5m. Without talking to Boohoo’s customers, it would be rash to draw conclusions about why reports of appalling labour practices by the company’s suppliers in Leicester have not changed their shopping habits. What can be safely assumed is that people aiming for improvements cannot leave it to consumers to drive them.</p><p>This should not come as a surprise. Fair and ethical trading initiatives are important. Over time it is to be hoped that more people, including the 16-30 age range targeted by Boohoo, will become more curious about the environmental and human impacts of their tastes and choices. But fashion lags a long way behind food in this area. And the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/aug/30/revealed-shocking-lack-of-regulation-at-leicester-garment-factories" title="">failures of regulation</a>, corporate governance and business culture that have been so brutally exposed in the case of Boohoo require a strategic and policy response, not a consumer-led, behavioural one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/04/the-guardian-view-on-boohoo-and-fast-fashion-no-quick-fix">Continue reading...</a>

## Harry Kane stars in Tottenham's 6-1 thrashing of hapless Manchester United

<p>Farcical, hapless and concerning: three words to describe an absolute horror show from Manchester United, who on this evidence would struggle to give a parks team a contest. This was the first time since November 1957 – also against Tottenham – that they conceded four in the first half and when Harry Kane scored a late penalty United had equalled their record Premier League defeat, having also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/23/manchester-united-manchester-city-premier-league" title="">gone down 6-1 here</a> to Manchester City in 2011.</p><p>Every side can have an off-day and while Spurs deserve plaudits for ruthlessly punishing their hosts, the real question is where Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side go next. The manager has the international break to digest this but though Porto’s Alex Telles and Edinson Cavani are close to joining, a left-back and a 33-year-old striker hardly appear the answer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/04/manchester-united-tottenham-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

The village would make the most of the existing natural landscape, setting little terraces of arts and crafts houses along streets edged with grass verges. Not only would their interiors would be flooded with fresh air, natural light and “a cheerful outlook”, they would also have the modern luxury of indoor loos. Designed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2003/dec/01/architecture.regeneration">garden city doyens Raymond Unwin and Barry Parker</a>, the development went on to inspire the national Homes Fit for Heroes programme after the first world war, paving the way for the birth of council housing.</p><p>More than a century on, York is set to break the mould once again. Plans have just been submitted for the first stage of arguably the UK’s most ambitious council-led housing programme in a generation. The city is planning to build at least 600 homes across eight sites within the ring road, each designed to have a net carbon emissions figure of zero. Every element of the scheme, from the front door out into the transport network, is tuned to tackle the climate emergency head on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/04/everest-zero-carbon-inside-yorks-green-home-revolution">Continue reading...</a>

## Melanie C: Melanie C review – a genuine statement

<p>(Red Girl Media)<br />The former Spice Girl lands some serious punches on a mature, embracing album with nods to neo-disco and deep house</p><p>Pop stars love to say they’re finally “the real me”, although the declaration often straddles some pretty generic music. Melanie C’s eighth album feels different: “I’ve got nothing left to hide,” she sings on Who I Am, earning her self-affirmation by fulfilling the promise. The song evokes Bronski Beat and Stuart Price-era Pet Shop Boys, implicitly acknowledging her queer icon status; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SQcsGbRNYY">Blame It </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SQcsGbRNYY">on Me</a>’s deep house throb harks back to her teenage rave years, and she keeps pace with Dua Lipa – as a neo-disco revivalist and vocal beast – on the commandingly flirtatious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z89z6syErqY">In and Out of Love</a>.</p><p>The writing pulls similarly few punches, referencing her timid Spice Girls years and a manipulative relationship, and shaming an ageist music industry (“They said I was too old... But I’m on fire,” the 46-year-old sings on Here I Am). There’s some boilerplate empowerment: Fearless, with rapper Nadia Rose, is fairly trite, but, set to confidently mellow production instead of predictable post-<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sia-furler">Sia</a> bombast, it transcends the cliches and feels genuinely enveloping.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/04/melanie-c-melanie-c-review-a-genuine-statement">Continue reading...</a>

## Less hotel, more gentrified flophouse: The Albion Rooms, Margate – review

<p>A strange venture for the Libertines, a band that crashed around Camden in the 00s</p><p>At some point we’re going to have to confront the idea of whether the Libertines’ new venture The Albion Rooms is a hotel or not, so we may as well do it now and I am going to argue not. Sure, the place has all the markers of a hotel – lush-smelling locked-to-the-wall handsoap in the bathrooms (Haeckels bladderwrack + fennel, in case you were wondering), a miniature fridge in every room, large room keys tied to a massive wooden pellet as a keyring. A bunch of things that convincingly make the argument that The Albion Rooms is a hotel. But then you go through a door and a band is merrily recording a single in there. Then you open your wardrobe and there’s a quite frightening picture of Jesus painted inside. There’s tea and coffee facilities but there’s also a curated box of Libertines-endorsed vape juice, sitting by the teabags. At some point during the night, the mask of “hotel” slips, and The Albion Rooms becomes something other: an escape room just for goths, an afterparty from a very sumptuous music video. It’s less a boutique B&amp;B, more a place you happen to sleep in while having the luckiest bender of your life.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/dec/11/the-libertines-review-victoria-warehouse-manchester-carl-barat-pete-doherty">The Libertines review – still creating their own mythic England</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/oct/04/less-hotel-more-gentrified-flophouse-the-albion-rooms-margate-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Covid-19 and online shopping have put malls on the brink of extinction. But will we miss them when they’re gone?</p><p>As you cruise round the ring road at 50mph, they slide into view: huge square hulks with their supernaturally bright colours and 6ft lettering. Underappreciated and rarely discussed, commercial retail parks are a major part of the UK’s economic and social life. But now, amid a combination of long-term trends and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/sep/14/uk-retailers-fall-in-shoppers-covid-lockdown">impact of coronavirus</a>, they might be on their way out.</p><p>To understand why, we must understand why retail parks exist in the first place. The first was the Kalamazoo Mall in Texas, designed in 1959 by Viennese architect Victor Gruen. Envisioned as the ideal urban experience, it was intended as a way of capitalising on the popularity of the car. Gruen included more than shops in his proposals: he wanted medical centres, libraries, even apartments. The mall spawned so many derivations around the world – with the UK particularly keen – that in 1978 Gruen disavowed his creation, insisting: “I refuse to pay alimony for those bastard developments.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/04/the-uks-retail-parks-were-once-the-future-now-they-look-like-drab-relics-of-the-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Magnum photographer Christopher Anderson sensed something poignant when he began creating images of his young children</p><p>At the end of his book of images of his daughter, Pia, <a href="https://www.magnumphotos.com/photographer/christopher-anderson/">Christopher Anderson</a> includes a short letter. “Dear Pia,” it begins, “the making of these photographs must seem as natural to you as butter and toast. I probably photographed you every day of your life that I have been with you. There are too many days when travel and work took me away. But, truth be told, we’ve had more conversations about brushing teeth than about creating photos.”</p><p>That naturalness was what made Anderson, a celebrated photographer of the frontlines of war and conflict zones in his earlier career, start making portraits of his children. There was no editorialising – that necessity for photojournalists to find a picture that gave an angle to a particular story – he could simply photograph exactly what interested him visually. Anderson’s first book in this mode came after his son Atlas was born in 2008; at the time it did not occur to him that those pictures would become part of his “work”. The more he looked, though, the more he sensed that everything he had done up to that point, on assignment for the Magnum agency in Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, was a preparation for these personal stories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/04/the-big-picture-a-father-tries-to-freeze-time">Continue reading...</a>

## Are Tory MPs really so surprised that Boris Johnson is a poor prime minister? | Andrew Rawnsley

<p>The Conservatives who now weep that he has lost the plot knew all about the PM’s many flaws when they elected him as leader</p><p>Who knew? Boris Johnson isn’t much good in a crisis. What a shock. He bluffs and blusters, he lacks self-discipline and doesn’t do detail. Quelle surprise. He over-promises and under-delivers. Blow me down. He’s a laugh making an after-dinner speech to an inebriated audience, but not who you want in charge of the sober complexities of modern government in the middle of a pandemic. You amaze me. He is a man without firm principles who doesn’t have a coherent guiding philosophy. I’d never have guessed.</p><p>In difficult times, we must take our pleasures where we can find them and one delight has been the tragic parade of distressed Conservative MPs and dolorous Tory newspapers bewailing the flailing performance of their government as they weep that the prime minister has lost the plot. Hearing them, I react as Oscar Wilde reputedly did to the death of Little Nell in Charles Dickens’s <em>The Old Curio</em><em>sity Shop</em>. One would have to have a heart of stone to read of the death of Tory faith in Boris Johnson without dissolving into tears… of laughter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/04/are-tory-mps-really-so-surprised-that-mr-johnson-is-a-poor-prime-minister">Continue reading...</a>

His colleague was horrified. “If you don’t spend your budget,” he said, “they won’t think we’re doing anything!”</p><p>Soon afterwards, Suzman was chatting with a board director about what they’d do if they won the lottery. Suzman thought of the director’s massive townhouse and annual bonus.

<p>Tattooing ‘Freedom’ and ‘Space’ on his fists will surely limit the actor’s roles, but is his new political party a plausible alternative?</p><p>When I’m being an actor, I am sometimes called upon to remove my wedding ring. It seems that I come across plausibly as unmarried. Somehow I can portray isolated and loveless figures without putting much strain on the audience’s suspension of disbelief. The trouble is that, when I do remove it, its clear imprint remains on my pudgy finger. So, from the wrist down, I don’t look like an unmarried man. I look like a tubby and faithless affair-seeker haunting the bar of a suburban Marriott.</p><p>This worries me because I wasn’t absolutely the most transformative of actors in the first place, so the last thing I need is the fatness and lack of plasticity of my fingers to halve the number of roles I’m in the running for. Under current economic conditions, I really need to be able to play the unattractive loner <em>and </em>the overweight, aspirant adulterer. Perhaps I should develop a sort of flesh-coloured adhesive putty to fill in the groove left by the ring. And, actually, if I got the recipe just right, maybe I could then market it to all the plump swordsmen out there, looking to pocket their promises alongside their wedding bands without having to put their fingers on a diet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/oct/04/hands-up-who-takes-laurence-fox-seriously">Continue reading...</a>

Her new book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/if-then-9781529386158.html">If Then</a></em>, tells the story of the Simulmatics Corporation – “the Cambridge Analytica of the 1960s” – which used emerging computer technology to try to predict human behaviour and win elections. This interview took place the day before the first US presidential debate.</p><p><strong>Reading about the extraordinary history of the Simulmatics </strong><strong>Corporation and its “People Machine”, it was instructive to see how the anxieties we have today about the more sinister aspects of computer technology were very present </strong><strong>60 years ago. Did that surprise you?<br /></strong>If anything, I think in the 50s and 60s – because so few people had direct experience of computers – there was even more concern than there is now. Computers were associated with vast power. It was only with the arrival in the 1980s and 1990s of the personal computer we were sold the idea that the technology was participatory and liberal. I think we have returned, in a way, to the original fears, now we sense that these personal devices very much represent the power of vast corporations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/oct/04/jill-lepore-when-did-we-hand-google-twitter-and-facebook-the-reins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The polo shirt has been sported over decades by pop stars, football fans, ska-lovers and gay revellers, but now also by the far-right Proud Boys</p><p>When British tennis champion Fred Perry became the first player to win a career grand slam in 1935, he might have hoped his legacy would be defined by the stunning bit of history he made, still just 26 years old. It’s unlikely he could have predicted his name would be used in 2020 to uniform a far-right male militia jacked up on violence and misogyny. And yet, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/30/proud-boys-who-are-far-right-group-that-backs-donald-trump">Proud Boys</a>, an organisation allegedly founded as a joke by Gavin McInnes in the run-up the 2016 US election, has become instantly recognisable by its allegiance to Fred Perry’s black and yellow trim polo, forcing the brand to publicly distance itself and announce last week that it had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/28/fred-perry-withdraws-polo-shirt-adopted-by-far-right-proud-boys" title="">withdrawn sales of the shirt</a> in the US and Canada a year ago.</p><p>McInnes, 50, is the Scottish-Canadian co-founder of Vice Media, and lives in Brooklyn. He believes western culture is under siege and that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BZ_iPmCzgM&amp;list=PLe8yFmdhlqhAqr_pmie3yHUFnYUgYYNIG" title="">feminism is a cancer</a>. His group, much like an enraged Reddit sub-forum given vein-popping physical form, has been <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/proud-boys" title="">described as an alt-right fight club and hate group by Southern Poverty Law Centre</a> (SPLC), as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/29/trump-proud-boys-debate-president-refuses-condemn-white-supremacists" title="">white supremacists by Joe Biden</a>,and classified as an extremist group by the FBI – even though McInnes rejects the notion that Proud Boys are racists . It is not, by a long stretch, a good look for Fred Perry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/oct/04/fashion-or-fascist-the-long-tussle-over-that-fred-perry-logo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Actor sets ‘the record straight’ on Desert Island Discs over incident growing up in care that led her to spend three nights in cell</p><p>The English actress Samantha Morton, star of the hit television series <em>Harlots</em> and <em>The Walking Dead</em>, has publicly apologised for threatening the life of a young girl with a knife when she was 14.</p><p>Morton, 43, said she wanted to “set the record straight a little bit” on BBC Radio 4’s <em>Desert Island Discs</em>. The Oscar-nominated star was “incredibly sorry” about the incident, which led to her being charged with attempted murder and spending three days in solitary confinement in an adult cell block. She was convicted of threats to kill after she had confronted an older girl who had been bullying at the care home where they both lived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/04/samantha-morton-apologises-on-radio-for-knife-threat-to-girl-when-she-was-14">Continue reading...</a>

<p>John Cusack talks about political activism, Hollywood, the highs and lows of his 30-year career – and Utopia, the new TV series set to warm him up</p><p>Two o’clock, Chicago time. The curtains are down against a bright afternoon sun and John Cusack, who is by reputation a late riser, takes a seat at the breakfast counter in his kitchen. For decades this storied, experienced and rather solitary-seeming actor has dressed all in black. Today is no exception. He wears a black T-shirt, black bandana and a black leather biker’s jacket. But for the incongruous cup he’s drinking coffee from (a medieval-style flagon, large as a flowerpot) Cusack could be one of those menacing motorcycle dudes who parks himself next to you at an American dive bar and starts explaining, unbidden, how he once killed a man but in error.</p><p>He turned 54 in the summer. The voice is gravellier than when you knew it best, when Cusack was in his mid-30s heyday and playing those brilliant lovelorn everymen in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/being-john-malkovich" title="">Being John Malkovich</a></em> (1999), <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jul/21/nickhornby" title="">High Fidelity</a></em> (2000) and <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/dec/21/1" title="">Serendipity</a></em> (2001). The eyes, always so coolly narrowed when Cusack first made a name for himself as a teen star of the 80s, are more starey and tired these days. He rubs them a lot while he talks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/04/john-cusack-i-have-not-been-hot-for-a-long-time">Continue reading...</a>

This was not an accident.</p><p>“I named three Labour leaders. Three that won. That’s why I named them,” he responds briskly. Clement Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair are the only Labour leaders to have secured parliamentary majorities. “I was trying to get across a really important message to the party, the movement and the country. And that is that the Labour party needs to be a party of government. We can spell out our vision, we can have fantastic policies. But unless we win an election, we are not going to do anything to change lives.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/04/we-have-a-mountain-to-climb-keir-starmer-on-winning-the-next-election">Continue reading...</a>
