It’s the last Premier League game of 2020, and Liverpool’s final match of a momentous year in which they won their first league title since 1990. Their title defence hasn’t reached the same awesome heights, at least not consistently, but they are still top and will move five points clear of Manchester United if they win tonight. It’s not exactly a crisis.</p><p>Newcastle have had a decent season in terms of results, especially given the Covid outbreak that hit them so hard, but there has been the usual discontent over their style of play. That’s unlikely to change tonight, though given the opposition it feels less important: if Newcastle draw 1-1 through a thrice-deflected 94th-minute goal from Jonjo Shelvey, having had 4 per cent of the possession, they’ll have had a good night. Any change in style will have to wait till next year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/dec/30/newcastle-v-liverpool-premier-league-live">Continue reading...</a>

## Brexit is far from done – this deal is no ‘game, set and match' | Anand Menon

<p>On 1 January we move from prophecy to reality. There is a lot more of this match to go, and the result is not clear</p><p>It is hard to imagine a better outcome for the prime minister. Four and a half years after the EU referendum, he clinched an <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2531">agreement with the EU</a> that many thought impossible. Nigel Farage’s declaration that “<a href="https://twitter.com/nigel_farage/status/1342056303661879297?s=21">the war is over</a>” underlined that Johnson had done so without alienating even the most hardline Brexiters. If Labour’s support was the icing on the cake, a YouGov poll that showed a <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/trackers/how-the-government-is-handling-the-issue-of-brexit-in-the-uk">marked increase</a> in the proportion of voters who thought the government was handling Brexit well (from 24% on 20 December to 37% on 28 December), was the cherry.</p><p>So, game and first set to Boris Johnson. If perhaps not quite a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagel_(tennis)">bagel</a> , this was, nonetheless, a pretty comprehensive victory. Yet it is worth recalling two things about the tennis scoring system. First, (and for the benefit of some remainers) once you have lost a set, there is no point dwelling on it. Second, however easily you win the first set, the second starts at love-all. There is a lot more of this match to go – and the result is still not clear. Remember John Major’s press secretary declared that it was <a href="https://ukandeu.ac.uk/unhappy-anniversary-maastricht-25-years-on/">game, set and match</a> to the British prime minister at Maastricht.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/brexit-far-from-done">Continue reading...</a>

Such as it was. The sense of anticlimax was almost tangible.

<p>The imaginary doomsday scenario was never credible to the EU but was a powerful force to shape UK domestic politics</p><p>The threat of a no-deal Brexit has always been a hoax – and it has been one of the most successful deceptions in British political history. It was never a real option but has systematically lowered domestic expectations for a deal and allowed the government to avoid any serious scrutiny. Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/11/no-deal-brexit-likeliest-ursula-von-der-leyen-eu-leaders">played the role</a> of no-deal madman with aplomb, as if he had been born for it.

<p>The public’s goodwill was sacrificed on the altar of Barnard Castle – and will be incredibly difficult to recover</p><p>In the spring of this year, Boris Johnson was World King. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/form/global-leader-approval/">Morning Consult poll</a> in April found that he was the most popular leader in the western world. In January, at a focus group I ran in Darlington, first-time Conservative voters described him as “strong”, “decisive” and “his own man”. He was a leader who would get things done and was one of the first politicians they could remember who seemed to care about the long-ignored place in which they lived. And, for that first portion of the year, there was a flash of something not seen since Tony Blair’s election win in 1997: a remarkable sense of public trust, with voters willing to believe that Johnson’s Conservatives might actually deliver what they had promised.</p><p>Now Johnson sits near the bottom of the world leader rankings. “Weak”, “confused”, “out of his depth” are the words that come out of focus groups today. Voters, <a href="https://twitter.com/TimesRadio/status/1339523231829487621?s=20">especially</a> those in the so-called “red wall”, describe the prime minister as a “puppet”, controlled by his advisers. Though they tend to think he is trying his best, they question his competence. He does not attract the same hate that one sees on Twitter, but he is seen as a figure to be pitied as he drags himself to the podium of yet another press conference. Getting a Brexit deal may seem to have given him a Christmas boost, but – given the low salience of the issue to many voters – it is unlikely to permanently change the public’s view of him. He is no longer world king, but seen to be a lost man.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/2020-boris-johnson-public-trust-goodwill-barnard-castle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As Zoom fatigue set in, many of you found creative ways to stay in touch with loved ones</p><p>Some of my friends and I began a lockdown playlist on Spotify, where we would all add one song per day that was either related to how we were feeling or just something we happened to be in the mood for at the time. Music is very emotive: it can create the feeling of your friend’s presence in a way that even a video call or their voice can’t quite manage. We carried on even after the lockdown and did more playlists, where we would take it in turn to think of a theme. Despite physical distance, we were building something together, and it was really nice to be part of it. <strong>Ed, Norfolk</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/30/from-pandemic-postcards-to-picnics-guardian-readers-tips-on-keeping-friends-close">Continue reading...</a>

<p> This warm documentary about Robin Williams reveals how much he was loved by those who knew him</p><p>When Robin Williams died in 2014 at the age of 63, the tabloids filled in the blanks. The front pages speculated on the return of his well-documented demons: Williams had a history of depression, alcohol addiction and cocaine use. Then came the postmortem, revealing that actually he’d been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/03/robin-williams-disintegrating-before-suicide-widow-says">suffering from an undiagnosed degenerative brain disease, Lewy body dementia</a>. Which explained his symptoms in last 18 or so months of life: Parkinson’s-like tremors, visual hallucinations, paranoid delusions and sleep disturbance. As a neurologist puts it, he must have been terrified.</p><p>In this sensitive, desperately sad documentary, Williams’s widow, Susan Schneider, along with friends and colleagues, describes his decline. For a while, things just hadn’t seemed right. There’s footage from the set of his final movie, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb; he looks blank and distracted – the alertness and anarchic wit gone. “He was just sort of off,” says a friend. He couldn’t remember his lines. He hadn’t slept for months. There were times he followed Susan around the house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/30/robins-wish-review-robin-williams">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Four years' work in one’: vaccine researchers are the unassuming heroes of Covid-19

<p>We don’t know their names, but these scientists have been working tirelessly to fight the pandemic. It’s time to say thank you<br /></p><p>Vaccine researchers are not showy. If there is a flashy vaccine researcher out there, I’ve yet to meet them. Most of them talk about their colleagues more than they talk about themselves. In fact if you ask them about the work they are doing, they will invariably tell you how great their team is. Yet this year, more than ever, they deserve to have the spotlight firmly on them. As we watched the first waves of people getting their first vaccine doses and heard their hopes of finally being able to hug loved ones, it was impossible not to be moved. Yet this moment was only taking place because – while many of us were staying home – vaccine researchers were working tirelessly so they could ride to our rescue, armed with the ultimate weapons against the pandemic.</p><p>If this is the beginning of the end of the pandemic, as we all hope, then it’s clear that this has come about through individuals working together for the good of us all. And, make no mistake, these researchers have been working unbelievably hard. One told me they had done the equivalent of four years’ work, in one year. Many people won’t realise that many of them could not just shelve the existing projects they were working on before the Covid-19 pandemic hit — because diseases such as Aids <em>also </em>need vaccines. So, in many cases, these researchers were pulling 14-hour days, in effect doing two jobs. They are working non-stop: skipping meals, not going home, missing family events, dropping hobbies or sacrificing spare time. One researcher told me that the real unsung hero in all of this was her husband, for keeping the family home running – because you cannot make a vaccine without someone cooking you dinner at night and doing your laundry and looking after your kids.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/30/four-years-work-in-one-vaccine-researchers-unassuming-heroes-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After another burnout from overworking, a new clarity shone through my misery: I didn’t want to live like this any more <br /></p><p>One morning in late September, I woke up just before dawn still at my computer. I had been attempting an all-nighter, my fourth or fifth in six months. As the sky started to lighten I went to bed, setting an alarm for two hours’ time; then I started up again, racing to meet a noon deadline. By then I had been working most of the last 24 hours, and most of the last six weeks.</p><p>The crash, when it inevitably came, was more of a hard stop. At around 11.30am my hands froze on the keyboard: I simply could not type another word. Trying to will myself on was a surprisingly physical sensation. I was pushing on a pedal that had got me this far – and finding, with mounting distress, that the tank was bone dry. Closing my laptop felt like a failure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/this-year-work-burnout-misery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Research shows flood victims in UK nine times more likely to experience long-term mental health issues</p><p>When Julie Blackburn was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2016 she was told to avoid her triggers, scenarios which cause upsetting flashbacks. “But when your trigger is rain, there is no getting over it,” she said. “My husband and I don’t sleep when it’s raining, we take it in turns to stand at the window watching the rain – it’s just living in constant fear.”</p><p>Blackburn’s house in Old Coulsdon, Croydon, has been flooded several times, first in 2000 when heavy rain overwhelmed the Victorian sewer system and filled her home with toxic waste. Rapid development and poor infrastructure led the south London borough to be rated the fourth worst area in England and Wales for surface water flooding in 2011.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/30/we-dont-sleep-when-its-raining-the-mental-health-impact-of-flooding">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Tom Wolfe’s ‘master of the universe’ to George Eliot’s vengeful pedant, these are some of the hardest characters in literature to love<br /></p><p>At reader events to promote my novels, I find that one question crops up more often than any other: ‘Why do you write such dislikable characters?’ Well, I usually reply, swallowing my defensiveness, don’t all novelists write characters who are dislikable to <em>someone</em>, given that likability is entirely subjective? If niceness is a spectrum, then we’re all on it, for better or worse.</p><p>Take Kit and Melia Roper in <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-other-passenger-9781471183478.html">The Other Passenger</a>. The debt-ridden millennial friends of wealthy Gen Xers Jamie and Clare, they are envious of the older couple’s lifestyle and prepared to take all sorts of risks to raise their own status. You might be sympathetic to their plight (I know I am) or you might take a harder line, but chances are your view on their likability is far more to do with their personalities than their social standing – or even their criminal actions.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/30/top-10-most-dislikable-characters-in-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a miserable 2014, I knew I had to make more time for myself – and my beloved boat</p><p>I don’t make resolutions. But one year I made an exception. It was 1 January 2015. It was the only nod to self-improvement I have ever made – and it changed the course of my life. Very seriously, I resolved to have more fun. I had been inspired by the American folk legend Woody Guthrie, <a href="https://medium.com/udacity/translating-woody-guthries-1943-new-year-s-resolutions-for-2017-f063fbb6c1b7">whose 1943 resolutions had come to light</a>, a list full of such gems as “dream good” and “dance better”. Yes, I thought. Focus on what brings you joy – if that isn’t improvement, I don’t know what is. (I would humbly suggest this is even more pertinent as the cruel joke that is 2020 comes to a close.)</p><p>I had had a tough year, having taken on a difficult project on top of a demanding full-time job and spent the months leading up to Christmas working so hard I barely slept. When I did sleep, I dreamed of the ocean (unsurprisingly, given I was writing a book about sea nomads in my spare time).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/30/i-chose-fun-over-drudgery-and-ran-off-to-live-at-sea">Continue reading...</a>

Fortunately, a friendly group of locals led by the aptly named Jesus, who had some mechanical knowledge, were also heading out to the desert and stopped to help us. Result: a shared trip, wine, food, campfires and songs in English and Spanish under the mystical Atacama skies to see out and welcome in the year in a stunning setting and with great company.<br /><strong>Yasmin Cox</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/dec/30/new-years-eve-celebrations-around-the-world-readers-travel-tips">Continue reading...</a>
