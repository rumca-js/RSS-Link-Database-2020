Six years ago today, on Dec. 30, 2014, Brandi Carlile and her bandmates visited our studio to debut three songs from what was then their forthcoming album, "The Firewatcher's Daughter." It was a thrilling day, and looking back, it's a reminder of the magic that can happen during a studio session with artists. In honor of that occasion, here are three recordings of Carlile performing tracks from "The Firewatcher's Daughter," one in our studio from that December day six years ago, and two from the "Live From Here" archives.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Wherever Is Your Heart"
3:57 "The Eye"
7:39 "The Things I Regret"

Jade Bird recently performed a virtual session and was interviewed by Jill Riley. In 2020, Jade Bird relocated to Austin, Texas, and she's been releasing new music; notably, "Headstart," which you've been hearing on The Current. Two-and-a-half years ago, Jade Bird performed a solo acoustic MicroShow for a small gathering of lucky attendees in a salon at the James J. Hill House — sometimes called "Minnesota's Downton Abbey" — on Summit Avenue in St. Paul. Here are three songs from that unforgettable performance.

Thank you to New Belgium Brewing for its support of The Current's MicroShow series.
