Deprived of the thrill and the income of performing live, he started broadcasting from the guest room of his row house, in South Philadelphia.\" \nWeiner is a friend of The Current; he and Low Cut Connie have performed in our studio a number of times, played Rock the Garden 2018 and played at our Day Party during SXSW 2019. Weiner has hosted the radio program The Connie Club, and not long before the pandemic, Weiner performed a solo MicroShow at the Bryant Lake Bowl in south Minneapolis for a roomful of lucky attendees.
