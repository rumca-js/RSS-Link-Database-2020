In response, Boris Johnson launched tougher tier 4 lockdown restrictions for much of London and the south-east, cancelling the Christmas plans of millions of people just days after saying such a move would be \u201cinhuman\u201d. Devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also launched tougher restrictions. After declining during the second national lockdown in England in November, the seven-day average of new cases has risen to a <a href=\"https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases\">record high of 29,812 as of 15 December</a>. The number of deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test \u2013 which lags behind infections \u2013 has increased to a seven-day average of 398, below a peak of almost 1,000 in early April.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/23/new-covid-variant-and-looming-brexit-disruption-deepen-uk-economic-gloom\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/23/new-covid-variant-and-looming-brexit-disruption-deepen-uk-economic-gloom", "date_published": "2020-12-23 12:00:44+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Premier League: 10 good and bad surprises of the season so far", "description": "<p>Grealish, Fabinho, Calvert-Lewin and Bamford are exceeding expectations.
