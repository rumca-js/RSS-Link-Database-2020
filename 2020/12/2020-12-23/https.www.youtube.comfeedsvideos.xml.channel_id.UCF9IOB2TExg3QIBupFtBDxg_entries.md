Horses and stable doors

SA to Singapore or Doha, or China, or Amsterdam or Paris today

Anyone from SA or contacts, quarantine immediately

Dr. Zweli Mkhize, SA health minister

SA has sequenced hundreds of genomes since the start of the pandemic

young, previously healthy people are now becoming very sick

cannot go through what we went through in the early days of the Aids pandemic

Prof Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London

I think the greatest concern of ours at the moment is the South African one

There's certainly anecdotal reports of explosive outbreaks for that virus and very steep increases in case numbers

Mr Hancock

New variant was highly concerning

Anyone told to quarantine must avoid all contact with any other person whatsoever

Prof Lawrence Young, Warwick Medical School

The move to harsher levels of restriction across the country is inevitable

Alan Winde, Western Cape

Hospitals in the province under severe strain

More Covid-19 cases than during the first wave

Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England 

Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 

https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/reports/uk-novel-variant/2020_12_23_Transmissibility_and_severity_of_VOC_202012_01_in_England.pdf

Appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation

VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible 

95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%

No clear evidence for greater or lesser severity of disease

Increase in transmissibility, a large increase in incidence

COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020

Even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained

Unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed

Large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures

Greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden

Mr Hancock

Six million more people in the east and south east of England, to enter tier four on Boxing Day

Cornwall and Herefordshire up to tier two

Scotland and NI start new lockdowns on Boxing Day.

Old tiering system was not enough to control the new variant

Cases up 57% in past 7 days

Hospital admissions, highest since mid-April
 
East Anglia had seen a "significant number" of cases caused by the new fast-spreading variant


ONS, 12 to 18 December 2020

Continued increase in positivity rates

England

Prevalence = 645,800

One in 85 people. 

Wales

One in 60 people

Northern Ireland

Up to 1 in 180 people

Scotland

Down to 1 in 140 

Rates increased sharply in London, the East of England and the South East.

LA county

One in 80

Fresno County, CA

We had 9,572 new Covid-19 cases last week over seven days, an all time high for us. 

The ICU beds in the county are full. 

A new 50 bed ICU ward was opened today and there are plans to open overflow beds for Covid-19 patients in the convention center

We have been short staffed at my work related to staff members testing positive for Covid-19. 

I find it very frustrating that people I know say this is not a real pandemic because only 1% of patients die. 

Some people are getting very sick and the rest of us need to protect them by wearing masks, social distancing and avoid group situations.

Jeremy Luban, virologist, University of Massachusetts Medical School

It may very well be here. 

It may have even started here. 

The sequencing in the U.S. is so sporadic

It makes sense that it was detected first in the U.K. because they have probably the world’s best surveillance program.

Angela Rasmussen, virologist, Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security

It would not shock me at all to find out that it also is circulating in the U.S

the coronavirus already in the United States is spreading easily

a new variant will not change the need for people to follow public health guidance

I don’t think a travel ban is going to be particularly helpful

We already have out-of-control transmission of all the variants that are circulating in the U.S.

November, 30,000 direct passengers to US from LHR

Mutation / new variant, N501Y, B.1.1.7 

Significance of 2020 12 was not clear until 8th December, by analysing epidemiological data in Kent

Sequencing takes 3 weeks and hundreds are needed for correlation studies 

First identified 21st September

Increased viral load or increased viral shedding?

The country with the best genomic monitoring has the most mutations?

UK sequencing, 45% of global total of sequencing

Denmark has highest per capita sequence, and 10 cases 2020 12 have been picked up there

Australia has picked up 2 cases of 2020 12

There have been contemporaneous increases in incidence in several countries

Mutations occur at equal rate in every part of the world

South Africa mutation has similar effects as 2020 12 but arose separately

Nigeria (206 million) has a sharp increase in cases, despite poor levels of testing and no genomic sequencing

Possible children may be more suspectable to 2020 12

Any one infected person can be infected with a range of viral genomes 

Likelihood of long COVID not likely to be caused by viral variant

Biology of linkage between genetic changes and viral behavioural change is poorly understood

R 0.8 up to 1.2

UK R today 1.2

Europe was R = 3 without controls

More likely to arise in immunocompromised patients
