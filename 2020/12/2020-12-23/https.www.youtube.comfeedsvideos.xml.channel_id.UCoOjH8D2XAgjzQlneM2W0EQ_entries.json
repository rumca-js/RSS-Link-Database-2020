And just like how people are competitive, nations are also very competitive where intel and influence are the names of the game. But how do we get said intel and influence? The problem is that the most powerful people in the nations you\u2019re trying to topple, are usually gonna be the strongest supporters of the regime. So, if the logical side of their brain won\u2019t let them betray their country - we need to attack this problem from a more emotional - dirtier angle. What is the one thing that man can\u2019t resist - a man\u2019s insatiable desire for\u2026 Women! Yes, if we can use women to get powerful politicians under their spell. We\u2019ll call these spies Swallows, or Ravens for the male counterparts.\n\nA great man once said, power is like real estate, the closer you are to the source, the higher your property. So common sense would dictate that we should use our swallows to target the biggest, most powerful politicians right away.  A long term strategy is to get our foot in the door before the politician gets big and powerful.\n\nOur Swallow has to be top-notch attractive. Another deal breaker is that they have to be naturally charismatic. The best, most ideal Chinese Swallows are educated, they attended the top universities, and of course speak perfect English.\n\nToday, it\u2019s a lot simpler. Everyone, including those in power, are just a click away on social media. It is believed they often use social media - such as LinkedIn and Facebook to connect with their prey as they lure them in. If that doesn\u2019t work, America is a buffet of campaign rallies, political events, fundraisers, community get-togethers, business forums, where you can meet your ideal target and strike up a relationship.\n\n\u201cEvery human is a puzzle with a missing piece, learn to fill their need and they\u2019ll give you everything\u201d. The first step is to identify what their deepest desire is. Then in general, you\u2019ll want to draw the man in with an alluring appearance. Once you have them under your spell - make their fantasies come true, nurture their dependence on you and they\u2019ll instantly fall in love. Then, right when they\u2019re in the deepest possible state of love, when they are completely. Drunk. On love - pull back! And boom - this powerful man with the intel and influence you need is now your slave.\n\nBut remember, we\u2019re in this for the long run - it\u2019s much better to stay in a relationship without them ever even knowing. You can keep gathering intel on their habits, preferences, schedules, friends. You can use your influence over them to sway the US on important China-related issues.\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
