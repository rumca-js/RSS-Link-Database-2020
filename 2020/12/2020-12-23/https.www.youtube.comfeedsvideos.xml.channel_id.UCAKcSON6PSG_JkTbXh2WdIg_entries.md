In 2018, JD McPherson and his band released "Socks," an album of instant holiday classics. We were lucky enough in December of that year to welcome JD McPherson and the gang into our studio to perform songs off that album. Enjoy these performances — and look for JD to crack up in anticipation of bandmate Doug Corcoran's baritone whisper of the words, "knee high" after JD sings out, "Socks." 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "All The Gifts I Need"
2:40 "Bad Kid"
6:01 "Socks"

PERSONNEL
JD McPherson – vocals, guitar
Doug Corcoran – saxophone, guitar, xylophone, backing vocals
Ray Jacildo – piano, organ, backing vocals
Jason Smay – drums 
Jimmy Sutton – bass, backing vocals

## Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie - three live performances for The Current (2019; 2020)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDjW34AzewA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDjW34AzewA)

Congratulations go out to Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie, whom The New Yorker named its Pandemic Person of the Year for December 21. "Adam Weiner [is] the songwriter, singer, piano player, and chief showman behind the band — and occasional solo act — Low Cut Connie," wrote Nick Paumgarten in the New Yorker. "His sixth album, 'Private Lives,' came out this fall. … What has enabled him to show off his … chops and his bountiful good vibes — Little Richard meets Mr. Rogers, maybe — is his twice-weekly interactive live stream, called 'Tough Cookies,' which he began in March. Deprived of the thrill and the income of performing live, he started broadcasting from the guest room of his row house, in South Philadelphia." 
Weiner is a friend of The Current; he and Low Cut Connie have performed in our studio a number of times, played Rock the Garden 2018 and played at our Day Party during SXSW 2019. Weiner has hosted the radio program The Connie Club, and not long before the pandemic, Weiner performed a solo MicroShow at the Bryant Lake Bowl in south Minneapolis for a roomful of lucky attendees. Here are three live performances by Adam Weiner and Low Cut Connie, recorded for The Current. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Help Me" (2019)
3:12 "Private Lives" (2019)
7:08 "Stay As Long As You Like" (2020, solo)
