Without the anchors of our normality – of friends, jobs, hobbies, of travel, of our wider families, of human touch and physical closeness – we have been forced to reconsider our places in a world we are unable fully to access. Some anchors, we have learned, we can readily do without; some we have longed to return for so long that in an instant we can be back to taking them for granted. I long to complain about the lack of legroom at a concert or the theatre, and am desperate to feel sick at the cost of a meal for a family of four in a restaurant. I viscerally pine for the frustration of waiting 10 minutes at a bar to be served. I’m counting the days until I can unthinkingly kiss my mum hello.</p><p>When my sister, Karina, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/rory-kinnearsister-protect-vulnerable-coronavirus-rory-kinnear">died in May</a> from coronavirus, I knew I had lost one of the anchors of my life for ever.

<p>Unless this government stops dithering and works to eradicate Covid-19, more variants are bound to emerge</p><p>An emotional rollercoaster is probably the best way to describe the past few weeks. The UK government has lurched from allowing Christmas bubbles to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/21/boris-johnson-cabinet-uk-travel-ban-ministers-covid">cancelling Christmas</a> altogether. Weeks after an effective vaccine was approved, the virus turned a new corner. Some have argued the new mutation is nothing to worry about – viruses mutate all the time. Others think it’s cause for panic. The truth lies somewhere in between.</p><p>With limited information available about the new variant, the lesson from 2020 is to move early and enforce precautions rather than wait for things to unfold. When the government delayed a lockdown in the spring that would have reduced the death rate, Britain learned the hard way that it’s better to prevent an emerging disaster than to wait and watch. As Scotland’s first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, put it: if you see a train speeding towards you, do you wait to see if you get hit, or quickly react to avert the crash?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/covid-mutating-eliminate-virus-eradicate-variants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Broadway’s Eva Noblezada ably holds a tune and the screen in this bittersweet story of an immigrant trying to break into country and western </p><p>Though she came to Texas as a child from the Philippines, 17-year-old Rose Garcia (played by emerging Broadway star Eva Noblezada) has been obsessed with country music since she was knee-high to a grasshopper. Now that her father is dead, she only plays for herself, too shy to share her music even with Elliot (Liam Booth), the cute guy at the music store. Her mother, Priscilla (Princess Punzalan), a housekeeper at a motel, is supportive, even if she nags Rose to put homework first and doesn’t like the idea of Rose going to a gig in Austin with Elliot. But their bickering over curfew times suddenly seems trivial when Priscilla is arrested by immigration police and incarcerated, revealing that neither she nor Rose have the right documentation to make them legal.</p><p>As it looks increasingly likely Priscilla will get deported, Rose goes to stay with her aunt Gail (singer Lea Salonga). But Gail’s prissy white husband makes her feel unwelcome, so she ends up getting taken in first by a kindly bar owner and later on by one of the bar’s star regular performers Dale Watson, here essentially playing himself in a slightly stilted but charming performance. With his tutelage, Rose’s own songwriting skill begins to blossom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/23/yellow-rose-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Virus briefings trounced celeb contests and one man’s tale of a family trip to Durham was the most gripping of all</p><p>Who could have predicted that a softly-spoken 48-year-old who had never previously fronted a TV format would, in 2020, achieve one of the biggest afternoon audiences ever? Or that a 94-year-old veteran broadcaster (who wasn’t Sir David Attenborough) could suddenly triple the ratings for their regular slot? Or that Boris Johnson’s appearances on Have I Got News For You?, the roots of the populist persona that took him to power, now rank as relatively niche appearances on his TV CV?</p><p>But, on 23 March, Johnson was watched by an audience of 27.4 million across six networks as he announced the first national lockdown, with 17.7 million tuning in on 22 September when he outlined revised restrictions, and 17.3 million for his Halloween declaration of a second national lockdown on 31 October. Just between those performances in the state ratings chart was the Queen’s national address on 7 April (with Johnson in hospital) which was watched by 19.39 million across BBC and ITV.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/23/tv-news-2020-covid-ratings-dominic-cummings">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mostly improvised by real bar patrons, this hilarious and sometimes heart-rending Las Vegas drinking session is a classic slice of Americana</p><p>If ever you had the idea there was something bohemian or glamorous or Bukowskian about drinking in a Las Vegas bar … then this movie will wise you right up. It’s a docu-realist fiction about a seedy place called The Roaring 20s, in Las Vegas, which is about to close for good. (The films was actually shot at a place called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Lounge/Roaring-20s-120787667936250/">The Roaring 20s</a> in New Orleans, which is still open for business, but maybe there’s something about the desolation and melancholy in a bar that makes every closing time feel like the last closing time ever.) The film-makers got the barflies present, with one professional actor in the mix, to improvise over a long day’s journey into night and the following day, while doing real drinking and apparently dropping real acid. This isn’t actually as spectacular as they have might have expected; it leads only to a belligerent near-fight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/23/bloody-nose-empty-pockets-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The writer and star of the dysfunctional-family sitcom on his top shows of 2020 and the touching legacy of his hit series</p><p><strong>Was there a </strong><strong>show that everyone else loved this year that you just couldn’t get on with? <br /></strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tiger-king">Tiger King</a>. I couldn’t do it. Something about it felt a little too exploitative for me. I never felt OK when I was watching it. Maybe that’s the main thing. There was a full month when everybody was watching it, when I desperately tried to stay part of the conversation. But I just could not invest. And I don’t know, there is something kind of icky about what was going on there. But this is one man’s opinion in a sea of other people.</p><p><strong>Conversely, were there are any shows you enjoyed over lockdown that you didn’t expect to? <br /></strong>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/oct/24/real-housewives-of-anywhere-what-does-the-series-say-about-the-cities">Real Housewives of Atlanta</a>. I feel like the characters on that show are so strong and opinionated and have a sense of humour and self-awareness. It’s an incredible alchemy. It’s a great social group that they’ve put together to film. I was surprised to enjoy it, because I worked in reality television for a long time. I hosted the aftershow for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/aug/08/the-hills-10-years-on-reality-tv-hollywood-towie-made-in-chelsea-kardashians">The Hills</a> before my career started. And I think that when you work in reality TV, it kind of pulls back the curtain in a way that doesn’t necessarily make you want to watch more of it. So this was the first reality show that I had watched for a really long time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/23/dan-levy-on-schitts-creek-winning-nine-emmys-was-surreal">Continue reading...</a>

Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, announced that the variant, <a href="https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations/563">called B.1.1.7</a>, is up to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/20/fast-spreading-covid-variant-in-england-uk">70% more transmissible</a> based on modelling studies. B.1.1.7 caused many infections in south-east England in a short period of time, rapidly displacing other circulating variants. Patients infected with B.1.1.7 also had higher viral loads.

## On a scale of 1 to 5, how addicted to online surveys am I? Definitely 5 | Eleanor Margolis

<p>During the septic tank of a year that was 2020, I’ve become hooked on ticking boxes online for tiny amounts of cash</p><p>The survey part of the nativity story is too often overlooked. Sure, there’s the the annunciation by a literal angel that a virgin woman is going to have God’s kid, and the eventual birth of said kid in the unlikeliest of places. But we mustn’t forget that the entire reason Mary and Joseph were in Bethlehem was to take part in the census. And I would disagree with anyone who argues this is the least interesting part of the story.</p><p>From the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_of_Quirinius#:~:text=The%20Census%20of%20Quirinius%20was,Roman%20rule%20in%206%20CE.">census of Quirinius</a> to those little feedback cards they used to hand out in Nando’s, there’s nothing as satisfyingly uncomplicated as ticking boxes. Relaxation comes in many shapes and forms. For me, this year, it’s consisted of rating my satisfaction with things on a scale of one to five. My favourite podcasts. My local council. My gas supplier. I mean, how satisfied <em>am</em> I with my gas? It seems pretty gassy. It’s definitely flammable. Could be cheaper, I guess. Four out of five? What a profoundly, meditatively dull thing to contemplate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/addicted-online-surveys-2020">Continue reading...</a>

After a difficult start to 2020 grappling with health issues, I felt incapable of doing anything I’d planned, no matter how much I wanted to see my friends, work or travel. It ran deeper than exhaustion: during my entire life I had struggled with things that other people seemed to find easy, like socialising, employment, education or feeling comfortable in my own body. I often found myself overwhelmed, struggling to connect with people and suffering with sensory overload when faced with certain lights, smells, sounds or textures. I needed more time alone than other people to recover from being in the world, and selfishly, lockdown felt like a blessing.</p><p>I had been made aware of my differences throughout my life, fighting episodes of burnout and self-destruction, chastising myself for my inability to connect with strangers or just feel remotely relaxed. I was always restless, oscillating between distraction and hyper-focus on the wrong things. I found it increasingly difficult to function, but it wasn’t until 2015 that I decided to pursue the answer that some teachers, family members and peers had suggested: a joint diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/23/psychiatrist-diagnosed-autistic-adhd-adult-neurodivergent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From a Jamaican debut to an empty Lord’s in 2020 the job has changed so much but I always did struggle for an intro<br /></p><p>Just one more intro, that’s all that’s needed … “It was 31 years ago that I joined the Observer …” No, no, that’s not so snappy; it’s ancient history and on a par with one I sent off early in my time as its cricket correspondent which began with two riveting words: “Last Wednesday” (thankfully there was an intervention by the desk).</p><p>How about: “It’s hard to write with tears in your eyes”? Just a couple of drawbacks here. It’s a tad over the top – this is for sport for heaven’s sake, not the review section – and it’s not true either. I’ve never really believed Don Bradman had tears in his eyes when he was bowled by Eric Hollies at the Oval in his last Test innings in 1948 and as I stare at a disappointingly empty screen here my eyes remain stubbornly dry. (How can I be so presumptuous to summon up a parallel with the last days of the Don? It must be time to move on.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/dec/23/last-post-after-31-years-farewell-vic-marks-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With fewer people travelling abroad this year, open water swimming has gained popularity in Essex, particularly among women. Photographs by Stefan Rousseau. Written by Sam Russell</p><p>An Essex town is experiencing an explosion in popularity of cold water swimming. One Facebook page for people wanting to swim in Leigh-on-Sea, which launched in mid-October, reached almost 650 members within two months as numbers rocketed through lockdown 2. Swimmers say working from home has given people more time to enjoy simple pleasures and the sea allows a moment to step away from normal life in uncertain times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/23/bluetits-and-bluebells-essexs-open-water-swimmers-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

Ghislaine, who denies the charges, faces 35 years in jail if convicted.</p><p>Does he think she’s evil?

<p>There were no carols, no tree, no goose – but the Christmas I spent decorating my flat gave me the gift of peace</p><p>It was on a plank suspended between stepladders over a three-storey stairwell that I finally knew for sure that I was a grownup. I was slimed with wallpaper paste, grizzled with plaster dust, and 28 years old. Pet Shop Boys belted out of the radio and for the first time in my life I was free to spend Christmas doing exactly what I wanted – which was to make a home of the perversely vertical flat my husband and I had bought a year earlier.</p><p>I felt almost trippily alive – recklessly so, given the peril our first clumsy steps into home decoration involved. If we wanted to hang 12ft strips of wallpaper from a plank on top of two ladders, there was nobody to stop us. We were in it together, answerable only to ourselves. But for all that we remember it as one of our happiest times, the curious thing about the Christmas of 1987 is that, while we know Pet Shop Boys had the No 1 single, neither of us can remember a thing about what we ate or drank. It probably involved pizza and Indian takeaways, but all I can recall is the smell of sugar soap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/23/how-did-i-mourn-my-mother-with-pet-shop-boys-on-the-radio-and-plaster-dust-in-my-hair">Continue reading...</a>

He also won BBC Sports Personality of the Year this month and topped The Powerlist 2021, the annual list of the most influential people of African, African Caribbean and African American heritage in the UK.

Hamilton has encouraged his fellow drivers to back him by taking a knee before each race; convinced his team, Mercedes, to change its cars’ livery from silver to black; and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/21/lewis-hamilton-commission-increase-diversity-in-motor-sport-formula-one">set up a commission</a> to make the sport more diverse at all levels of employment – all the while showcasing the Black Lives Matter cause with a T-shirt and matching BLM face mask.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/23/how-lewis-hamilton-became-one-of-the-uks-top-sports-stars-and-activists">Continue reading...</a>
