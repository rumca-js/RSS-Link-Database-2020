LYRICS:
This world is full of killjoys who want to murder cheer
They deny Die Hard is a Christmas movies every single year

But Jack Torrance is Christmas chopping then relaxing in the snow 
Three Ninjas is basically a rip off of Home Alone
Gremlins in the blender made a festive green and red
And Martin Riggs bought Christmas trees with a gun up to his head

Every movie is a Christmas movie all it needs is snow
Or a dead terrorist without a machine gun ho ho ho ho
Mean Girls, Gremlins, Lethal Weapon, and Iron Man 3
Batman Returns, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Rent and Jumanji
All have Christmas trees, so they’re all Christmas movies 
Joy to the world

Freddy Kruger wore a Christmas Sweater
Then there’s Kiss Kiss Bang Bang
Every Shane Black movie is more Christmasy than a candy cane
Edward Scissorhands cutting ribbons with his thumb 
Groundhog day is too good for a holiday so dumb
And captain America had that winter soldier, hey that’s good enough

Every movie is a Christmas movie all it needs is snow
Or a dead terrorist without a machine gun ho ho ho ho
Mean Girls, Gremlins, Lethal Weapon, and Iron Man 3
Batman Returns, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Rent and Jumanji
All have Christmas trees, so they’re all Christmas movies 
Joy to the world your opinions are dumb
They’re all Christmas movies!
