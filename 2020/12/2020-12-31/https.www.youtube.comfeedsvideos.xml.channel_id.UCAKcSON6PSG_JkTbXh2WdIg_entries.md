Six years ago today, on Dec. 30, 2014, Brandi Carlile and her bandmates visited our studio to debut three songs from what was then their forthcoming album, "The Firewatcher's Daughter." It was a thrilling day, and looking back, it's a reminder of the magic that can happen during a studio session with artists. In honor of that occasion, here are three recordings of Carlile performing tracks from "The Firewatcher's Daughter," one in our studio from that December day six years ago, and two from the "Live From Here" archives.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Wherever Is Your Heart"
3:57 "The Eye"
7:39 "The Things I Regret"
