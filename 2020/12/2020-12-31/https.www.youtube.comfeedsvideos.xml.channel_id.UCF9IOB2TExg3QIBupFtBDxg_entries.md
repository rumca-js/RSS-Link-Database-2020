Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)

Oxford, 2 doses 4 to 12 weeks apart

Pfizer, 2 doses 3 to 12 weeks apart 

The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)

will protect the greatest number of at risk people overall

in the shortest possible time

and will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality, 

severe disease

and hospitalisations

and in protecting the NHS and equivalent health services.

second doses of both vaccines will be administered towards the end of the recommended vaccine dosing schedule of 12 weeks

The Green Book

If an interval longer than the recommended interval is left between doses, the second dose should still be given
(preferably using the same vaccine as was given for the first dose). 
The course does not need to be restarted. 
There is no evidence on the interchangeability of the COVID-19 vaccines although studies are underway. 
Therefore, every effort should be made to determine which vaccine the individual received and to complete with the same vaccine. 
There is no evidence of any safety concerns from vaccinating individuals with a past history of COVID-19 infection, or with detectable COVID-19 antibody.
