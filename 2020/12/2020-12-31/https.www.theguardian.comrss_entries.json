It was also a hilarious piece of academic self-parody, which concluded by regretting that neither the authors nor their publishers had recognised that \u201cthey had a bigger bestseller on their hands than even Malinowski\u2019s Sexual Life of Savages in NW Melanesia\u201d.

Yet Runciman had little time for disciplinary boundaries, and he ranged widely across the humanities and social sciences, publishing articles on topics as varied as the origins of states in ancient Greece, accelerating social mobility in Anglo-Saxon England, and charismatic legitimacy and one-party rule in Ghana.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/dec/31/viscount-runciman-of-doxford-obituary-wg-runciman-garry-runciman\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/dec/31/viscount-runciman-of-doxford-obituary-wg-runciman-garry-runciman", "date_published": "2020-12-31 15:38:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tell us about your best virtual travel experience of 2020 to win a \u00a3200 holiday prize", "description": "<p>You probably haven\u2019t travelled far lately, but if you\u2019ve had a fantastic virtual trip of some kind we want to hear about it.
