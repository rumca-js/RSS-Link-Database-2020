In honor of that occasion, here are three recordings of Carlile performing tracks from \"The Firewatcher's Daughter,\" one in our studio from that December day six years ago, and two from the \"Live From Here\" archives.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Wherever Is Your Heart\"\n3:57 \"The Eye\"\n7:39 \"The Things I Regret\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nBrandi Carlile\nPhil Hanseroth\nTim Hanseroth\nJosh Neumann\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Corey Schreppel; Sam Hudson\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; American Public Media\n\nFIND MORE:\n2012 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/06/27/brandicarlile-live\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/12/30/brandi-carlile-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2014 Guitar Collection interview:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/12/31/the-current-s-guitar-collection-brandi-carlile\n2018 at-home interview and performance with Brandi Carlile:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/03/07/music-at-home-with-brandi-carlile\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#brandicarlile", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8HqOO4dtgE", "date_published": "2020-12-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
