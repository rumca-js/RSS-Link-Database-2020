<p>The final round of 2020 had a 1-0 win for the leaders, Iago Aspas tearing opponents apart and Barça underwhelming</p><p>“We’ve had spectacular 2020,” said Koke Resurrección, which might not have fit the public mood exactly but maybe that was because there was still no public at all. There hadn’t been since the time they went to Liverpool nine months earlier, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/12/spanish-press-atletico-madrid-victory-liverpool-champions-league">a night so good</a> that Marcos Llorente got a puppy and <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/atletico-madrid/story/4074154/llorente-lives-up-to-family-legacy-in-madrid-except-hes-doing-it-for-atleticonot-real">called it Anfield</a>. Since then, there had been silence. The very next afternoon, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/16/the-doors-have-closed-on-la-liga-just-like-front-doors-all-over-spain">the doors closed</a>, staying that way for 93 days. And although they reopened <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/12/can-you-hear-the-drums-fernando-sevilla-triumph-on-silent-return">for the players</a>, sent into a strange, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/oct/01/were-robbing-everyone-la-liga-left-to-lament-lost-dressing-rooms">sterile new world</a>, they didn’t <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/10/la-liga-restart-preview-silent-seville-derby-kicks-off-spains-new-normal">for the people</a>, some of whom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/15/leganes-try-not-to-go-quietly-la-liga-returns-covid-19-ravaged-city">would never come back</a>. Some 264 games had been played in empty grounds in Spain’s first division alone and now here was Atlético’s captain on the penultimate day of the worst year, standing before another 68,456 empty seats.</p><p>There was no one there to see the message displayed on the giant screen way above his head, no one for the man it celebrated to lead, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/feb/19/diego-simeone-the-conductor-as-atletico-orchestra-finds-its-rhythm">as much conductor as coach</a>. Atlético Madrid’s final game of 2020 was Diego Simeone’s 500th as manager. “Incredible,” Koke called it. A lot has happened <a href="https://www.si.com/more-sports/2012/01/04/atletico-simeone">since he took over</a> in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2012/jan/16/diego-simeone-atletico-madrid-la-liga">January 2012</a>, and a lot has changed. The old place <a href="https://thttps//www.theguardian.com/football/2017/may/11/atletico-madrid-real-madrid-vincente-calderon">has gone</a> for a start, reduced to rubble <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/sep/18/a-stadium-called-wanda-opening-night-at-atletico-madrids-new-home">and replaced</a>. Real Madrid and Barcelona have been through seven managers each, Valencia have had 16. There may well never have been a coach who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/18/diego-simeone-atletico-madrid-chelsea">identified with</a> and changed a club like Simeone <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-primera-division/story/4001479/simeone-revolutionised-atletico-madrid-can-he-now-lead-the-clubs-evolution">changed Atlético</a>: so quickly, so completely, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/01/atletico-real-madrid-fans-thank-gods-prepare-historic-final">so lasting</a>. “He’s brought stability,” Koke said. He has brought success too. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/may/18/atletico-madrid-real-copa-del-rey">A Copa del Rey</a>, two Europa Leagues, two European Cup finals and one league title.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/dec/31/diego-simeone-500th-game-atletico-manager-la-liga-ends-familiarity-2020">Continue reading...</a>

This failure to face up to the threat posed by Israel’s horrific arsenal gives its prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, a sense of power and impunity, allowing Israel to dictate terms to others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/31/joe-biden-us-pretence-israel-nuclear-weapons">Continue reading...</a>

Sociologist, businessman and chair of the inquiry that led to the creation of the Criminal Cases Review Commission<p>In the spring of 1983, the London Review of Books published a review of The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook: The First Guide to What Really Matters in Life. It was deeply serious and learned, beautifully written and structured, and made a convincing case that the authors of the handbook were better at undertaking anthropological fieldwork than they were at engaging with sociological theory. It was also a hilarious piece of academic self-parody, which concluded by regretting that neither the authors nor their publishers had recognised that “they had a bigger bestseller on their hands than even Malinowski’s Sexual Life of Savages in NW Melanesia”. It was scarcely coincidence that the review was published on the first of April. And it was equally unsurprising that the author of this sparkling piece was WG Runciman, the distinguished sociologist, who has died aged 86.</p><p>Runciman’s magnum opus was A Treatise on Social Theory (1983-97), a trilogy that sought to marry theoretical analysis and empirical observation, to demonstrate the appropriateness of this methodology by offering in the final volume a sociological history of 20th-century Britain, and to reinvigorate a subject that seemed to have lost its way. Yet Runciman had little time for disciplinary boundaries, and he ranged widely across the humanities and social sciences, publishing articles on topics as varied as the origins of states in ancient Greece, accelerating social mobility in Anglo-Saxon England, and charismatic legitimacy and one-party rule in Ghana.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/dec/31/viscount-runciman-of-doxford-obituary-wg-runciman-garry-runciman">Continue reading...</a>

Co-creator of Spitting Image and graphic designer who transformed broadcast branding<p>Martin Lambie-Nairn, who has died aged 75, broke new ground in branding television networks and commercial goods and services. His idents – moving logos shown between programmes – to identify the BBC and Channel 4 in the UK were so hugely popular that they even received fan mail for their wit and originality.</p><p>An early adopter of computer animation, Martin used it to create the bold and colourful “animated blocks” identity for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R86_TLuI51w" title="">the launch of Channel 4 in 1982</a>. Advertisers quickly saw the potential of involving Martin in numerous popular campaigns, including those for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4yBZy4u66M" title="">Smarties</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp0BCxNrx04" title="">Hamlet Cigars</a>, the latter a parody of the Channel 4 ident, with its blocks not coming together properly until settling into a resigned but contented cigar-smoking face.

<p>Making the statement signing of Mana Iwabuchi was a proud moment as sporting director and I am excited about 2021 </p><p>Last Monday Aston Villa Women announced the signing of Mana Iwabuchi, the 27-year-old Japan international and World Cup winner. This was a statement signing for a club in our first season in the WSL, the culmination of a process I’d been working on since the summer, and the moment the deal was concluded has to go down as a highlight of my short career so far as a sporting director.</p><p>Villa’s head coach Gemma Davies and I share an admiration and respect for Japanese women’s football and its players past and present. I was fortunate to benefit from the footballing artistry of Japanese legends when playing with Aya Miyama at St Louis Athletica in the USA and Yuki Nagasato during my time at Chelsea, players who, like Mana, displayed the precision and grace that are part of the DNA of Japanese women’s football.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/31/aston-villa-my-crazy-challenging-first-year-has-ended-on-a-high">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bold predictions have been dampened by the pandemic but hopes for Team GB remain high as this Olympic year dawns, for a second time</p><p>Deep inside the UK Sport offices in central London there is a secret wall, accessible to only the most senior figures, on which the performances of every potential Team GB medal prospect are tracked and scrutinised. Normally, if it was seven months out from an Olympics, that wall – in a room called the performance lab – would be a hive of activity. Instead it looks like the Mary Celeste.</p><p>“I’ve not been in that room since last March, so I don’t know whether the wall has a nice layer of dust or is being brushed down by the one person who still checks the office,” the UK Sport chair, Katherine Grainger, says. “I think it’s fair to say that there’s probably more question marks going into a Games than we’ve ever had.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/31/team-gb-delayed-tokyo-olympic-games">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Did I waste one of the great self-improvement opportunities of my life playing video games, getting into craft beer and cleaning the bathroom too much?</p><p>‘Look at this,” I say to my girlfriend. “Pretty cool, right?” I am slowly rubbing a mildly abrasive product called Bar Keeper’s Friend into the white worktop of our kitchen counter, eradicating an almost invisible stain. “It’s mildly abrasive, I guess,” I continue, when she says nothing. “You remember that coffee ring?” Silence.</p><p>Seven weeks into the first lockdown, my girlfriend and I have nothing left to say to one another. Every possible human experience that has occurred in this flat over the past two and a half months has been vocalised, analysed and wrung dry. One night before bed, she pleaded: “Say something to me!” and, in desperation, I started talking about a podcast I had listened to earlier in the day, but one I couldn’t remember entirely, so I spent 20 minutes roughly explaining the concept of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/nikola-tesla">Nikola Tesla</a> before falling asleep. In comparison, ushering her to the kitchen to watch me almost remove a coffee stain is a vast improvement. “It’ll probably need another going over, but …” I trail off. “How much was it?” she asks. I’m electrified by the chance at having something new to say. “It was two pounds and 99 pence.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/31/this-year-i-achieved-nothing-all-i-discovered-were-the-limits-of-my-unambition">Continue reading...</a>

The first half of 2020 was, as Jean-Jacques Guiony of the world’s largest luxury brands conglomerate LVMH, said, “a perfectly negative alignment of planets” for the fashion industry. The cancellation of events, weddings and parties in every market created an economic, logistical and cultural worst-case scenario for fashion.</p><p>Even a strong bounce back in China in the second half of the year has not come close to helping the balance sheet. A recent report by the Business of Fashion website and the management consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Company marks 2020 as the worst year on record for the fashion industry, forecasting a 90% decline in profits and a 15-30% fall in sales, compared with 2019.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/dec/31/2020-the-year-that-changed-fashion-and-not-just-the-look">Continue reading...</a>

From that point onwards, I have been locked in a one-man culture war against homebodies, irrationally furious that someone, somewhere, might be enjoying having more time to spend curled up under the duvet with a peppermint tea and a page-turner, or whatever it is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/02/for-introverts-lockdown-is-a-chance-to-play-to-our-strengths">introverts like to do</a>.</p><p>This has come to a head in December, where everywhere I look I see people announcing their glib indifference to the fact that one of the best nights of the year, New Year’s Eve, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/30/from-witchy-rituals-to-sobbing-on-the-floor-how-will-you-spend-new-years-eve-open-thread">has been cancelled</a>.

<p>Butterflies with Mariah, Bronski Beat in the Peak District, Snoop Dogg on a food delivery ad … our writers reveal the tracks that made 2020 bearable</p><p>When it came to lockdown comfort listening, there was something particularly appealing about lush symphonic soul made by artists such as Teddy Pendergrass and the Delfonics. But there was one record I reached for repeatedly: Black Moses by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/isaachayes">Isaac Hayes</a>, and particularly the tracks arranged by Dale Warren. Their version of Burt Bacharach’s (They Long to Be) Close to You is an epic, spinning the original classic into a nine-minute dose of saccharine soul. But their cover of Going in Circles, another Warren exercise in expansion, is their masterpiece, reimagining the Friends of Distinction original as a seven-minute arrangement with stirring strings and beatific backing vocals that builds into a story about lost love that transcends the genre’s usual parameters. A perfect, if slightly meta, balm for the repetitive lockdown blues. <em>Lanre Bakare</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/31/all-that-mattered-was-survival-the-songs-that-got-us-through-2020">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After two arthroscopic knee surgeries and a year away from tennis the 39-year-old is showing remarkable grit to continue</p><p>In July 2018, during times when rooms could still be safely filled with people, Roger Federer was at Wimbledon for a pre-tournament press conference as he prepared to defend his title. For half an hour he fielded questions in three languages from a packed room, but suddenly things took a left turn. An unfamiliar reporter was handed the microphone and without missing a beat, she opened her question with a simple, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1yphO7RnDo&amp;t=7m0s">direct statement</a>: “You look even more handsome than last year.”</p><p>As onlookers cackled and Federer responded with a timely injection of humour, that cringe-inducing moment felt as if it was a reflection of the way Federer is discussed in general. Even before he marked himself as one of the all-time greats, Federer took on a mythical status in the sporting world. He is the maestro. He is peRFect. He is often described as some otherworldly being. There are those interminable jokes from commentators about his inability to sweat, even when his headband is clearly soaked through. Such a comment from a professional journalist seemed as if it was a natural progression.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/dec/31/roger-federer-perfect-excuse-walk-away-2020-wants-to-go-on-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a young woman, I spent many happy hours in a choir. In my 40s, even the sound of one would make me sad</p><p>I resolved to do something about the lack of singing in my life two years ago when a friend invited me to a performance of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/16/handels-messiah-classic-appeal-christmas">Handel’s Messiah</a> and I found myself replying: “I think it would make me too sad.”</p><p>I knew I would be sad, because it happened every time I heard a choir, especially at Christmas. If I caught the Nine Lessons and Carols or heard a snatch of any Messiah chorus, I was gripped by a painful nostalgia for singing and for the feeling of being part of the living, harmonising organism that is a choir. I sounded, I realised, absurd. It <em>was</em> absurd: nothing was stopping me from going back to singing other than my own fears.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/31/twenty-years-ago-nerves-stopped-me-singing-in-public-could-i-get-my-voice-back">Continue reading...</a>
