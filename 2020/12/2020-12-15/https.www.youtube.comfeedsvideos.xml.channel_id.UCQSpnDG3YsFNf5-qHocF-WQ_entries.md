It doesn't actually take much to become an "expert" at computers that can basically solve any computer or tech problem you come across. The big secret for every IT professional is not that they already know how to fix computers, but rather they are just good at Googling for the answer! In this video, we go over a few techniques on how to essentially find the solution to any problem by searching for terms that are most likely to return solutions other people have come up with about the same issue. With a bit of practice, you may never need to get tech support again!
