-----------------------
You find yourself in a new profession, making money as a con man.

Scams come and go, what made money yesterday may not work today but even though the rackets are constantly changing, the mind of a con artist stays the same. 

Almost everything in society is ripe with exploit points for us to profit off of. There’s lottery scams, IRS scams, investment scams, romance scams, charity scams and many more! 

When it comes to picking your target it’s about how easily you can manipulate their emotions to get them to trust you. Once you have your target, now it’s time to put the scam into play.

In general, you’re gonna want to find the weakest link. Which is probably gonna be a low wage worker that isn’t gonna care to double check things or someone working on commission, that is incentivized to “overlook” certain discrepancies in order to close the sale.

While the scam is going on, you want to make sure you look the part. If your racket is getting phony mortgages for example, you want to look clean cut and have all the bank statements and such to back yourself up.

The best con artists are just amazing salesmen. You wanna use that persuasive tonality and body language to get them under your spell.

And there you have it! And just like when a business starts taking off, it’s gonna be pretty exhilarating, addicting, and you’ll want to scale up. The biggest temptation of a criminal is that when things start to heat up, it’s always “oh just one more hit, just one more job, just one more ruse and I’ll be done!” 
Back in the days, con artists had to go face-to-face with the people they were ripping off. But today, most scams are done online, over long distances.
