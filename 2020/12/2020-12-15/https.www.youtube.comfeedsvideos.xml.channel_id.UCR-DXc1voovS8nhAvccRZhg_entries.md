The King of Ding!

This is a quick video I made to show how I built the 'Raspberry Pi Bell Slapper'. The full details about the project—and how you can build one of your own—are in this open source project on GitHub:

https://github.com/geerlingguy/pi-bell-slapper

Let me know if you like these kinds of projects and I'll try to record and publish videos about more of them! I usually don't set up a camera or document things as much on these quick one-off projects, but if you like this video, I'll try to do more :)

Things I used to make the bell slapper project (affiliate links):

  - MG90S Micro Servos: https://amzn.to/2I6sZSC
  - 3.38" diameter call bell: https://amzn.to/3iCUL5F
  - Raspberry Pi A+ (original model)
  - Various pieces of scrap wood
  - 4 wood screws
  - Velcro (to mount the Pi to the wood)
  - Cut piece of scrap sheet metal (for the slapper arm)
