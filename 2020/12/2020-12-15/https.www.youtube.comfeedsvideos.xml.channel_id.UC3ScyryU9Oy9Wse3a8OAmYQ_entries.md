How did this American mother go from a comfortable life in Indiana to the heart of ISIS’s self-declared caliphate in Syria, with her husband a sniper for the terror group and her 10-year-old son forced to threaten President Donald Trump in an ISIS propaganda video shown around the world? FRONTLINE tells the inside story in "Return From ISIS," a documentary in association with the BBC that has been nearly four years in the making. Watch the opening scene now, in which journalist Josh Baker visits with Sam's sister, Lori -- who has received a desperate email from Sam pleading for help.
