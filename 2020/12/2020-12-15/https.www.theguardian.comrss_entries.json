The mischievous trio discuss their story so far</p><p>When they began staging shows for children, the all-female <a href=\"https://www.filskittheatre.com/\">Filskit theatre company</a> commonly heard two questions. But what will happen when you have babies? And wouldn\u2019t you rather be making proper theatre? Ten years on, the award-winning trio are busy presenting two new productions this month: an interactive online jamboree, <a href=\"https://www.filskittheatre.com/margot\">Margot\u2019s Magical Winter Wonder Party</a>, and a new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/video/2020/dec/10/watch-huddle-a-tale-of-two-penguins-video\">film</a> adapted from their penguin tale, Huddle. With one Filskit baby born already, and two more due next year, the company is adapting to their changing lives, but that\u2019s always been part of the process for this nimble operation co-run by best friends Victoria Dyson, Sarah Shephard and Katy Costigan.</p><p>The \u201cproper theatre\u201d charge still rankles. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard that phrase more times than we\u2019d care to remember,\u201d says Shephard, when we all meet on Zoom. \u201cI think it\u2019s a lack of understanding of the sector.\u201d In the last decade, the quality and status of work for young audiences has significantly improved, but many still base their assumptions on their own childhood experiences of theatre. That might have been a trip to the panto or a \u201ctheatre-in-education company coming to your school to do a show about highway safety\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/15/filskit-theatre-margots-magical-winter-wonder-play\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/15/filskit-theatre-margots-magical-winter-wonder-play", "date_published": "2020-12-15 10:29:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "London property owner Shaftesbury swings to \u00a3700m loss amid Covid crisis", "description": "<p>Landlord hit by fall in income from properties in Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/shaftesbury\">Shaftesbury</a>, one of the biggest landlords in central London, has slumped to a \u00a3700m loss after slashing the value of its portfolio, as the West End braces for tougher Covid-19 restrictions.</p><p>The company, which owns parts of Chinatown, Soho and Covent Garden, has been hit by the sharp fall in the number of tourists and office workers coming into the capital.

That day, a team led by Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang at Fudan University in Shanghai sequenced the genetic code of the virus behind Wuhan\u2019s month-long pneumonia outbreak. The process took about 40 hours. Having analysed the code, Zhang reported back to the Ministry of Health. The pathogen was a novel coronavirus similar to Sars, the deadly virus that sparked an epidemic in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\" title=\"\">2003</a>. People should take precautions, he warned.</p><p>The Chinese government had imposed an embargo on information about the outbreak and Zhang and his co-workers were under pressure not to publish the code. The blackout couldn\u2019t hold. On 8 January, news broke about the nature of the pathogen and was confirmed a day later by Chinese authorities.

When we <a href=\"http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/covid-19_and_human_development_0.pdf\">look closely</a> at these figures, we see something else too: two months afterwards, mortality had risen sharply for the lowest socioeconomic group, somewhat for the middle group, and least for the highest group. A huge external shock had thrust the underlying inequalities in society into sharp relief.</p><p>So it has been with Covid-19. Inequalities in health, and in the social conditions that lead to ill health, have been revealed and amplified by the pandemic and the response to it. Now, with vaccines coming onstream, there is talk of Britain getting back to \u201cnormal\u201d. But the \u201cnormal\u201d that existed in February 2020 is not acceptable.
