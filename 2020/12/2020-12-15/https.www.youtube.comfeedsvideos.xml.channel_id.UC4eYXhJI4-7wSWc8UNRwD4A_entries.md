The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

For this Tiny Desk (home) concert, we pay a visit to the doctor's office. Actually, the venue is called Rare Violins of New York and it's something of a second home to cellist Jan Vogler, who pops in frequently to have the experts give his 1708 Stradivarius cello a thorough checkup. If your multi-million-dollar fiddle has a cough or the sniffles, or even needs a full-blown restoration, Rare Violins, which sits just a block away from Carnegie Hall, can help. The firm also has a lovely music room, kitted out with a fine piano – something Vogler lacks at his place.

With help from the fine pianist Alessio Bax, Vogler makes a convincing case for Beethoven as one of the great heroes of the cello. Beethoven, whose 250th birthday falls this week, wrote five cello sonatas, plus other works for the instrument, which, before his time, was primarily relegated to beefing up the bass line in various chamber music situations.

Beethoven, in essence, liberated the cello. Listen to how it dances and struts in the opening scherzo from the Sonata in A, Op. 69, and how it sings sweetly in slow section from the 12 Variations on a Theme from Handel's Judas Maccabaeus, from early in the composer's career. And finally there's the opening to Beethoven's last cello sonata, which Bax — whose role is far more than just an accompanist here — says is compact with emotion, yet "stretches the boundaries" for the instrument.

SET LIST
Beethoven: Cello Sonata in A, Op. 69: II. Scherzo
Beethoven: 12 Variations on a Theme from Handel's Judas Maccabaeus: Variation XI: Adagio
Beethoven: Cello Sonata in D, Op. 102: I. Allegro con brio

Tom Huizenga | December 15, 2020
After the pandemic hit and musicians migrated online to share their performances, Nicholas Kitchen, the first violinist of the Borromeo String Quartet, built a little "concert shell" in his Boston-area loft he calls "MusicKitchen." It's a practice space for the group which he shares with his wife, the Borromeo's cellist Yeesun Kim. Like the shells in regular concert spaces, but on a tinier scale, the Kitchen shell (seen behind the players in this video) helps project the sound. And the sounds Kitchen wants to emphasize in this concert come by way of Beethoven, the composer born 250 years ago this week.

Beethoven doesn't score high when it comes to positive personality traits. Paranoid, litigious and a micromanager, Beethoven didn't suffer fools and often fought with friends. Still, he possessed a well-developed funny bone, which Nicholas Kitchen and company put on display here, along with their own whimsical tiny "desks." Because of the virus, and the confined space, the players wear masks.

The humorous side of Beethoven's personality seeps into his music, such as the false stops and musical giggles that fuel his two-minute-long Presto from the Quartet Op. 130, which opens this performance. For contrast, the Borromeos follow with a serious movement from later on in the same piece, the prayerful Cavatina, which Beethoven said even got him choked up. More hijinks ensue in the Vivace from the Quartet in F, Op. 135, where Kitchen says the music becomes "completely berserk." And finally, in the last movement of the same quartet, Beethoven inserts a musical inside joke, the brunt of which falls on a wealthy music lover who displeased the great composer by not showing up at an important concert.

Grumpy or gleeful, raging or reflective, Beethoven's music endures for everyone in these compelling performances.

SET LIST
Beethoven: String Quartet in B-flat, Op. 130, II. Presto
Beethoven: String Quartet in B-flat, Op. 130, V. Cavatina
Beethoven: String Quartet in F, Op. 135, II. Presto
Beethoven: String Quartet in F, Op. 135, IV. Der schwer gefasste Entschluss
