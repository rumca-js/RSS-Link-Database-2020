Last Friday, Dec. 11, Swedish band Peter Bjorn and John released a new EP, "Endless Play." It's a follow-up to their March full-length release, "Endless Dream." The band — comprising Peter Morén, Bjorn Yttling and John Eriksson — last visited The Current studio in 2009, and they likely would have visited The Current in 2020 had it not been for the pandemic. Nevertheless, we'll honor Peter Bjorn and John today by looking back on two songs they performed in our studio back in 2007. Get ready to whistle along! 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Young Folks"
5:03 "Let's Call It Off"

PERSONNEL
Peter Morén – vocals, guitar, whistling
Bjorn Yttling – piano, backing vocals 
John Eriksson – drums, shaker, backing vocals
