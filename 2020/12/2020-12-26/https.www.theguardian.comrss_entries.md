## Arsenal relieve pressure on manager Mikel Arteta with win over Chelsea

<p>To put the scale of this shock result into some sort of context, Arsenal had been able to score four goals in their previous 10 Premier League matches – a sequence that had brought them five points. It had the club mired in their worst start to a season since 1974-75 and the manager, Mikel Arteta, in crisis. One of the big pre-match questions asked whether Arsenal were in a relegation battle.</p><p>This was a restorative result and performance, with Arteta’s bold team selection returning a rich dividend. He gave first league appearances of the season to Pablo Marí and Emile Smith Rowe and a first start in the competition this time out to Gabriel Martinelli. Smith Rowe emerged with honours, driving from his No 10 role.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/26/arsenal-chelsea-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The novelist and screenwriter on working on the BBC drama series Small Axe, why rejection is an inevitable rite of passage, and what he’s reading to his kids</p><p>Courttia Newland, 47, grew up in west London and published his first novel, <em>The Scholar: A West-Side Story</em>, aged 23, earning critical praise for his portrayal of a teenager’s life in the inner city. Since then he’s written seven more books and eight plays, winning numerous awards for work that ranges from detective fiction to Greek tragedy. In 2000, he co-edited the anthology <em>IC3: The Penguin Book of New Black Writing in Britain</em><em> </em>and, as a screenwriter, he recently collaborated with film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/steve-mcqueen-edits-the-observer-new-review">Steve McQueen</a> on two acclaimed episodes of the BBC drama series Small Axe. He’s now preparing for the publication of two new works of speculative fiction: <em>A River Called Time</em>, a novel,<em> </em>and <em>Cosmogramma</em>, a collection of short stories, both to be published by Canongate in 2021.</p><p><strong>What inspired you to write a book about astral projection?<br /></strong>It sounds bizarre but I’ll just say it. When I was growing up I used to have these episodes where you wake up and feel like you can’t breathe, you can’t see, you’re almost having a seizure, a dreaming seizure. I’d fight it and try to wake up – but this one time, around 1997, I didn’t fight it and I had an out of body experience, like I actually rose from my body. I could see somebody in the room sitting next to the bed. The experience stuck in my head and I thought, “Let me find out what’s been happening.” I found all these books saying it was astral projection. And that was it. I knew I wanted to write about astral projection.<strong> </strong>I actually started the book in 2002.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/26/courttia-newland-were-battering-down-barricades">Continue reading...</a>

Villa led through Bertrand Traoré’s fifth-minute goal when Tyrone Mings was sent off after receiving two yellow cards in quick succession shortly before half-time. But the hosts were much the better side after the break as well and wrapped up a 3-0 win with goals from Kortney Hause and Anwar El Ghazi.</p><p>Watkins was a thorn in Palace’s side throughout and was involved in all three goals as well as hitting a post late on.

<p>(New West)<br />Steve Earle reprises 10 songs by his son Justin Townes Earle, who died earlier this year of a drugs overdose</p><p>“It’s the only way I knew to say goodbye,” says <a href="http://www.steveearle.com/">Steve Earle</a> of this album honouring his late son, Justin Townes Earle, a talented singer-songwriter from the same mould as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jun/14/steve-earle-so-you-wanna-be-an-outlaw-interview">his famous father</a>: the same mix of Americana influences, the same wearied twang to his vocals, the same inspired way with a lyric. Sadly, too, the same dysfunctional family history, which meant that in boyhood Justin saw little of his father, with his teens quickly curdling into rebellion and substance abuse. In and out of addiction,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/aug/24/justin-townes-earle-us-songwriter-and-son-of-steve-earle-dies-aged-38"> in August</a> this year “JT” fell foul of a cocaine/fentanyl overdose, aged 38.</p><p>Earle reprises 10 of his son’s songs <a href="http://newwst.com/sejtWE">here</a>, including early material such as Pine Hill, usually described as formative, but which emerges as bright as more praised later work. Justin used a sparer musical palette than Earle Sr, often with a rockabilly feel – the celebrated Harlem River Blues, for example – but the Dukes, a tough, road-worn outfit, tend to iron out their variety. Earle’s vocals, growling and gravelled these days, deliver the songs straight, only occasionally letting a sense of loss intrude. His own song Last Words is hushed and harrowing, taking comfort that the final words between father and son were “I love you”. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/26/steve-earle-and-the-dukes-jt-review-a-fathers-fond-farewell">Continue reading...</a>

When the pedals started going faster than her legs, she screeched, her eyes widened, and then she toppled sideways.</p><p>“Exerciser”, I should add, is a term I’ve coined myself.

Compared with previous vaccines, the process has been very fast and so, naturally, people are asking how can it have happened without some kind of compromise on standards and care. Explaining it all as simply a result of the wonders of the latest scientific advances seems vague. So how has it actually come about? In reality, there are at least 10 reasons: some are about good planning, some good science and some just good luck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/26/ten-reasons-we-got-covid-19-vaccines-so-quickly-without-cutting-corners">Continue reading...</a>

## Hancock's Half Hour reminds us what once united Britain: laughing at each other | Zoe Williams

<p>In the 1950s radio comedy, implacable differences of opinion just create a society full of people it’s enjoyable to laugh at </p><p>Plenty of people will remember <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b009t2ld/episodes/player">Hancock’s Half Hour</a> from when it first aired in 1954, and then there is the generation who know it because it reminds us of our dads. As far as I know, the line stops there: at least, I’ve never been able to curate this comedy gold in such a way as to endear it to my own offspring. I’m talking about the radio version, of course, which is better, because radio is.</p><p>When it launched, Hancock had a silly, romping spirit, in the fashion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_That_Man_Again">It’s That Man Again </a>or <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0072vdz/episodes/player">The Goon Show</a>. The postwar years were very gentle on themselves, comedically speaking; it often felt as though they couldn’t cope with much edge, which after the mid-century carnage is fair enough. By the show’s end in 1961, it was a completely different experience, a rumination on the human condition. I raise all this not to keep the flame alive at a sentimental time of year – well, that too – but because we have, for at least the past five years, and intensely during 2020, come to think of ourselves as a nation experiencing a sudden breach: always on the brink of a fresh culture war, inexplicably separated in our sensibilities and beliefs by chasms that cannot possibly be overcome by goodwill alone. And the more I listen to Hancock’s Half Hour, the more I think, that’s completely wrong.

## I’ve enjoyed talking to celebrities from my bed. Will I want to do it in person again? | Hadley Freeman

<p>Some of the greatest experiences of my life happened when interviewing famous people face-to-face, but now I’ve discovered the joys of duvet working days</p><p>One of my favourite things about Britain is Boxing Day. In the US, we don’t have a name for the day after Christmas, which is insane because it has such a distinctive feel to it, it so obviously deserves its own nomenclature. Moving here and discovering Boxing Day was like finding out there’s a specific name for 7pm on a Sunday, or 5pm on a Friday, as there absolutely should be, and Germany probably has this covered.</p><p>This week, as regular readers know, is my favourite of the year, and not entirely because it’s when, as Bridget Jones once put it, “normal service is suspended and it’s OK to lie in bed as long as you want, put anything into your mouth and drink alcohol whenever it should chance to pass your way, even in the mornings”. It’s also a time to take stock of how the year has gone, and how the next one will look. For a while, the future seemed unfathomable. Now that the vaccines are a-coming, that’s not quite the case – but my job is still slightly lost in the fathoms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/26/ive-enjoyed-talking-to-celebrities-from-my-bed-will-i-want-to-do-it-in-person-again">Continue reading...</a>

## Charlie Brooker: ‘There’s a certain release in laughing into the abyss’

<p>Black Mirror co-creators Brooker and Annabel Jones discuss new comedy special Death to 2020, and the importance of being silly in the face of disaster <br /></p><p>I<strong> </strong>have been uncharacteristically optimistic this year,” Charlie Brooker says cheerfully from his west London living room, a prop sign from Black Mirror’s Bandersnatch episode behind him. “Partly because I’ve always been a pessimist and feared the worst. Suddenly, I don’t have to worry about the worst happening, because it’s happening. I think being a neurotic, worrisome person has slightly prepared me for it. After swine flu, I wouldn’t touch a door handle for about a year.”</p><p>There are other reasons for his unusual levels of cheer. Considering that a global pandemic has resided for years in Brooker’s buzzing mental database of potential catastrophes, he has not had a bad 2020. In May, he hosted the BBC’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/14/charlie-brooker-antiviral-wipe-review-urgent-exasperated-perfection">Antiviral Wipe</a>, the first network comedy show to be made about (and under) lockdown. In July, Broke and Bones, the new production company launched by Brooker and his long-time creative partner Annabel Jones, announced a Netflix deal that extends far beyond its breakthrough hit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/06/every-episode-of-black-mirror-ranked-charlie-brooker">Black Mirror</a>. The pair are opening their account with Death to 2020, a one-off (obviously) about the rotten year that was. As Leslie Jones, one of several A-list guests, says in the trailer: “I’d say it was a trainwreck and a shitshow but that would be unfair to trains and shit.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/26/netflix-death-to-2020-charlie-brooker">Continue reading...</a>
