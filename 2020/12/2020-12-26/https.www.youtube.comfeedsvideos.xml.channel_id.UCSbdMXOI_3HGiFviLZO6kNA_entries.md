Hello! Here's an updated video that I think will be useful for all of the new VR users after this holiday season. I've picked up a bunch of tips and tricks of what you should do (and not do) with your new VR headset. Whether you have been in VR for 1 minute or 3 years I think you can find something useful here. Also whether you're a Quest 2 user or an Index user, same story.
