The Nazgûl are the greatest of Sauron's servants.  Today, we track their lives and travels from their time as mortal men to their downfall with their master.  Their actions before and during the War of the Ring affect many in Middle-earth.  Everywhere they go, they strike fear and dread into the hearts of mortals.
