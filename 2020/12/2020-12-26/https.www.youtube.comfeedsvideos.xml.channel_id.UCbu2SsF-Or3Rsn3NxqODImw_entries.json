Multiplayer has always been the main focus with Infinity Ward and Treyarch, among other studios, leveraging different design styles around maps, guns, killstreaks, and perks. In this video we are going to take a look at some of the biggest blunders developers have tried throughout the series when it comes to perks.\n\nPerks were first introduced in Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, giving players the opportunity to customize their loadouts beyond what weapons they could carry. Some of these would buff your weapons, impact how you interface with killstreaks, stave off death, or kill unsuspecting (and soon-to-be-frustrated) players--as anyone who has been killed by a Martyrdom grenade can attest. Over the years, players have been frustrated by Juggernaut, Commando, Danger Close, Martyrdom, Last Stand, Stopping Power, and a number of others that have been introduced.\n\nSubsequent games have modified or removed many of these problematic perks (after doubling down on them, in at least one case) and continue to experiment with new perks and the ways in which they can be equipped. We continue to see adjustments made to both 2020\u2019s Black Ops Cold War and Warzone, and while we\u2019re always hoping for the best, the next annoying perk is always just around the corner. Let\u2019s just hope Last Stand never comes back.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui5hKCQ9S3U", "date_published": "2020-12-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Every GameSpot Game Of The Year (1996-2020)", "description": "GameSpot has been around for a very long time, here is a video with every game we have every awarded with GameSpot's Game of the Year.\n\nSince the late '90s, GameSpot has awarded Game of the Year to the one game each year that stood above the rest.
