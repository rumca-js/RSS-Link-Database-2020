Night City is a dangerous place. If you aren’t well equipped your journey to becoming a legend could end before it even begins. In this video we’re going to explain the benefit of iconic weapons, where to find them, and how to upgrade them.

Cyberpunk 2077's tiered loot system can be confusing at first glance. Like most RPGs, it offers weapons of various rarity, from common to legendary, but separate from its rarity is whether or not the weapon is iconic. 

While you can find epic and even legendary weapons scattered around the place throughout your journey through Night City, iconic weapons are much harder to come by and require a little more effort to use effectively. In the above video, we explain the benefit of using iconic weapons, the best places to find iconic weapons, and how to upgrade them.

Cyberpunk 2077 is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Stadia. For more tips for CD Projekt Red's latest, make sure to subscribe to youtube.com/GameSpot.
