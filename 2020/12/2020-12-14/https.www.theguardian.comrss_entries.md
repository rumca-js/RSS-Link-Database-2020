<p>Even three years out, France 2023 promises much with the hosts among the contenders looking to topple the Springboks<br /></p><p>If the 2023 Rugby World Cup proves as multidimensional as the gloriously unpredictable pool draw anything could happen in France in three years’ time. From Christian Louboutin revealing he is looking to design rugby boots with his trademark red soles and a top ballerina discussing oval-ball choreography, there really was something for <em>tout le monde</em> to enjoy.</p><p>The best moment, though, came when the three-star Michelin chef Guy Savoy was invited to draw the top-seeded team in the hosts’ pool and picked out the ball with New Zealand’s name on it. If the organisers want to launch their tournament with some serious panache, an opening night clash between <em>Les Bleus</em> and the All Blacks would be a decent place to start.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/14/rugby-union-world-cup-draw-france-2023-preview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thanks to sweet and hopeful exchanges in stores across the country, the special bonds forged between independent retailers and customers will outlast the pandemic</p><p>Local shopkeepers have had many reasons to despair this year. The pandemic has brought unimaginable levels of uncertainty and financial pressure. However, amid the despair, there have also been moments of hope. Moments that have convinced shopkeepers to carry on, or just moments that have made them smile. Many of these were thanks to the special relationships that have been forged between local shops and customers. And each moment highlights just how much it means to businesses when we choose to shop locally.</p><p>“There have actually been several standout moments,” says Barry Whitehouse, who owns The Artery art shop in Banbury, Oxfordshire. When the first lockdown began, The Artery started offering<strong> </strong>free online art classes. “We’ve been so touched by the feedback from all over the world,” he says. “The lessons we gave during the first lockdown have had more than 14,000 views, and we now have people worldwide joining in our regular online classes or free monthly demonstrations.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/visa-where-you-shop-matters/2020/dec/14/her-smile-made-it-all-worth-the-effort-local-shopkeepers-on-their-most-memorable-moments-of-2020">Continue reading...</a>

Notice all the photographers scrabbling for the perfect shot, the ecstatic man in the striped shirt confronting the topless hero, and even the big sombrero popping into frame on the right – it’s a scene rich with eccentric characters revelling in a moment of footballing history. Pelé’s gravity-defying header against Italy in the 19th minute of the final had set Brazil en route to an emphatic 4-1 win – and their third world title in 12 years – while his nonchalant pass to Carlos Alberto, who lashed home the fourth goal four minutes from time, showcased the Seleção at their most irresistible. Some had suggested prior to the tournament that Pelé was past his peak and unbefitting of a place in such a star-studded squad. How wrong they were.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/14/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-pele-is-lifted-skywards-in-world-cup-glory">Continue reading...</a>

I then use a treatment serum, always choosing one that contains plumping hyaluronic acid. The powerhouse of the beauty world, serums contain lots of active ingredients that penetrate quickly and deeply into skin. If a spot goes nuclear it can leave skin with hyperpigmentation – as can sun exposure – so I also use vitamin C to brighten my complexion.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/skincare-gets-gutsy/2020/dec/14/how-to-get-radiant-healthy-looking-skin-six-answers-from-beauty-experts">Continue reading...</a>

But a year ago it lost some of its most prized seats to the Conservatives – and so far voters appear to have few regrets</p><p>Exactly a year ago this past weekend, the Conservatives won a thumping majority by taking seats across the midlands and north of England. These constituencies had once been so safe for Labour that they had come to be known as the ‘red wall’. But in recent years there were ominous signs that support for the party was faltering. The Brexit referendum was the first time many broke with Labour and then on December 12 2019, the red wall crumbled. </p><p>One brick to fall was Leigh in Greater Manchester, a place that had voted solidly Labour since 1922. <strong>Helen Pidd </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that as part of a five-year reporting project she has been following voters in the town to gauge their current sentiments about the government they helped elect. Despite a torrid year and a looming Brexit crisis, she finds few willing to express regrets about switching their votes. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/14/has-labour-lost-its-red-wall-forever">Continue reading...</a>

<p><a href="https://hundredheroines.org/">Hundred+ Heroines</a> is the only UK charity dedicated to advancing public awareness of women in photography. Today the organisation is adding to its roster a further 50 inspiring women photographers, seven of whom we showcase here, whose work is assessed as pushing boundaries and breaking new ground</p><p>In 2018, to mark the centenary of the act that paved the way to universal suffrage in the UK, the Royal Photographic Society ran a campaign to identify outstanding female photographers from around the world. Nearly 5,000 were nominated, and a final 100 were selected. The independent charity Hundred+ Heroines was founded by Del Barrett, previously vice president of the RPS, to amplify their influence, and to seek to establish them as household names. The organisation is committed to challenging the under-representation of women in photography, and to encouraging a wider public interest in their work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/14/hundred-heroines-outstanding-female-photographers-around-world-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Sadler’s Wells, London<br /></strong>The audience whoop behind their masks at a muted, Covid-era iteration of the festival, ending with a note of hope</p><p>Compared with the annual Breakin’ Convention festival, this was always going to be a different beast, a socially distanced hour in the theatre instead of a noisy, crowded, all-weekend event with people dancing in the foyers. It is impossible to match that atmosphere, but if anyone was going to have a go it is Jonzi D, Breakin’ Convention’s artistic director and indefatigable MC, who has the audience whooping behind their masks.</p><p>The evening features three acts and two films (screening while they deep-clean behind the curtain) and, being a product of their times, the blanket mood is unavoidably dark. There is one party scene the whole night, courtesy of female popping crew <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-48738471">AIM Collective</a>. Their piece Suspended starts with bodies in stasis, moving but getting nowhere, but it ends with a big-smiling upbeat number, as if maybe this dancing, this crew, these women are exactly the thing that’s keeping them going.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/14/breakin-convention-social-disdancing-review-sadlers-wells">Continue reading...</a>
