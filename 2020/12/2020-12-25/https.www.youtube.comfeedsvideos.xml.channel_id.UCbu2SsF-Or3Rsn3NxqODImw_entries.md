GameSpot has been around for a very long time, here is a video with every game we have every awarded with GameSpot's Game of the Year.

Since the late '90s, GameSpot has awarded Game of the Year to the one game each year that stood above the rest. After crowning our Game of the Year 2020, we decided to look back on our history and reflect on every game we decided was the best of the best.

From classics like Diablo and The Sims and blockbuster action titles like Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War, to peaceful meditations like Journey and competitive shooters like Overwatch--our GOTY award is an annual celebration of the diverse experiences video games can offer us.

Here's every game we've awarded Game of the Year in GameSpot's entire history.
