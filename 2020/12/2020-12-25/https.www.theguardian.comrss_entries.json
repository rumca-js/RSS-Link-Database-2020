The movement of hope and new life that Jesus came to inaugurate was attacked by a paranoid and narcissistic ruler who was willing to kill innocent children in a desperate attempt to cling to power.

In February and March, European governments chased down limited PPE stocks, ventilators, oxygen, out-of-stock reagents for their labs, and experimental steroids and drugs. The US was accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/trump-remdesivir-covid-19-drug\">stealing ventilators</a> from Barbados, PPE from Germany and it bought up the rights to remdesivir, limiting the supply available to other countries. At the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/trump-remdesivir-covid-19-drug\">World Health Assembly</a> in May, governments committed to sharing research products and working collectively to address Covid-19.
