<p>An Eric Bana-starring adaptation drops noir twists into a fly-blown regional Australia, as it buckles under the impacts of climate change</p><p>Released in 2016, Jane Harper’s debut novel, The Dry, evoked a sense of sundried desperation and El Niño-inspired unease that felt as familiar to many Australian readers as the book’s genre trappings (its tagline, “a desperate act in a small town with secrets”, could apply to anything from Twin Peaks to Top of the Lake).</p><p>The book hadn’t even hit shelves when producer Bruna Papandrea and screenwriter-director Robert Connolly started planning the film. Papandrea is perhaps best known today for adapting Liane Moriarty’s Big Little Lies for HBO, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/mar/23/has-the-satire-and-humour-of-big-little-lies-been-lost-in-translation">swapped Sydney’s northern beaches for affluent, coastal California</a> – but there was no separating The Dry<em> </em>from its western Victorian backdrop.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/24/the-dry-the-devastating-imagery-bringing-jane-harpers-bestseller-to-the-big-screen">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Brexit in a time of Covid: Crisis? What Crisis? Editorial

<p>Parliament should be recalled to deal with the crisis of coronavirus, not just that of leaving the EU</p><p>In January 1979, a beleaguered Labour prime minister, James Callaghan, returned from a Caribbean summit to a country that appeared in crisis. A week earlier, truck drivers had gone on strike, cutting off petrol supplies in the “winter of discontent”. When the prime minister arrived at London’s Heathrow airport, he held a press conference in which nothing memorable was said. Instead, in a phrase that has become code for political complacency, Callaghan became for ever associated with the following day’s Sun newspaper headline: “<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/921524.stm" title="">Crisis? What crisis?</a>”</p><p>His fate was sealed. Callaghan lost the next general election to Margaret Thatcher. The lesson for politicians is the importance of perception in a crisis. If something feels like a crisis, it is effectively a crisis. Britain now confronts its most serious emergency since the second world war. It faces the unprecedented challenge of coronavirus while adjusting to a new diminished status outside the European Union. The country’s health service is at breaking point, and its future as a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/15/946242592/support-for-scottish-independence-is-growing-partly-due-to-u-k-s-covid-19-respon?t=1608858768832" title="">unified state is on the line</a>.

Former president of the World Bank determined to alleviate poverty in less developed countries<p>“If you have wealth, you have to share it,” was the watchword of the former president of the World Bank James Wolfensohn, a larger than life, egotistical, supremely confident, inveterate networker, but fundamentally a good and witty man. Wolfensohn, who has died aged 86, made a great deal of money and gave a great deal away.</p><p>The zenith of his career was his two-term presidency of the World Bank, between 1995 and 2005, where his zest and passion for poverty alleviation left an indelible mark. Unafraid to confront the reality that too much of the World Bank’s lending found itself in anonymous offshore bank accounts held by recipients, he set up an anti-corruption task force, unthinkable before he arrived for fear of legitimising the bank’s critics while potentially smearing some innocent borrowers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/25/james-wolfensohn-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

Although he has known challenging times, there was no point in hiding parts of himself if he was going to nail his interview for the job as assistant coach of England’s Under-18s. “We’ve all been through different chapters,” Euell says. “Not everybody’s going to have a fairytale journey.”</p><p>Euell is thinking about the final stage of the interview with the Football Association: the lifelines section. He spoke about his mother, who was a single parent, and how his uncle was his male role model. The 43-year-old talked about going bankrupt after a property venture went south in 2010 and explained how highs often accompanied lows, recalling how tragedy struck after he scored twice for Charlton against West Ham in 2001. “The next afternoon my girlfriend, now my wife, is going through labour and has a stillbirth,” Euell says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/25/jason-euell-charlton-england-coach-manager-wimbledon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I had my reservations about this celebration of African heritage. Then my father and I shared a very special moment</p><p>In 1966, the African American Maulana Karenga created the holiday of Kwanzaa to give black people an “opportunity to celebrate themselves and their history” rather than indulge in the customary traditions of a white Christmas. The celebration starts on Boxing Day and runs for seven days, each marking one of the “principles of African heritage”, which include <em>umoja</em> (Swahili for unity), <em>kujichagulia</em> (self-determination) and <em>ujaama</em> (cooperative work and economics).</p><p>I have a complicated relationship with the holiday. I have always been suspicious of Karenga, the self-styled “master teacher” who seems more cult leader than black revolutionary, peddling a highly patriarchal message of African spirituality as some kind of salvation. It is undeniable that this festival, which takes its name from the Swahili for “first fruits”, but is set in the dead of winter, draws heavily on Christmas, yet Kwanzaa is extremely popular in black communities. I once recited a poem during a Kwanzaa celebration at Harvard, defending it as more than a “bootleg black Christmas”. And if a questionable origin story was a reason not to celebrate a cultural event, then we would all be at work on 25 December.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/25/happy-kwanzaa-its-so-much-more-than-a-black-christmas">Continue reading...</a>

One of the great English batsmen and captain of Surrey hailed for his gritty concentration<p>The cricketer John Edrich, who has died aged 83 after suffering from leukaemia, was one of the best English top order batsmen of the 20th century. Short, stocky, bushy-eyebrowed and brave, he played 77 times for his country between 1963 and 1976, and had an especially good record against the two best sides of his era – Australia and West Indies. In 1970-71, his superb batting performances were one of the key reasons that England managed to win the Ashes in Australia for the first time since 1956, and with Geoffrey Boycott in the late 1960s and early 70s he created a formidable opening partnership that provided many good platforms in Test matches. His best score, 310 not out against New Zealand, is the fifth highest for England in Tests.</p><p>In county cricket, Edrich was a leading figure for Surrey, whom he captained in his later days and with whom, from 1958 to 1978, he accumulated most of his 39,790 career runs, one of the highest tallies in history and at an impressive average of 45.47. By the end of his career, he had also become one of the rare breed of cricketers to have scored 100 hundreds (103 in all), putting him in the company of greats such as WG Grace, Jack Hobbs and Wally Hammond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/25/john-edrich-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Crisp, refreshing Kiwi sauvignon blanc or a vibrant Sicilian red should do the trick</p><p>You know that feeling just after Christmas when you’ve had enough? Enough turkey. More than enough mince pies. Enough stuffing, metaphorically and literally.

## My first 48 hours owning a kitten were emotional. Here's what I learned | Coco Khan

<p>I needed help reassuring a nervous cat but in the end it was me whose nerves were calmed. That is the magic of pets</p><p>I am writing this after my first 48 hours of kitten-rearing. As yet, she does not have a name. I wanted something that fits her personality but couldn’t find anything that translates as “carpet destroyer”; and my plan to honour her Persian heritage and magisterial ruff with something regal seemed silly given she is 15cm tall. (Although it would be funny to name her Genghis just to hear the vet call: “Genghis Khan?”)</p><p>It has been emotional. When she arrived she fled under the sofa. There she remained, trembling in the shadows, invisible except for the glassy flash of two blue eyes, refusing to be coaxed. I paced, I fretted, I Googled: “Have I traumatised my cat by adopting it?” I did not sleep.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/25/my-first-48-hours-owning-a-kitten-were-emotional-heres-what-i-learned">Continue reading...</a>

## This isn't a very joyful Christmas. But in mourning there is strength | Rev William Barber

<p>Let’s work together for a better world in 2021 – and a Christmas when we can truly sing of peace on Earth and good will to all people </p><p>As many Americans pause to celebrate the Christmas holiday this weekend, it is tempting to wish for a momentary pause in our public life of ceaseless conflict. Between a president who has refused to accept the reality of his defeat and an entire subculture that has made denying science a culture war in the midst of a global pandemic, an incredible amount of energy has been invested in division this year. While it may feel good to romanticize the spirit of the season and wish everyone a “Merry Christmas”, it would be more faithful to both the original Christmas story and our present circumstances to wish one another a “Mourning Christmas”.</p><p>Two thousand years ago, when Jesus was born in Bethlehem, inequality was rampant. Client state rulers like King Herod in Judea used their power to accumulate wealth from poor subjects. Jesus, the son of God, was born to a poor family who could not find a room to rent in Bethlehem. His birth was not celebrated by the wealthy or the politically powerful, but by migrant farm workers and foreign religious minorities. The movement of hope and new life that Jesus came to inaugurate was attacked by a paranoid and narcissistic ruler who was willing to kill innocent children in a desperate attempt to cling to power. The first Christmas was not merry and bright, but a mournful sight.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/25/christmas-america-jesus-covid-william-barber">Continue reading...</a>

Model who rose to fame in the 1990s, capturing the attention of Karl Lagerfeld and gracing the pages of Vogue<p>No one in fashion could guess what would succeed the smiling, buoyant healthfulness of the international supermodels who commanded catwalks and covers in the late 1980s and early 90s. The unexpected next big things turned out to be very particularly British: bad-waif Kate Moss, and cool aristo Stella Tennant, who arrived on the pages of British Vogue in 1993. She has died suddenly, shortly after her 50th birthday.</p><p>Tennant’s appeal had been prefigured in the release that year of Sally Potter’s film of the Virginia Woolf fantasy novel Orlando, its hero/heroine (nothing so simple as androgynous) played by Tilda Swinton; pipe-cleaner thin, tall, pale, unpainted, with a body language both male and female, and an ever-unready smile.

<p>Of all the lessons we’ve learned from this pandemic, the most significant is how unequal its effects have been</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>If you wanted to run an experiment on Earth to understand human behaviour, the pandemic would be the perfect opportunity. In some people, the virus that causes Covid-19 has no symptoms. In others it leads to deadly disease. The virus pits the healthy against those with underlying health issues, and the young against the old. Infectious diseases <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/29/coronavirus-britain-infectious-diseases-flu-community">can bind us together</a> or drive us apart. Low-income countries know this too well; many face multiple outbreaks of infectious diseases each year. But richer countries such as Britain are still painfully learning that a virus doesn’t just attack the human body: it holds up a mirror to national weaknesses and runs havoc across society and the economy.</p><p>Across the world, the pandemic has resulted in a perverse “Hunger Games”, where countries have competed in mortality rate league tables while also trying to save their economies and cope with successive waves of this disease. In February and March, European governments chased down limited PPE stocks, ventilators, oxygen, out-of-stock reagents for their labs, and experimental steroids and drugs. The US was accused of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/trump-remdesivir-covid-19-drug">stealing ventilators</a> from Barbados, PPE from Germany and it bought up the rights to remdesivir, limiting the supply available to other countries. At the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/trump-remdesivir-covid-19-drug">World Health Assembly</a> in May, governments committed to sharing research products and working collectively to address Covid-19. But when governments were faced with tough decisions about how to share resources, their promises of cooperation broke down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/25/covid-19-good-health-biology-pandemic-unequal-effects">Continue reading...</a>

<p>During the pandemic, there have been many unsung heroes – from supermarket staff to the people who carried on doing essential work for our society. Here are some of them</p><p>At the start of lockdown, I interviewed the virologist Dr Jane Greatorex. She was superb, with a gunslinging turn-of-phrase (“corona is the only pathogen in town”) and full of advice that rammed home, like no shambling government press conference ever could, the gravity of our situation. She washed deliveries before they came into the house, would talk to her neighbour only through a hedge and described the precautionary measures taken by her sister, who worked in Waitrose. Those were pretty intense – involving a lot of changes of clothes and black bin bags, plus a lifesize cutout of Jürgen Klopp.</p><p>I have thought about her sister a lot: what it is like when everyone else is avoiding their closest friends for safety, and you are seeing 50 strangers an hour. I have also thought about delivery drivers, knocking on doors with no idea who might be self-isolating behind them; bus drivers, getting sneezed on by squads of schoolchildren; teachers, carers, anyone anywhere near a hospital. Especially at the height of the crisis (when there were serious questions over whether it was safe to handle a petrol pump) while battalions of people were living in this cacophony of anxiety and caution, and having to block it out, every day, in order to go and do their jobs. The bravery of that is hard to wrestle into comprehension – though as thought experiments go, it is a lot less uncomfortable than trying to imagine what would have happened if everyone in these vital services had simply refused to perform them: if all these workers who, being often low-paid, and were previously held as low value, had called the world’s bluff.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/25/many-people-did-something-immense-for-complete-strangers-readers-heroes-of-2020">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There is even less to do than usual over the festive break so why not watch live sport and when that has finished a few decent sport documentaries? <br /></p><p>In a year when solace has been in greater demand than multipacks of loo roll, thank goodness for televised sport. Once it began to creep its way back in the summer, and despite the struggles and setbacks since, being able to watch people run about competitively has provided a form of escape. Now, with the festive season upon us, an even greater weight has been placed on the shoulders of sport. Not only must it help us block out the rubbish going on in the world, it also has to do so for many more hours in the day. Fortunately there is no shortage of sporting action, both live and edited, for you to enjoy. Here are some of the best choices available via various apps and providers over the coming days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/25/christmas-may-be-cancelled-but-sport-on-tv-can-save-the-day-once-again">Continue reading...</a>

Arsenal are the world’s 11th-richest football club, the players elite athletes processed through a brutally hard-nosed system.

<p>I jumped in the cab to find a tall handsome stranger sitting in the back</p><p>It was a beautiful spring day in Manhattan in May 2016. The air was crisp and the skies were blue, so I decided to walk across town to meet a friend for lunch. I had gone only a few blocks when what felt like a tornado hit: my light coat was no match for the heavy rain; my hair blew in 10 directions, and garbage hit me in the face. I tried to hail a cab, but there weren’t any. Uber prices were surging, so I decided to take a punt on an UberPool (you could end up travelling with a stranger, but there’s a discount). I hoped nobody would get in to join me on the short trip.</p><p>The cab pulled around the corner immediately. I jumped in to find a tall, handsome stranger sitting in the back. My heart started to race. I casually glanced in his direction before smoothly sitting down beside him (or so I thought; if you ask him about it now, he says I straight up stared at him).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/25/experience-i-fell-in-love-in-an-uber">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The German arrived with a big reputation but his style is complex and Frank Lampard is still trying to work it out<br /></p><p>Naturally the Germans have a word for it. They call it <em>chancentod</em>: literally, “chance death”. Being described as a <em>chancentod</em> doesn’t necessarily make you a bad player. It’s not a tag you’re stuck with for life. All it means is that at the moment, you possess an unerring and uncanny ability to squander whatever goalscoring opportunity is presented to you. Which, for all his manifold qualities, feels like a pretty good way of describing Timo Werner at Chelsea right now.</p><p>To watch Werner of late is to be torn between pity and disbelief.

<p>Two books, one by Sarah Smarsh and a ‘life in lyrics’ by Parton, offer a reminder that the singer is a social unifier, a musical trailblazer and a business genius</p><p>In 1977, Dolly Parton was interviewed by Barbara Walters in a TV special. The singer was 31 and, having not long extricated herself from a professional partnership with the country singer Porter Wagoner, had conquered the pop charts with the album <em>Here You Come Again</em>. Walters asked if puberty came early for Parton and, gesturing to her breasts, inquired: “Is it all you?” She then invited Parton to stand up so viewers could inspect her figure, and asked why she bothered with the makeup, the wigs and the clothes. “You don’t have to look like this,” Walters said, wagging a finger at her.</p><p>Walters isn’t the only one to have treated Parton like a prize cow. Oprah Winfrey once ushered her on to her feet and invited everyone to take a closer look, as did the talk show host Phil Donahue, who added: “I know guys that wouldn’t let you out of the house.” Johnny Carson looked at her chest on national TV and said: “I would give about a year’s pay to peek under there.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/25/she-come-by-it-natural-dolly-parton-songteller-review-no-dumb-blonde">Continue reading...</a>
