Lyrics for All the Way:

I didn’t plan to fall in love with you
I had a million other projects to do
Mama said honey you should focus on school
Papa was watching you like crazy glue
 
Soon as you walked in
My brain checked out
You know I’m yours
 
I won’t be changing my mind
Boy this is your day
Let’s go to second base yeah
I won’t be flaking this time
Don’t care what they say
I might go all the way yeah
Ooo ooo
All the way yeah
I won’t be changing my mind
 
I stayed up late hoping that my phone would buzz
I woke up early just to text you my love
Jessie she says that you’re just in it for fun
Johnny agrees but I still think you’re the one
 
Soon as you walked in
My brain checked out
You know I’m yours
 
I won’t be changing my mind
Boy this is your day
Let’s go to second base yeah
I won’t be flaking this time
Don’t care what they say
I might go all the way yeah
Ooo ooo
All the way yeah
I won’t be changing my mind
