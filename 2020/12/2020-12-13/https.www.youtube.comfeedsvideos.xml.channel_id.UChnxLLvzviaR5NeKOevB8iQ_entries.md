This patch was made to try and figure out the Intellijel Rainmaker. It provides a delay line that reverses and ping-pongs.

Hermod has 3 sequences on it, each one with a different level of complexity I switch between them to create "song" sections, as well as mute and unmute tracks to create structure. I also use the mutes on the Varigate+ to mute and unmute drum tracks. Vocals were recorded in real-time into a TC Helicon Perform VE. Additional effects were from the ZOIA running a high-passed reverb and delay on all the sounds that weren't going into a eurorack effect.

Rings is split between the Rainmaker and Z500. Even voices go to Rainmaker, odd voices go to the reverb on the Z500. Dixie is filtered through the Stereo Dipole and then split between Rainmaker and Monsoon. Pico Voice is my main solo voice and I play it while manipulating the Harvestman filter it's going through. Tetrapad is set to increase reverb times on Z5000 and Monsoon, the filter cutoff on the Stereo Dipole, the time on the Z500, the wetness of the reverb on Monsoon, and the cutoff of the Pico Voice filter through the Harvestman.
