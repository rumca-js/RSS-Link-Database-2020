Is this high-specced Linux laptop enough to make me switch from my Mac?

This is a review of the new Kubuntu Focus M2 laptop with a fast Intel i7 processor, 32 GB of RAM, a speedy Nvidia GPU, and oh, did I mention it comes preinstalled with Kubuntu Linux for a great out-of-the-box experience?

I'll run through some of my workflows, and how the 2020 Kubuntu Focus M2 stacks up against my current 2019 MacBook Pro with similar specs.
