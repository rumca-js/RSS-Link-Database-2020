## Arsenal beaten again as Burnley profit from own goal and Xhaka red card

<p>Earlier in the week, Mikel Arteta was asked whether his senior players were letting him down. He flat-batted the question but, just in case anybody was still wondering, it has surely now been answered beyond all doubt. Arsenal have racked up a varied collection of new lows in recent years but this woeful defeat to Burnley, along with the inexcusable idiocy that precipitated it, surely caps the lot.</p><p>Granit Xhaka’s rehabilitation since falling out with the home fans last season was one of the early success stories of the Arteta era. After 58 minutes of a tense, scruffy match that reflected the fact team and manager are under mounting pressure, Xhaka threw Arteta’s trust back in his face. He had just fouled a breaking Dwight McNeil and it was hard to tell what enraged him during the ensuing melee, in which he squared up to Ashley Westwood. A VAR check showed conclusively, though, that he had grabbed Westwood around the throat and a red card was in little doubt once Graham Scott had checked his pitchside monitor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/13/arsenal-burnley-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Labour should show it could work with like-minded parties by committing to proportional representation</p><p>More than a year ago, Labour won its lowest number of parliamentary seats in a general election since 1935. Sir Keir Starmer began by saying Labour was “<a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/keir-starmer-new-management-jeremy-corbyn_uk_5f1818fbc5b6128e681ed79f" title="">under new management</a>”. He now offers <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-54203162" title="">new leadership</a>. That is unlikely to be enough. Whereas managers want to do things right, leaders do the right thing. Leaders scan the horizon for destinations; managers are guided by short-term considerations. Sir Keir’s task is to lead his party to victory while building a coalition to unseat the Conservatives. Organisations fail when they are over-managed and under-led.</p><p>Sir Keir says Labour has a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/04/we-have-a-mountain-to-climb-keir-starmer-on-winning-the-next-election" title="">mountain to climb</a>”, higher than that scaled by the party in 1997.

The political situation may be even worse in four years’ time. The law requires <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/sn05929/" title="">independent reviews of constituency boundaries</a> every five years. The next review could recommend changes that, if enacted, could see Labour left with a steeper ascent and a higher peak to conquer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/13/the-guardian-view-on-a-progressive-alliance-divided-they-fall">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether it be via football or fashion, the rest of the world is tied to what is happening in Xinjiang – as Antoine Griezmann has reminded us<br /></p><p>What once seemed surely unthinkable has become, in just a few years, irrefutable. The evidence amassed by scholars, journalists and campaigners of grotesque human rights abuses in Xinjiang has begun to cut through to the wider public. On Thursday, the France and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/barcelona" title="">Barcelona</a> forward Antoine Griezmann <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/10/griezmann-cuts-ties-with-huawei-citing-fears-over-treatment-of-uighurs" title="">cut his commercial ties</a> to the Chinese tech giant Huawei, saying there were “strong suspicions” that it has contributed to the repression of Uighurs. His statement followed <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/08/huawei-tested-ai-software-that-could-recognize-uighur-minorities-alert-police-report-says/" title="">a report</a> that Huawei tested a facial recognition system developed by artificial intelligence firm Megvii that could be used to identify Uighurs and trigger an alert to their presence. (Huawei has said that its technologies are not designed to identify ethnic groups.)</p><p>In parallel, a <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/12/09/china-big-data-program-targets-xinjiangs-muslims" title="">rare leak</a> of a prisoner list from a camp has shown how a government data programme has targeted Uighurs for detention <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/09/being-young-leads-to-detention-in-chinas-xingiang-region" title="">simply for being young</a>, using VPNs, or speaking to relatives abroad. These stories offer a truly chilling vision of a hi-tech surveillance society and give the lie to China’s claims that its actions in Xinjiang are focused on targeting terrorism and separatism, and do not treat a population as inherently suspect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/13/the-guardian-view-on-chinas-treatment-of-the-uighurs-from-unthinkable-to-irrefutable">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unlike almost every trade agreement in history, a UK-EU one will result in more friction and less cooperation than before</p><p>As the seemingly interminable Brexit negotiations draw to their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/dec/13/brexit-uk-eu-trade-talks-enter-final-day-amid-fears-of-no-deal-live-news">final conclusion</a>, both Boris Johnson and the EU negotiators are reverting to type. For the EU, this means making – and then withdrawing – an 11th-hour proposal for a “ratchet clause” that would ensure “dynamic alignment” with “level-playing field conditions”. For Johnson, it meant a festival of xenophobia: first insulting the French, then <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/12/tories-criticise-boris-johnson-navy-gunboats-brexit-threat">threatening to use gunboats</a> to fight EU fishermen, and finally causing deep offence to Angela Merkel and the German people. It is shaming.</p><p>Yet the talks continue. Though their methods may differ, both Britain and the EU have a common interest in raising the temperature in the last stage of thrashing out a deal. Just as Johnson plays the politics of the gutter press, the EU is also a political entity. For their own audiences, each has to give the impression of fighting for their interests to the bitter end. The two sides released an almost laughably downbeat joint statement at lunchtime saying the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/13/hopes-for-avoiding-no-deal-brexit-hang-on-boris-johnson-call-to-von-der-leyen">talks would go on</a>.

<p>Fabulously talented and famously outspoken, Stefflon Don is one of rap’s hottest stars. Here, she opens up about controversy, teen motherhood and staying true to herself</p><p>I was trying not to be in the lockdown,” rapper Stefflon Don tells me, running a multicoloured claw through back-length, honey-blonde extensions. “Hell no!” When we speak via Zoom in mid-November, Don is in Ghana, where she has flown to escape London, with her mother, son and a close friend in tow. Despite it being a trip for pleasure, she has a studio session booked that evening. “No matter where I go, I’m always gonna work,” she tells me.</p><p>This nonstop grind has paid dividends. Stephanie Victoria Allen, 28, known to friends and fans as Steff, is one of Britain’s biggest exports, according to the all- important stats: 5.78bn streams globally, 2.3bn streams on Apple Music alone, 444m views on Vevo, 1.2m subscribers on YouTube. But mainstream recognition eludes her in the UK, particularly when compared to some of her less commercially successful male counterparts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/13/rapper-stefflon-don-interview-i-am-never-scared-to-try-things">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Black Country Living Museum could be most popular in the world on the social media site<br /></p><p>The <a href="https://www.bclm.co.uk/">Black Country Living Museum</a> is an open-air attraction that tells the story of Britain’s early manufacturing history, set in the defiantly unstarry town of Dudley, in England’s industrial Midlands. Among the exhibits that have earned it a clutch of awards are two mine shafts, a lime kiln and a collection of postwar <a href="https://www.bclm.co.uk/collections/trolley-bus-collection/28.htm">trolley buses</a>.</p><p>This month the visitor attraction gained another, more unexpected accolade, becoming – it believes – the most popular museum in the world on TikTok. It has more than 350,000 followers worldwide, and its short video clips, often featuring a cast of re-enactors in historic dress, can attract many more viewers. A <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@blackcountrymuseum/video/6892321157941415170">recent video</a> featuring a character called “1920s grandad” offering advice in a tar-thick Black Country accent has been viewed more than 2.2m times. “My favourite TikTok account giving me LIFE right now,” reads one of the clip’s almost 12,000 comments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/dec/13/how-a-dudley-museum-became-a-tiktok-sensation">Continue reading...</a>

## This Brexit disaster has been brewing in the Conservative party for 30 years | John Harris

<p>Margaret Thatcher helped turn the Tory right into a force for instability – and now we are all living with the consequences</p><p>What a strange, head-spinning moment this is. The news is awash with reports of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/12/ikea-latest-firm-to-suffer-shortages-and-delays-due-to-clogged-uk-ports">queues at the ports</a>, the <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ministers-warn-supermarkets-to-stockpile-food-amid-no-deal-brexit-fears-zc36tsf6z">stockpiling of food and medicines</a> and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/13/bailouts-blame-and-broken-glass-uk-papers-paint-grim-picture-of-possible-no-deal-brexit">government committee</a> charged with “exit operations”, but the plain political fact that sits under everything is in a surreal league of its own. Amid an unprecedented pandemic that blurs into an equally unprecedented economic and social crisis, Britain has a government more than prepared to take the deranged option of inflicting even more disaster on its own country. Everything remains uncertain; both sides say the chances of a trade deal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/13/hopes-for-avoiding-no-deal-brexit-hang-on-boris-johnson-call-to-von-der-leyen">remain slim</a>.</p><p>As a reminder of the stupidity and arrogance that got us into this mess, the Conservatives and their cheerleaders in the press are inevitably <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/13/bailouts-blame-and-broken-glass-uk-papers-paint-grim-picture-of-possible-no-deal-brexit">blaming</a> the supposedly vengeful Europeans. Of late, some people have even been heard alleging that some of the <a href="https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2020/12/are-remainers-blame-hard-brexit">responsibility lies with remainers</a> who refused to back a softer Brexit in parliament. The truth, of course, is that leaving the EU in this chaotic way is the work of the pro-Brexit right: not the result of other people’s failings, but its own conscious designs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/13/brexit-disaster-conservative-party-margaret-thatcher-tory-right">Continue reading...</a>

<p>All my family’s good intentions crumble when we remember just how cold it is outside in New York at this time of year</p><p>“I want to go straight home.” This is the first thing my children say to me when I collect them from school or the learning centre where they go on the days school is closed. Nothing will move them; not the promise of a cake pop from Starbucks, nor the lure of the playground, nor the odd jumbo falsehood I throw in their path. “I bet the ice-cream truck is there!” I say, walking down the hill while trying to steer them off route in the direction of the park. It is -1C (30F) outside and the sky is lightning white. Twenty minutes later we are all on the sofa and don’t move for two hours, until dinner.</p><p>This is not how it was supposed to be. All summer and autumn we talked about how, with the pandemic cutting off indoor venues for socialising, we were going to do winter outdoors. We discussed how people did it in Norway, how prolonged exposure to cold weather was not only a necessity but a spiritual advance. This would be good for us! Bundling up, learning some endurance, on top of all the other endurance we’d learned, taking great gulps of frosty air. I imagined myself in winter guise, going on brisk, self-improving walks while enjoying the latest in quilted-jacket technology.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/13/year-outdoors-family-cold-new-york">Continue reading...</a>

There, they cut through a skylight and lowered themselves on to shelving inside the building. The warehouse burglar alarms stayed silent; the men had carefully avoided tripping motion sensors positioned by the doors.</p><p>Once inside, with several lookouts posted around the surrounding industrial estate, the men took their time. Over the next five hours and 15 minutes, they broke padlocks off packing cases and placed items inside 16 large holdalls taken from inside the warehouse.

## George Clooney: ‘It’s been a crappy year, but we will come out of it better’

<p>Marriage and fatherhood have given George Clooney a new perspective on life, work and the world we all share. While his young twins play outside, he talks about outsmarting war criminals, battles with Boris and dinnertime debates with Amal</p><p>Dad-chat with George Clooney, father of two. While the actor’s twin three-year-olds, Ella and Alexander, are out on the family tennis court, learning to ride their bikes, Clooney sits in a curtained edit suite inside his Los Angeles home, wondering how they’re getting on out there. “They’ve learned how to get going <em>fast</em>,” says the 59-year-old who, unless otherwise specified, speaks at all times in the measured, half-ironic, woodsmoked tones of just about every leading man he’s played in a quarter-century career. “They just haven’t learned to use their brakes yet.”</p><p>Clooney rubs at his two-day beard, anxious, fond. He wears a fawn-coloured polo shirt and he has his grey hair cropped short. I think I notice that slightly wild-eyed look of someone still marvelling at the fact of their parenthood, and I ask him, is he a scaredy-cat dad, always trailing behind his children with his arms outstretched in case they fall? Or is he a let-them-fall-to-learn-about-the-hard-truths-of-the-world sort of dad?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/13/george-clooney-interview-its-been-a-crappy-year-but-we-will-come-out-of-it-better">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joshua K Jackson’s portraits of late-night London life feature vivid rain-soaked streets full of strange intimacy</p><p>Windows are almost ever-present in <a href="https://www.setantabooks.com/book_author/joshua-k-jackson/">Joshua K Jackson</a>’s pictures of late-night Soho. Misted up, or rained on or red-lit, glass often separates the restive men and women in his photographs from satisfactions just out of reach. London’s shameless, shameful heart is seen through the searching gaze of those after just one more drink, one more good time. Promises are reflected in crimson and indigo neon, and everyone, photographer included, is cast as a voyeur.</p><p>Jackson started taking the pictures – gathered in a monograph, <em>Sleepless in Soho</em> – as an antidote to his own insomnia. Using a portrait lens and drawn to saturated colour, his images recall a world of intimacy strangely alien to lockdown eyes – first snogs and last kisses are snatched in doorways and tube stations, drinks are abandoned on bar-room tables, solitary silhouettes draw on desperate smokes, melancholy clubbers’ bodies are packed on to night buses home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/13/the-big-picture-sohos-neon-nights">Continue reading...</a>
