Travel from high to low risk areas

Up to three households can stay together, "Christmas bubble" from 23 to 27 December

All four UK nations

Genetic mechanisms of critical illness in Covid-19 Nature, Edinburgh)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03065-y

Susceptibility to viral infection

Propensity to develop harmful pulmonary inflammation.

Genetic factors in:

Susceptibility to life threatening infections

Immune-mediated diseases

Host genetic variants

Genome-wide association study

N = 2, 244 critically ill Covid-19 patients

From 208 UK intensive care units

Genome-wide significant associations

Potential for repurposing of licensed medications

Associations with severe COVID

Low expression of IFNAR2 (Chromosome 21)

Results in lower production of interferon

Accounted for nearly 15% of critical Covid-19 cases

Interferons interfere with viral replication

Produce antiviral enzymes to prevent viral replication

Inhibit protein synthesis

Stimulate local immune cells

Cause fever, muscle aches and general malaise

Interferon would need to be given early

WHO SOLIDARITY trial

https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/global-research-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/solidarity-clinical-trial-for-covid-19-treatments

Interferon had little or no effect on overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay in hospitalized patients

Nebulised interferon beta-1a for patients with COVID-19 (12th November)

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30523-3/fulltext

High expression of TYK2 (Chromosome 19)

Up regulation of inflammation

Rheumatoid arthritis drug, Baricitinib targets this biological mechanism

Large-scale randomised clinical trials will be essential
