It\u2019s apt because he is many things: scholar, composer, writer, producer, entrepreneur, activist. He\u2019s also one of the most fascinating opera singers of his generation. His taste runs towards uncharted territory; he creates new roles with an expressive intensity of voice and body to reveal the complex humanity of each character he inhabits.\n \nI met Dav\u00f3ne last February, just before the world shut down. I\u2019d been on the road for weeks with a lingering cold, pulling into Boston on the last slow train out of Penn Station, late on a bitter winter night. In the morning, I dragged myself to rehearsal, bedraggled as a stray cat. It was a hectic schedule -- new music to rehearse, staging and light cues, a complicated show -- so it wasn\u2019t until our lunch break that Dav\u00f3ne and I really had a chance to say hello.\n \nIt took about five minutes for us to become friends -- for many reasons. We\u2019re both adventurous artists who make strange, beautiful things. We\u2019re highly disciplined breakers of rules. We both have 100 ideas every 10 minutes, and we act on 97 of them. We\u2019re opinionated and outspoken. We both care quite a lot about clothes. \n \nBut what cemented our friendship was a song. I had with me the sheet music of a newly-discovered song called \u201cWhen The Dove Enters In,\u201d composed by Margaret Bonds to a text by Langston Hughes. Close friends and collaborators, their creative connection was powerful; Bond\u2019s music revealed new harmonies and rhythms in Hughes\u2019 poems. This song is about the strength of human connection -- about redemption and salvation. I showed it to Dav\u00f3ne and we read through it together, finding immediate and true friendship in its notes and words. \n \nWe\u2019ve been working on this song for a while now, through all the changes this year has brought, and we were inspired to make a music video in collaboration with the visual artist Leila Victorin.\n \nThis is a conversation about revealing and embracing the fullness of our humanity, in our music, in our intentions and actions. You find us at the end of a long, hard year, looking back with all the longing that comes with isolation, grateful for a song we read together before the world shut down, and mindful of its meaning.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYnDSuG3Y48", "date_published": "2020-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Ashley Ray: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nRobin Hilton | December 11, 2020\nI've always found something comforting in the music of Ashley Ray. When I saw her in this Tiny Desk (home) concert, sitting on a screened-in porch with producer, songwriter and longtime friend Sean MConnell (and a distant chorus of crickets chirping in the early evening light), I realized why: Her songs sound like home. Love of family, the memories and traditions we share, tales of loving the past until it's time to let it go: They're all in her music, amplified by this setting, with beautiful, two-part harmonies and a couple of acoustic guitars.The three songs performed here \u2013 \"Pauline,\" \"Dirty Work\" and \"Just A House\" \u2013 are all from Ashley Ray's latest album, Pauline (No. 26 on our list of the 50 Best Albums Of 2020). It feels like a breakout release for this Kansas native, but she's been putting in the hard work for close to 20 years now, spending much of her time waiting tables while writing songs for better-known artists like Little Big Town, Lori McKenna and Ruston Kelly.  But her best and most affecting work to date arrived with Pauline, after she decided to open up and share her own deeply personal stories of love and loss. After living and trying to make it in Nashville the past couple of decades, it's a kind of homecoming for Ashley Ray, and she takes us with her.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\n    \"Pauline\"\n    \"Dirty Work\"\n    \"Just A House\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n\n    Ashley Ray: vocals, guitar\n    Sean McConnell: guitar, vocals\n\nCREDITS\n\n    Video: Ryan Nolan\n    Audio: Sean McConnell\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n\n    Producer: Robin Hilton\n    Video Producer: Maia Stern\n    Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n    Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n    Tiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Morgan Noelle Smith\n    Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n    Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujDMZENuwwE", "date_published": "2020-12-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
