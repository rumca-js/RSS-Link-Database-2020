At The Current, we were so fortunate that Lizzo lived in our local community for a few years as her career took flight. She visited our studio on a number of occasions and performed at our live events in different configurations: with the Chalice, with GRRRL PRTY, and of course, as a solo artist. We'll feature a number of live-concert performances by Lizzo during our On-Air Fest, happening Saturday and Sunday, Dec. 12 and 13. Meanwhile, here are three unforgettable in-studio performances recorded by Lizzo at The Current.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Paris\" (2014)\n3:11 \"Cuz I Love You\" (2019)\n6:17 \"Juice\" (2019)\n\nPERSONNEL\nLizzo \u2013 vocals\nSophia Eris \u2013 backing vocals (2014)\nLazerbeak \u2013 beats (2014)\nWalter Williams \u2013 guitar (2019)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Helen Teague\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Michael DeMark\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/21/lizzo\n2014 The Current Birthday Party, live at First Avenue:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/02/06/current-9th-birthday-videos\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/12/10/lizzo-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2016 GRRRL PRTY live at Rock the Garden:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/06/30/grrrl-prty-perform-at-rock-the-garden-2016\n2019 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/05/07/lizzo-in-the-current-studio\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#lizzo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8w-7yc4hFA", "date_published": "2020-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Bon Iver - two songs at Rock the Garden 2017", "description": "Bon Iver is one of two acts (the other being Courtney Barnett) who hold the distinction of playing Rock the Garden more than once. Bon Iver's first appearance was in 2008, when Rock the Garden was rebooted following a four-year hiatus. In 2008, Bon Iver opened the show, which stands in stark contrast to 2017, when Bon Iver headlined the day. The Current's upcoming On-Air Fest, happening December 12 and 13, will feature live recordings of Bon Iver from Rock the Garden 2008 and 2017, along with an in-studio session cut.
