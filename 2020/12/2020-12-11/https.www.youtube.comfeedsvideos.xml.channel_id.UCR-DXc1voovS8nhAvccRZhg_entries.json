I know it's still hard to get your hands on the official Compute Module IO Board, but maybe you won't have to, if you're able to get your hands on one of these unique and awesome other boards!\n\nSome of them are released under the Open Source Hardware License, so you could even build them or make improvements to them on your own. Other ones are still in concept or prototype phase, but whatever the case, I'm excited about all of them and will be tracking these and more new boards in this GitHub issue:\n\nhttps://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/25\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\nAlso check out the videos I referenced in this video:\n\n  - Raspberry Pi Cluster with the Turing Pi: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgVz4-SEhbE\n  - Raspberry Pi 400 Teardown: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqpylxLhw98\n  - Raspberry Pi SATA NAS: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWev1THtA04\n\n#RaspberryPi #ComputeModule4\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Pi PCIe Card Database\n01:10 - GitHub issue tracking CM4 Projects\n01:17 - BG5USN's PiTray Mini\n01:58 - Turing Pi V2\n03:11 - CM4 Micro ATX Motherboard\n04:41 - Gumstix IO board with M.2 slot\n05:10 - Gumstix CM4 to CM3 slot adapter\n05:57 - PiKeeb\n06:43 - StereoPi V2\n07:13 - mebs_t Pi CM4 NAS board + case\n08:19 - Uptime Lab CM4 1U Blade Server\n08:51 - Piunora\n10:14 - Possibilities\n10:51 - CM4 Availability\n12:21 - Open Source Hardware\n13:05 - Working in the open\n14:07 - Baby Launch Upcoming!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vSGl5kpf-k", "date_published": "2020-12-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
