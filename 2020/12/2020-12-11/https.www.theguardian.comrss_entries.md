Hearn’s fighter, Anthony Joshua, faces Pulev on Saturday night in the first world heavyweight title contest to take place in a bio-secure Covid-19 bubble. The curiously open and engaging nature of boxing, the most brutal and dangerous of all sports, has been even more evident this week as the fighters, managers, promoters, television crews and lowly writers have all been cooped up together in a cordoned-off section of a hotel in Wembley.</p><p>“He’s scary,” Hearn continued after I told him how Pulev had been a quiet revelation whether talking about books or his father, psychology or his conviction that he will beat Joshua. “Every time I’ve seen him this week I’ve gone like that.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/11/anthony-joshua-heavyweight-boxing-world-champion-kubrat-pulev">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Garrick theatre, London</strong> <br />Panto innuendo, outrageous caricatures and death by crispy pancake haunt a riotous Christmas whodunnit</p><p>A cast of drag kings and queens have been summoned to a West End stage to perform a whodunnit. Will anyone get out alive? For the first 10 minutes, I wasn’t sure. The parody felt broad, the jokes broader still. “Lord von Fistenberg treated me to a big shiny pearl necklace!”: it’s like Mrs Brown’s Boys with more face paint. But there’s no resisting the exuberance of Death Drop. Soon, as its cast of pop starlets, tweedy squires and tabloid hacks assemble, and the phone lines are cut, and the roads blocked, this “Dragatha Christie” mystery exerts a grip – of the comedic, if not the suspense, variety.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/11/death-drop-review-dragatha-christie-drag-whodunnit">Continue reading...</a>

Played by Jeremy Bradfield with a cartoon Italian accent and the petulance of a small child, he could be lost in a backstage wardrobe.</p><p>That’s appropriate because everything about Mark Calvert’s Northern Stage production screams theatre.

<p>Once again, a report has laid bare shocking treatment of mothers and babies. Ministers and NHS bosses must now do what it says</p><p>“Kate was the most beautiful baby you’ve ever seen … when Kate was born, quite literally, a light lifted inside me, it was so physical the love I felt … and that love turned into sheer determination.” Six hours after she was born at Ludlow community hospital in 2009, Kate Stanton-Davies was dead.

This&nbsp;week’s publication of what are described as “emerging findings” is only a staging post, based on 250&nbsp;cases; the total number being examined has risen to 1,862 since the report was commissioned by the then health secretary, Jeremy Hunt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/11/the-guardian-view-on-a-maternity-care-scandal-reform-without-delay">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Coronation Street: more than just a soap | Editorial

<p>The television institution has held on to a unique identity across six decades</p><p>In the Coronation Street writers’ room at Granada Studios, a magnificent black and white photograph of Ena Sharples used to adorn the wall. Wearing her signature hairnet, the legendary denizen of the Rovers Return snug is looking out at grimy 1960s Manchester. <a href="https://twitter.com/frankcottrell_b/status/553995969961132032" title="">According to</a> the onetime scriptwriter, Frank Cotterell Boyce, someone wrote a caption for it: “When I was a lass there was Coronation St, Inkerman Street, the Red Rec. And the rest of the world was all talk.”</p><p>Coronation Street, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/09/every-character-was-eccentric-it-was-beautiful-the-inside-story-of-coronation-street" title="">turned 60</a> this week, has always been parochial in the best sense of the word. The fictional northern town of Weatherfield is a community unto itself, and storylines seldom stray beyond its borders into real-life Manchester. Instead, the myriad crises and dilemmas posed by changing times come to the street. Against the familiar backdrop of terraced houses, the corner shop and the Rovers, they have all been dealt with, one way or another. However complicated and unpredictable life is, in&nbsp;Weatherfield almost anything can be sorted out over a cup of tea, a pint or, in Ken Barlow’s case, a half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/11/the-guardian-view-on-coronation-street-more-than-just-a-soap">Continue reading...</a>

He made movies which were shocking, scabrous and violent - yet also often hauntingly sad and plangently beautiful and sometimes just plain weird. But they were strangely hypnotic. In 2011, I was on the Cannes Un Certain Regard jury which gave the top prize to his opaque docufictional piece Arirang, and though I struggle a bit now to recapture the mood of certainty that led us to that decision, there is no doubt about that Kim’s work had a commanding effect.</p><p>In fact, Kim himself might be a more prominent figure himself were it not that he was involved in the #MeToo controversy – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/07/three-woman-accuse-korean-director-kim-ki-duk-rape-assault">three actors accused him of sexual assault</a> which resulted in a fine for the director and inconclusive recrimination in the civil courts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/11/kim-ki-duk-shock-violence-beauty-south-korea-director">Continue reading...</a>

It was a timely reminder that the UK has always had to rely on others – in this case, the US – even for what successive British governments have described as the “ultimate assurance of our national security”, a reference to the so-called independent nuclear deterrent.</p><p>As the late Anthony King observed in his book Who Governs Britain?, if sovereignty means acting independently without outside interference, the UK “is no longer remotely a sovereign state”.

That made her a natural for Littlewood, who was wary of what she called, in heavily inverted commas, “acting”. Like a lot of the young women at Theatre Workshop, Windsor was previously a performer at Winston’s nightclub in London. “They could all sing, dance, ad lib, change clothes in a matter of seconds,” wrote Littlewood, “and light up the scene.” Barbara Windsor went on lighting up the scene for the rest of her life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/11/barbara-windsor-a-priceless-and-mischievous-stage-sensation">Continue reading...</a>

## Am I having a life crisis. Or is this just life? | Coco Khan

<p>In recent weeks I’ve found myself frustrated, directionless, intensely nostalgic – and staring into the fridge</p><p>I have a theory that, much as the pandemic accelerated inevitable societal changes – working from home, e-schooling, the end of cash – it also accelerated inevitable personal changes. Take friendships. A <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/25/do-people-start-losing-friends-at-a-certain-age" title="">2016 study found</a> that we accumulate friends until 25, then steadily lose them as we age. But chuck a pandemic in there and we’re all down to six. A US survey from last year earmarked 39 as the age people start thinking about changing careers. Yet in light of Covid, <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.lbc.co.uk/news/half-of-workers-plan-to-change-career-within-a-year-because-of-coronavirus/" title="">50% of Brits are thinking</a> that very thing.</p><p>Which might explain why, in lockdown two, I’ve found myself frustrated, directionless and nostalgic for the past (specifically brunch: I really miss brunch); and why each day I plod around thinking about everything and nothing, staring into the fridge. It can mean only one thing. I’m having a pandemic-induced early midlife crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/11/am-i-having-a-life-crisis-or-is-this-just-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The key trend at the close of 2020 is for proper ready-made cocktails conjured up by your favourite bars </p><p>Who would have thought that the main trend in spirits at the end of 2020 would be not gin (for once), or even up-and-coming rum, but ready-to-drink cocktails? I’m not talking about the rather wimpy cans of cosmopolitan et al that have been around for a while, but posh cocktails of the kind you get in the swankiest bars. In fact, that is exactly what they are, bars having followed in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/13/the-gift-of-your-favourite-restaurant-grace-dent-finish-at-home-meal-kits">restaurants</a> by making their wares available for takeaway.</p><p>You could, for example, now order a friend a <strong><a href="https://lyaness.myshopify.com/collections/two-serves-200ml/products/vegan-honey-old-fashioned-1">Vegan Honey Old Fashioned</a></strong><a href="https://lyaness.myshopify.com/collections/two-serves-200ml/products/vegan-honey-old-fashioned-1"> </a>(£22 for two serves, 29%) from top mixologist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/oct/18/ofm-awards-2015-best-place-to-drink-dandelyan">Ryan Chetiyawardana</a> of <a href="https://lyaness.myshopify.com/">Lyaness</a> or a whole bottle of the legendary Alessandro Palazzi’s <strong>No 3 Vesper Martini</strong> (<a href="https://www.bbr.com/products-10003000004-no-3-vesper-martini-bottled-cocktail-28-6%25">£29.95 for 50cl Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</a>, 28.6%).

<p>If you started a new job in 2020, or began working from home, you’re missing out on more than the Christmas party. Here’s why office friendships matter</p><p>You never forget your first. I met Abi in early 2009 when we were assistants on a fashion magazine. We sized each other up like a pair of cats on a suburban lawn, then quickly became inseparable. She: Mancunian, funny and forthright. Me: in her words, “Quite posh, aren’t you?”</p><p>We were on the bottom rung of a monthly publication that specialised in celebrities and style. It would be fair to say we were not great experts in either field. One aspect of the job involved going to parties to get quotes from famous people. At one, we attempted to interview a pop star, only for our confused interviewee to tell us she was in fact a makeup artist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/dec/11/hangovers-heartaches-horrible-meetings-why-we-all-need-work-wives">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Normally the boys will happily play on their consoles all day, every day, and treat the suggestion of an outing as a breach of their human rights</p><p>Being in lockdown during the winter, with young children, brings new challenges in terms of keeping them occupied. They would happily play on their consoles all day, every day, and I would in fact have a much easier weekend if I allowed them to do that. But then I have that nagging feeling that their brains are being dissolved, and that one day in the future, the police will notify me that my son has gone on a gun rampage that they have traced back to the day during the second lockdown in 2020 when they were allowed to play Grand Theft Auto.</p><p>What this means is that I tell the boys we are all going for a walk a bit later on, and they say that’s fine, because when you are six years old, “later on” feels like an eternity away. When it’s 9am, “this afternoon” feels like it will never arrive; you have oceans of time to relax and kill people on screen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/11/our-sons-willingly-agreed-to-a-national-trust-walk-is-it-stockholm-syndrome">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Being apart doesn’t mean you can’t be together – here’s how to ensure the whole family can join the festivities wherever they are …</p><p>From pulling crackers en masse to a frenzy of present opening under the tree, so many Christmas traditions are built on the premise of having everyone under one roof, if only for a few hours. And while the easing of lockdown restrictions over the festive period means it will be possible for households to meet up for a few days in limited numbers, many are still planning for immediate-family-only celebrations. For those, Christmas 2020 is a great opportunity to shake things up and make some genuinely one-off memories by finding new ways to share the day with siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents, wherever they may be.</p><p>For a start, make sure the grandparents are primed for an impromptu FaceTime, and that everyone knows how to schedule a Zoom. Hopefully, over the past year, everyone’s got the hang of “gallery view” and learned the importance of the mute button, but you might want to throw in some extra pointers for the grandparents, such as raising the screen to eye level to eradicate those huge nostrils and extra chins. It might also be wise to settle on a video calling app that all generations feel happy with – whether that’s Skype, Houseparty, Google Hangouts or WhatsApp video calls.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/dec/11/kids-and-grandparents-separated-at-christmas-five-ways-to-share-the-magic">Continue reading...</a>

## Experience: I was abandoned as a baby

<p>My foster parents took in more than 100 kids, but I was one of only two they adopted</p><p>I was hours old when my birth mother threw me away by a dumpster. She was a drug addict, I’ve since been told, and couldn’t handle looking after me. When I was discovered, the police called child services who immediately put me into foster care. My foster parents took in more than 100 foster kids during their lives, but I was one of only two they adopted. They were nearing 70, so adopting a newborn baby wasn’t part of their plans, but having seen the ordeal I’d been put through, they didn’t want me to go through the care system.</p><p>They lived in a small rural city in Florida where everyone knows everyone, so the kids at school had heard my story even before I had. They bullied me and called me Dumpster Baby. That’s when I had to talk with my father; when I was 10 he sat me down and told me about my birth situation. I thought: did somebody really throw me away? Am I trash or a person? It bothered me for a long time but I overcame it. I had a mother and father who loved me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/11/experience-i-was-abandoned-as-a-baby">Continue reading...</a>

## Can the UK deliver on the Covid vaccine rollout? | Stephen Buranyi

<p>The challenge of delivering vaccines on this scale are hard, but are firmly within the world of logistics, engineering, and politics</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The UK has become the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/02/pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine-wins-licence-for-use-in-the-uk">first country to approve</a> one of the coronavirus vaccines that the entire world has been desperately waiting for. And on Tuesday it delivered the first dose, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/08/coventry-woman-90-first-patient-to-receive-covid-vaccine-in-nhs-campaign">to 90-year-old Margaret Keenan</a> in Coventry. We should be very pleased about this. But, as with every other stage of the pandemic, the final stretch brings a new set of unprecedented challenges. The world is watching as the UK becomes the first test case of our collective ability to manufacture, ship, and deliver an entirely new class of vaccines, on a scale and speed that no previous vaccination drive in history has ever approached.</p><p>The thing everyone knows about the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/02/how-does-the-pfizerbiontech-covid-vaccine-work-and-who-will-get-it">Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine</a><strong> </strong>is that it needs to be extremely cold. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/22/mrna-vaccines-covid-signal-new-era-disease-prevention-science">mRNA</a> that makes up the vaccine payload is the same stuff your cells use to send short-lived genetic instructions. It’s a messenger that isn’t supposed to stick around, as temporally fragile as a Snap on Snapchat. The vaccine is happiest at -70C, and after thawing can be kept at between 4C and -8C – the temperature of a regular fridge – for just five days before it degrades.

## Expert by Roger Kneebone review – the value of expertise

<p>The pandemic has made the necessity of relying on experts evident to all ... this is a rich exploration of lifelong learning</p><p>Before the Brexit referendum in 2016, Michael Gove announced that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/09/michael-gove-experts-academics-vote">Britain had had enough of experts</a>, depicting them as out of touch and elitist. This anti-intellectualism became commonplace in the UK and the US, despite some notable Tory U-turns. With the unprecedented public health crisis of Covid-19, the expert is back in fashion. Virologists, epidemiologists, statisticians, politicians and members of the public share a language of information about the coronavirus, ranging from social distancing, self-isolation and lockdown to covidiot, covexit and Barnard Castle. But whose knowledge and expertise counts?</p><p>This question has a long and complex history that encompasses the meanings of “truth” as well as the evolution of the scientific method. The term “expert” comes from the mid-19th century, with its focus on objective truth, and the rise of the professions, especially as a white, male, scientific enterprise (and in contrast to feminised and “morally useful” art subjects). This hierarchy of science over humanities persists, though in the era of fake news, scientific expertise is apparently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/19/why-cant-we-agree-on-whats-true-anymore">up for grabs</a> since access to data is democratised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/11/expert-by-roger-kneebone-review-the-value-of-expertise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest in a Guardian Print Shop <a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture">series</a> featuring classic sports images. This week’s picture pays homage to the Argentinian maestro Diego Maradona, who died last month at the age of 60</p><p>Since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/25/diego-maradona-dies-one-of-greatest-footballers-of-all-time-argentina-world-cup-1986">Diego Maradona’s death in November</a>, countless tributes have been paid to the Argentinian maestro and World Cup winner from fellow icons within the game. His long-time rival Pelé wrote a poignant message on Instagram: “Many people loved to compare us all their lives. You were a genius that enchanted the world. A magician with the ball at his feet. A true legend … I want to say that you are incomparable.” His compatriot and mentee Lionel Messi wrote: “He leaves us but does not leave because Diego is eternal.” But it’s a quote from Maradona himself which seems most apt when recalling his famous exploits for <em>La Albiceleste</em>: “No matter what happens and no matter who is in charge, the No 10 shirt will always be mine.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/11/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-diego-maradona-forever-no-10">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For years, the Tories have used their power to game the system. But that won’t wash with the EU<br /></p><p>In politics, as in the rest of life, rules are often about power. Who sets them, who obeys them and who breaks them – and whether they get away with it – tells us a lot about where power lies. In Britain, with our unwritten and patched-together constitution, the rules of politics can be vague and poorly understood by voters, the media, and even some politicians.

<p>For this hospital doctor, the purity of the Hebrides and Orkney brings the solace he needs to carry on his busy city profession </p><p>One November, close to burnout, I left my job as a hospital doctor in Edinburgh for the Hebridean island of Barra. From the lee of an abandoned cottage, where I sheltered from the driving rain, the island at first seemed desolate, empty, solitary.</p><p>A headland stood over a broad bay of white sand chopped by relentless sallies of rolling grey waves. Down on the beach, the sands were sheened in a thin film of seawater which seemed neither to flow nor drain – a mirror over the earth, doubling the drama of the skies. I surprised two sea otters at play and picked up a bobbing audience of inquisitive seals that floated just offshore, following me as I made my way along the strandline. There were just a few hours of light to each day of the week I spent walking circuits of those beaches, but the purity and simplicity of the landscape – just hills, grass, sea, wind – lent a clarity to my mind that had been lacking for what felt like months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/dec/11/how-i-beat-burnout-with-trips-to-remote-scottish-islands">Continue reading...</a>

It was a strangely appropriate format for an industry that learned how to livestream as it weathered a total collapse in gigs and festivals, but despite the horrors, there was still plenty of brilliant and indeed cathartic music released. Pondering it all are Danielle Haim, singer with Haim, who are nominated for album of the year at the Grammys; Phoebe Bridgers, also heading to the Grammys with four nominations; British soul-jazz singer Lianne La Havas; emotive songwriter Moses Sumney; glam-pop star Declan McKenna; and British-Japanese pop sensation Rina Sawayama.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/11/oh-cool-i-dont-have-to-put-on-pants-stars-on-musics-year-of-chaos">Continue reading...</a>

It is bursting with vitality, creativity, passion and fun, and the young stars supercharge it with energy.</p><p>Newcomer Bukky Bakray plays an 11-year-old British-Nigerian girl in east London nicknamed Rocks, who has a smart kid brother, Emmanuel (wonderfully played by another great child actor, D’angelou Osei Kissiedu). Their mum is well meaning but has, as her outreach worker delicately puts it, issues managing her medication. One day she vanishes, leaving a note to Rocks telling her it is now her responsibility to look after Emmanuel. In this moment, Rocks has been upgraded to parent status, carer status, mum status, leapfrogging what she might have hoped would be a carefree late-teen or early twentysomething period and straight into the careworn age of adulthood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/11/the-best-films-of-2020-uk-no-6-rocks">Continue reading...</a>

Grey squirrels are active before dawn, and I wake to the rhythmic sound of the lid of the squirrel feeder creaking open and snapping shut as they take it in turns to pluck out a nut. Footage from my trail camera revealed that they are often joined in the half-light by our resident carrion crows and magpies.</p><p>While I’ve witnessed the magpies sidling up to the squirrels and tugging on their tails in an attempt to steal their food, they tend to give the crows a wide berth, picking at fallen scraps on the periphery of the feeding station while their self-assured cousins take their fill of the choicest offerings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/11/country-diary-carrion-crows-become-intensely-territorial">Continue reading...</a>

Covid-19 swept through Asia and into Europe and beyond, killing almost 2 million people and bringing the world’s economies to their knees. </p><p>The Guardian’s editor-in-chief, <strong>Katharine Viner</strong>,<strong> </strong>joins <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>to look back on a year in which reporters covered some huge breaking stories, including the killing of George Floyd and the global anti-racism movement Black Lives Matter. There was the US election in which the American people voted to remove Donald Trump. And there was the biggest story of all: the continuing climate crisis which, despite a pandemic-induced reduction in travel, only resulted in a 7% drop in global emissions. And all the while Britain hurtled inexorably towards an end-of-year Brexit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/11/guardian-editor-in-chief-katharine-viner-on-how-we-reported-2020-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
