I've been following these projects for a few weeks, and I wanted to share them with you. I know it's still hard to get your hands on the official Compute Module IO Board, but maybe you won't have to, if you're able to get your hands on one of these unique and awesome other boards!

Some of them are released under the Open Source Hardware License, so you could even build them or make improvements to them on your own. Other ones are still in concept or prototype phase, but whatever the case, I'm excited about all of them and will be tracking these and more new boards in this GitHub issue:
