Hades is an absolutely remarkable game that takes the commonly frustrating video game act of dying and somehow transforms it into an integral and enjoyable part of the experience. It builds upon everything developer Supergiant Games has done so far in Bastion, Transistor, and Pyre — intricate combat systems, amazing art and music, and a fantastic story. But its greatest success in my mind is how it takes the concept of death that is at the core of most roguelikes and expertly weaves it in with the actual story and flow of the gameplay.
