Ivermectin

https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/ivermectin.html#indicationsAndDoses

Invitro antiviral activity

Against a broad range of viruses

HIV, dengue, influenza, Zika virus

Invitro antiviral, SARS-CoV-2 activity

99.8% reduction in viral RNA after 48 h

Worldwide use for treating COVID-19

About 3.7 billion doses of ivermectin have been distributed globally over the past 30 years

EVMS CRITICAL CARE COVID-19 MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL 

https://www.evms.edu/media/evms_public/departments/internal_medicine/EVMS_Critical_Care_COVID-19_Protocol.pdf

Preexposure prophylaxis in high-risk patients

Postexposure prophylaxis

Symptomatic patients at home

Mildly symptomatic patients in hospital 

Progressive Respiratory symptoms
 
Ivermectin has emerged as the “wonder drug” to prophylaxis and treat COVID-19

Ivermectin inhibits viral replication and has potent anti-inflammatory properties 

There is the potential for serious drug-drug interaction

Additional, studies are urgently required to confirm these very impressive preliminary findings

Review of the Emerging Evidence Demonstrating the Efficacy of Ivermectin in the Prophylaxis and Treatment of COVID-19  (7th December)

Front Line COVID-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC) 

One Sentence Summary 

Review of recently available clinical trial results demonstrating efficacy of ivermectin in prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19. 

Use of Ivermectin Is Associated With Lower Mortality in Hospitalized Patients With Coronavirus Disease 2019

The ICON Study (October 2020, South Florida)

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7550891/

Research Question

Does ivermectin benefit hospitalized coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients?

Study Design and Methods

Consecutive patients hospitalized

Four hospitals in Florida

Confirmed COVID-19 

March 15 and May 11, 2020

Treated with or without ivermectin

Primary outcome

All-cause in-hospital mortality

Secondary outcomes, mortality in patients with severe pulmonary involvement, extubation rates for mechanically ventilated patients, length of stay

Severe pulmonary involvement

Need for Fio2 ≥ 50%, noninvasive ventilation

Invasive ventilation

Results from reviews

N = 280

Ivermectin treated = 173

Overall mortality 15%

Mortality with severe pulmonary involvement = 38.8%

Not given ivermectin = 107

Overall mortality 25% (OR, 0.52)

Mortality with severe pulmonary involvement = 80.7%

No significant differences were found in extubation rates or length of stay

Most patients in both groups also received hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, or both

Interpretation

Ivermectin treatment was associated with lower mortality during treatment of COVID-19 

Especially in patients with severe pulmonary involvement

Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings

US Food and Drug Administration

Recommended emergency approval, Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. 

Still needs to be formally approved by the FDA's vaccine chief

Operation Warp Speed, vaccine deliveries will begin with 24 hours of approval. 

Plans to rollout the vaccine are already underway. The United Parcel Service and FedEx are working with the government to send the vaccine to distribution staging areas.

Vaccine needs to be kept in a cold freezer and must be used quickly once it has thawed.

Pfizer, 6.4 million doses ready

Mass rollout, March or April

Sputnik and alcohol

Anna Popova, head of the consumer health watchdog

Komsomolskaya Pravda radio station

Stop drinking at least two weeks before first injections

Three weeks between shots

Continue to abstain for a further 42 days

Alcohol would reduce the body’s ability to build up immunity

It’s a strain on the body. If we want to be healthy and have a strong immune response, don’t drink alcohol

Alexander Gintsburg, vaccine developer

One glass of champagne won’t hurt anyone, not even your immune system

Prudent to reduce alcohol use by a reasonable amount while the body built up immunity, 
no need to give up completely.

Crucial however

Three days before and two days after

General advice

Mass rollout

Moscow’s Polyclinic No. 3

Moscow clinic, No. 3 Branch 2

Information, government officials or vaccine developers

Sputnik V vaccine efficacy exceeds 95 percent and it is safe

Moscow’s deputy mayor, Anastasia Rakova, Phase 3 report
