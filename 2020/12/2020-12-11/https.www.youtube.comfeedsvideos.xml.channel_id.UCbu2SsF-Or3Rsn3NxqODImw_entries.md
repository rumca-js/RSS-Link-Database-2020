Want to know just how different Cyberpunk 2077 looks on PlayStation 5? Check out this graphics comparison between a base PS4 model and PS5. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunning game… if you're playing it on the right systems. It's being hailed as "the new Crysis" on PC, and you'll need a powerful graphics card to be able to run CD Projekt Red's latest at its highest settings. But little footage of the game was shown on console pre-release.

Now that Cyberpunk 2077 has been released, we can finally dig deeper into its console versions. In this video, we compare the game running on PlayStation 5 to the base PlayStation 4 model to see just how much difference Sony's brand new console makes. It should be noted that the version running on PS5 is actually the PS4 version of the game, playable through backwards compatibility. A patch to upgrade the game for PlayStation 5 will be released next year.

Cyberpunk 2077 is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Stadia.

At this year's Game Awards, we got a sneak peek at upcoming PS5 and Xbox Series X games like the Perfect Dark reboot, The Callisto Protocol, and a brand new Mass Effect. The Generation Next gang talk about their favorites.

The Game Awards 2020 featured a ton of announcements, ranging from world premiers of new games to gameplay teasers for already anticipated titles. And plenty of those announcements had to deal with games coming to Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.

On this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor provide their immediate reactions to what went down at The Game Awards. The trio also talk through their respective impressions of the show as a whole and how it has contributed to the conversation surrounding the new generation of consoles--from the reveal of Xbox Series X to the advertisement of upcoming AAA titles and indie titles coming exclusively to the new consoles in 2021 and beyond, including The Callisto Protocol and Perfect Dark.

Generation Next is a weekly video series focused on discussing Xbox Series X|S and PS5. Sometimes that means sitting down for a serious discussion and other times that means mixing in some good points among lots of silly bants. It's usually the latter.
