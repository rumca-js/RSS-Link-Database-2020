Mary’s Place provides safe, inclusive shelter and services that support women, children and families on their journey out of homelessness. Particularly during this pandemic, the safest place for a family to be is in their own home. Whether in shelter or a car or a tent, Mary’s Place priority is to help families find housing as quickly as possible, and to stay housed through these challenging economic times.
