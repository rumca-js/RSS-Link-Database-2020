For one thing, selling your publishing rights or your master recordings is commonplace among artists of a certain stature, netting them huge lump sums in the process and giving the buyer ownership of the kind of songs that people are clearly going to be playing and recording cover versions of for the rest of eternity: everyone from Elton John to Stevie Nicks has done it.</p><p>And for another, it\u2019s a move very much in keeping with Dylan\u2019s sharp business sense.

But, in fairness, it\u2019s hard to see how his catalogue\u2019s new owners might exploit his songs in a way that the man himself hasn\u2019t already done in recent years. A 2015 article in Variety claimed Dylan\u2019s songs had already appeared more than 500 times in films and on television, a state of affairs that may have had something to do with the fact that Dylan himself, in contrast to some of his peers, was apparently highly amenable to their use. \u201cTo me there\u2019s literally nothing more simple than clearing a Bob Dylan song,\u201d said Thomas Golubi\u0107, a music supervisor known for his work on Breaking Bad.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/07/bob-dylan-rights-sale-part-freewheelin-approach-business\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/07/bob-dylan-rights-sale-part-freewheelin-approach-business", "date_published": "2020-12-07 16:29:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Doug Scott obituary", "description": "<p>First Englishman to climb Everest who dedicated his later years to Buddhism and helping the people of Nepal</p><p>Doug Scott, who has died aged 79 from cancer, was the first Englishman to climb Everest, but it was what happened afterwards that made him famous in the mountaineering world.</p><p>Scott and his Scottish partner, Dougal Haston, were part of Chris Bonington\u2019s 1975 expedition to climb Everest the \u201chard way\u201d, via the south-west face.
