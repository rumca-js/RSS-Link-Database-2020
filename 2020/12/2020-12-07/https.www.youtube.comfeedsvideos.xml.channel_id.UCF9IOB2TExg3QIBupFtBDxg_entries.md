COVID-19 Results Briefing: the United States of America 

December 4, 2020 

Cases and deaths continue to increase steadily

Reference scenario, expected scale-up of vaccination

Cumulative deaths by April 1, 539,000

Peak daily deaths, 3,000 in mid-to-late January

Vaccination is likely to speed the transition back to normal later in the year

but will prevent only 9,000 deaths by April 1

A further 14,000 lives can be saved with more rapid vaccine scale-up targeting high-risk individuals

Death rate could be higher, State governors implementing packages of mandates as hospital stress becomes high

Scaling up mask use to 95% can save 66,000 lives by April 1

Current situation 

Last week, cases + 165,200 per day

Week before, + 145,900 per day

Last week, deaths + 1,660 per day

Week before, deaths + 1,470

COVID-19 the number 1 cause of death in the United States of America this week

White House’s coronavirus task force to governors, Sunday

 We are in a very dangerous place due to the current, extremely high covid baseline 

and limited hospital capacity.

Fear — has dulled

Many people either simply don’t care or no longer believe in the dangers posed by the virus

We’re facing a campaign of disinformation and denial

The impact in January will be very, very large

Our fear is that in January and February, the health system won’t be able to bear it

WHO

Jun.08 -- Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit

Transmission of the coronavirus by people who aren’t showing symptoms is "very rare.”

It is rare for a asymptomatic person to transmit on to a second individual

We need to follow the symptomatic cases
