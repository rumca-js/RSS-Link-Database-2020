By January 2020, Black Pumas were Grammy nominees (Best New Artist) and they played the First Avenue Mainroom, headlining The Current's 15th anniversary show. Today, Black Pumas are nominated in three Grammy categories (Record of the Year, American Roots Performance and Album of the Year). Recordings of Black Pumas' live performances at The Current will feature in our upcoming On-Air Fest. Before then, watch three songs from that very first Black Pumas studio session from July 2019.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Black Moon Rising\"\n3:46 \"Fire\"\n7:39 \"Colors\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nEric Burton \u2013 vocals, guitar\nAdrian Quesada - guitar\nVince Chiarito \u2013 bass\nJaRon Marshall \u2013 keys \nAngela Miller \u2013 backing vocals\nJohn Speice \u2013 drums \nAJ Hayes \u2013 backing vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Mary Mathis\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Adam Biel\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/07/21/black-pumas-perform-in-the-current-studio \n2020 set at First Avenue: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/01/19/watch-black-pumas-headlining-set-at-the-currents-15th-anniversary-show\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#blackpumas", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANwqaX4NLCI", "date_published": "2020-12-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
