In July 2019, Austin, Texas, band Black Pumas visited our studio to play a three-song set ahead of a gig at the 7th Street Entry in Minneapolis. By January 2020, Black Pumas were Grammy nominees (Best New Artist) and they played the First Avenue Mainroom, headlining The Current's 15th anniversary show. Today, Black Pumas are nominated in three Grammy categories (Record of the Year, American Roots Performance and Album of the Year). Recordings of Black Pumas' live performances at The Current will feature in our upcoming On-Air Fest. Before then, watch three songs from that very first Black Pumas studio session from July 2019.
