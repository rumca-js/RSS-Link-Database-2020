<p>While the performances are strong, this new adaptation about mysterious goings-on at a convent school lacks suspense</p><p>What is it about Rumer Godden’s 1939 tale of a band of nuns isolated in the Himalayas that attracts film-makers? The fact they are trying to set up a school in an erotica-lined palace that previously housed a harem, with nothing to distract them but the handsome agent of the Indian general who owns it? We may never know.</p><p>Anyway, here is Black Narcissus (BBC One), made famous by the 1947 film starring Deborah Kerr, in the form of a three-part miniseries. It stars Gemma Arterton in Kerr’s role as the ambitious Sister Clodagh, the youngest sister superior the Anglican convent has had and the driving force behind the move to establish the mission in the mountains. The mother superior is played, all too briefly but gloriously, by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/sep/10/dame-diana-rigg-obituary">Diana Rigg</a>, in one of her last roles. She knows trouble when she sees it and makes sure – or tries to make sure – the prideful Clodagh is sent off with people who will keep her in check, as well as have the wherewithal to turn an abandoned mansion into a shining beacon for the faith.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/27/black-narcisssus-review-erotic-gothic-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

## Brexit deal is a rubbish gift for a gullible public | Letters

<p>Readers respond to the trade and security deal struck with the EU on Christmas Eve</p><p>I find myself in disagreement with the Guardian’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/25/the-guardian-view-on-brexit-in-a-time-of-covid-crisis-what-crisis" title="">editorial</a> where it argues that Keir Starmer is “right to back the deal”. Under its last leader, Labour failed the British people by not wholeheartedly opposing Brexit. Had Jeremy Corbyn mustered the commitment to lead the remain cause, Labour might well not have lost anything like the 50-odd leave seats it did in the last election. Labour is, thankfully, under new management and we know where the hearts of Keir Starmer, Anneliese Dodds and Emily Thornberry lie. They are Europeans, through and through. They must now have the courage of their convictions. They know that Brexit is fuelled by dubious money, dodgy argument, a focus on spurious “sovereignty” and elements of racism.</p><p>A comparison of the speeches of Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson summed up why Christmas Eve was such a shaming day. Von der Leyen spoke with feeling, vision and deep seriousness, Johnson with his usual silliness. Britain needs to repair the damage as soon as it can. It needs to rejoin the EU at the first opportunity, and Labour must make the case unequivocally. It must begin by abstaining in the vote on what must be seen as solely a Tory deal.<br /><strong>David Curtis</strong><br /><em>Solihull, West Midlands</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/27/brexit-deal-is-a-rubbish-gift-for-a-gullible-public">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson’s run of bad decisions on Brexit and Covid have their roots in a saga of elite entitlement and superficiality</p><p>When the novelist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/18/le-carre-death-loss-public-figures-intimate-mourn-mourning">John le Carré died</a> earlier this month, among the passages quoted by journalists was a short excerpt from <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2020/12/john-le-carre-england-politics/617379/">The Secret Pilgrim</a>, published in 1990. In the book, the words are spoken by Le Carré’s fondly loved character George Smiley. “﻿The privately educated Englishman – and Englishwoman, if you will allow me – is the greatest dissembler on Earth,” he says. “Was, is now and ever shall be for as long as our disgraceful school system remains intact. Nobody will charm you so glibly, disguise his feelings from you better, cover his tracks more skilfully or find it harder to confess to you that he’s been a damned fool.”</p><p>The words are a cutting summary of the far-off era of upper class treachery and cold war subterfuge, but also fit the less romantic time of Brexit, the pandemic and a Conservative party whose leadership by two public schoolboys has so pushed us into disaster. Therein lies a huge part of the national tragedy that, amid <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/21/lorry-drivers-fear-being-stuck-in-dover-for-christmas-as-borders-close">stranded lorries</a>, a shamefully high death toll and some of the greatest peacetime blunders this country has ever made, has recently seemed to be reaching some kind of awful climax. Of late, some of the best writing about the mess we are in has focused on Boris Johnson’s character flaws, which are undoubtedly a big part of the tale. But what has been rather less examined is the fact that his shortcomings blur into a much longer story about our longstanding ruling class, and its habit of creating crisis after crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/history-britain-ruling-class-created-crisis-boris-johnson-brexit-covid">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Every note pulses with life and warmth': pianist Boris Giltburg on Beethoven

<p>Beethoven’s 250th anniversary was not the year any of us were expecting, but, as symphony cycles and opera productions were cancelled, his music spoke to us in deeper, more intimate ways. </p><p>Recently, I experienced one of those moments when disparate bits of knowledge suddenly realign, and a connection appears, as glaringly obvious as it was hidden a moment ago. I was listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUdpQJB-b2A">Fritz Wunderlich’s glorious rendition of Beethoven’s song cycle, An die ferne Geliebte</a> (To the distant beloved). Those six songs are an outpouring of Romantic lyrical longing felt by the protagonist, facing the unbridgeable distance between him and his beloved.</p><p>If it had not been ennobled by the purity of Beethoven’s music, the cycle’s poetic imagery could have been banal. The verses speak of hillsides and valleys, birds and brooks, clouds and sunsets, all invoked as symbols of the singer’s longing, or as potential messengers from him to his beloved. Yet in the sixth and last song, a stronger link between them is found – music itself. The singer asks his beloved to sing the songs he himself had sung, artlessly, from the fullness of his heart. Then, he says, whatever has separated them will fade and their hearts will find each other. Beethoven expresses this thought first with a heartachingly beautiful melody, loving and tender, and then with near-delirious exuberance, depicting the joining of hearts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/27/every-note-pulses-with-life-and-warmth-boris-giltburg-beethoven-250th-">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The novelist’s hit debut, a witty spin on race, feminism and sex based on her time as a nanny in New York, has even won fans among her former employers…</p><p>This time last year, Kiley Reid was a tantalising rumour, the truth of which was known only to her publishers and to the film company that had optioned her debut novel two years before it was ready to see the light of day. When <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/07/such-a-fun-age-by-kiley-reid-review">Such a Fun Age</a></em> was published – on New Year’s Eve in the US and a week later in the UK – the rumour checked out: here was a smart comedy of manners, which treated interracial relationships of the early 21st century with the sort of needling wit that Jane Austen had applied to class 200 years earlier.</p><p>It was the start of a year in which Reid seems to have been travelling in the opposite direction to the rest of the world. By the time the Covid pandemic shut everything down, she had introduced the novel to 19 cities, including London. Reese Witherspoon had picked it for her book club; in July, it was longlisted for the Booker prize. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/kiley-reid-interview-such-a-fun-age">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Iron Mike’s sincerity and humility turned what might have been a cynical money grab into an unlikely moment of inspiration that underscored his endurance in our sporting consciousness</p><p>When Mike Tyson announced he was fighting an eight-round exhibition against Roy Jones Jr over Thanksgiving weekend after floating the idea of a comeback <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CADjPgOl_Nw/">on Instagram</a> for most of 2020, you’d have been forgiven if you dismissed the whole thing as a cynical money grab.</p><p>Nostalgia is a powerful narcotic. And the unspoken allure of old-timers exhibitions like Tyson v Jones is that people are paying not for the product on offer but a memory – a feeling. Embedded in the sales pitch of a Tyson fight was the promise of transporting the customer even briefly to a fairer, better time that mostly exists in our memories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/27/mike-tyson-comeback-notable-us-athletes-2020">Continue reading...</a>

## I'm a consultant in infectious diseases. 'Long Covid' is anything but a mild illness | Joanna Herman

<p>Nine months on from the virus, I am seriously debilitated. This is how the new NHS clinics need to help thousands of us</p><p>With the excitement of the Covid vaccine’s arrival, it may be easy to forget and ignore those of us with “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/15/long-covid-what-we-know-so-far">long Covid</a>”, who are struggling to reclaim our previous, pre-viral lives and continue to live with debilitating symptoms. Even when the NHS has managed the herculean task of vaccinating the nation, Covid-19 and the new mutant variants of the virus will continue to circulate, leaving more people at risk of long Covid. Data from a King’s College London study in September suggested <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/08/60000-may-have-long-covid-for-more-than-three-months-uk-study">as many as 60,000</a> people in the UK could be affected, but the latest statistics from the Office for National Statistics suggest it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/16/long-covid-alarm-as-21-report-symptoms-after-five-weeks">could be much higher</a>. </p><p>I was acutely ill in March, though – like many people with long Covid – mine was defined as a “mild” case not requiring admission to hospital. Nine months on, I am seriously debilitated, with crashing post-exertional fatigue, often associated with chest pains. On bad days, my brain feels like it doesn’t want to function, even a conversation can be too much. I have no risk factors, I’m in my 50s, and have always been fit, but remain too unwell to work – ironically as a consultant in infectious diseases. Watching the pandemic unfold from the sidelines when I should have been working in the thick of it has only added to the frustration of my protracted illness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/consultant-infectious-diseases-long-covid-not-mild-illness-seriously-debilitated-new-clinics">Continue reading...</a>

<p> Looking for a more positive new year resolution? From a Shirley Jackson short story to Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s 30-minute Ted talk, nourish your mind with our one-a-day selection of literary treats <br /></p><p>Our revels now are ended and January looms, with its exhortations to get fit, lose weight, dry out. So here’s a radical alternative diet: instead of depriving yourself, how about making it a month of treats – but feeding your brain instead of your face? Our one-a-day calendar will take you into magical realms of poetry and prose, argument and imagination. It will transport you to some places you always wanted to explore, but couldn’t find the time, and to others you never knew existed, where you will find strange and wonderful things.</p><p>In fact, this calendar very nearly didn’t happen because I kept disappearing down rabbit-holes so deep and fascinating that, had I been the white rabbit himself, someone would have had to drag me out by the ears. Some entries – such as John Huston’s film of Malcolm Lowry’s mescal-fuelled modernist masterpiece <em>Under the Volcano </em>(20 January) – come with the authority of a full year’s leisurely burrowing (it is among the <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/lists/100-great-films-streaming-netflix-amazon-prime-updated">BFI’s list of 100 great films</a> to watch on Netflix and Amazon Prime, which was a comfort and joy through lockdown, and is handily still being updated).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/feed-your-soul-the-31-day-literary-diet-for-january-2021-culture-books">Continue reading...</a>

In moments I’m forced to do nothing, I find this clarity.”</p><p>It’s 10am on a grey December morning when we meet over Zoom and her schedule, when she takes me through it, sounds exhausting.

Whether we’re talking about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/black-lives-matter-movement">Black Lives Matter</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19</a>, a lot of the new nonfiction coming our way will speak insistently to the present moment – to the point where some readers, fighting unease, may welcome the relative tranquillity of a fat life of the artist Francis Bacon, in the form of <em>Revelations</em>, Mark Stevens and Annalyn Swan’s 880-page biography (William Collins, January); or, rather more genteel, <em>The Adventures of Miss Barbara Pym</em> by Paula Byrne (William Collins, April).</p><p>It will also be much more diverse – which is where we’ll begin. In January, Chatto publishes <em>Begin Again: James Baldwin’s America and </em><em>Its Urgent Lessons for Today</em>, in which Eddie S Glaude Jr, chair of the Department of African American Studies at Princeton University, tries to fathom how the author of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.jamesbaldwin">Go Tell It On the Mountain</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.jamesbaldwin"> </a>managed, against the odds, to keep faith in the idea of a more just future. A bestseller in the US, this urgent, deeply interesting book will be followed by <em>Three Mothers</em><em> </em>(William Collins, February), in which Anna Malaika Tubbs looks at how the women who raised Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and (again) James Baldwin helped to shape America; <em>Raceless</em>, by Georgina Lawton (Sphere, February), a memoir of growing up black in a white Anglo-Irish family; and Musa Okwonga’s <em>One of Them</em> (Unbound, April), an account of the author’s experiences as a black boy at Eton. Also hotly anticipated is <em>Empireland</em> (Viking, January), a meticulous look at the effects of imperialism on British life and history from Sathnam Sanghera, best known for his memoir <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/05/boy-with-the-topknot-sathnam-sanghera-bbc-drama-mental-illness">The Boy with the Topknot</a></em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/nonfiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our unstoppable British strain shows that yes, we can prosper outside the EU</p><p>If the United Kingdom can take one positive thing from the Covid-19 crisis, it is that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/22/the-new-strain-of-coronavirus-that-has-cancelled-christmas">most powerful and virulent version of the virus</a> is perceived globally as being British, faster and stronger than its puny foreign counterparts. And the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, has rightly declared this the sort of thing that makes our island nation “a much better country than every single one of the others”. Up yours Delors! Take back control!!</p><p>Due to festive blockages, I had to file this “so-called” “funny topical column” six days ago, though I’m not under as much stress this week as Boris Johnson’s anal sphincter.

## Fiction to look out for in 2021

<p>With a host of dazzling second novels in the offing, plus the return of big hitters such as Kazuo Ishiguro and Jon McGregor, 2021 is shaping up to be a special year</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/nonfiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021">Nonfiction to look out for in 2021</a></li></ul><p>2020 ended up being a decent year for the publishing trade, at least as far as book sales went. Perhaps we also learned to cherish our bookshops and literary festivals – vital elements of our cultural lives whose absence for much of the year was painful to endure. The loss of these forums for discovering new books caused publishers to delay the release of many titles until 2021. So it’s a massive year of fiction ahead, meaning that I’ll concentrate here on books published in the first six months (with a brief nod to autumn titles from Jonathan Franzen, Richard Powers, Jennifer Egan, Colson Whitehead and a new Sebastian Faulks novel, <em>Snow Country</em><em> </em>(Hutchinson), coming in September). I’ll also leave first novels to the <em>Observer New Review</em>’s superb debut feature.</p><p>First up, I’m struck by the fact that two of the best American novels of the year are written by Brits. Tahmima Anam’s <em>The Startup Wife</em> (Canongate, June) is a brilliant and trenchant portrait of hi-tech America’s frat-boy misogyny, and Jonathan Lee is quietly becoming one of the best young novelists on either side of the Atlantic. His fourth book, <em>The Great Mistake</em><em> </em>(Granta, June), is a sweeping historical novel that is also a gripping mystery. As far as American novels by actual Americans go, there’s <em>We Run the Tides</em> (Atlantic, February) by Vendela Vida, a dreamily evocative story of California, adolescence and grief. Also look out for <em>The Committed</em> (Black Cat, March) by Viet Thanh Nguyen, the lyrical sequel to his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/12/the-sympathizer-viet-thanh-nguyen-review-debut">Pulitzer-winning debut, </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/12/the-sympathizer-viet-thanh-nguyen-review-debut">The Sympathiser</a>.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021">Continue reading...</a>

## Trump fed our worst instincts. His global legacy is toxic and immoral

<p>The US president rampaged across the world, leaving a trail of random destruction, division and conflict in his wake</p><p>How much damage did Donald Trump do around the world, can it be repaired, and did he accomplish anything of lasting significance? Assessing the international legacy of the 45th US president is not so much a conventional survey of achievement and failure. It’s more like tracking the rampages of a cantankerous rogue elephant that leaves a trail of random destruction and shattered shibboleths in its wake. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/23/donald-trumps-latest-wave-of-pardons-includes-paul-manafort-and-charles-kunsher" title="">Last week’s wild pardoning spree</a> is a case in point.</p><p>First, the big picture. Trump’s confrontational manner, combined with his “America First” agenda, seriously undermined transatlantic relations and US global leadership. Joe Biden promises to set this right, but it will not be easy. France’s Emmanuel Macron exploited US introspection to advance ideas of European autonomy and integration. Leaders in the UK, Hungary and Poland cynically flattered Trump for their own political purposes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/trump-fed-our-worst-instincts-his-global-legacy-is-toxic-and-immoral">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The entire clan will have assembled on Zoom, brother-in-law Jimmy will have played his Afrobeat LPs… But despite the upheaval it was just as I would have predicted</p><p>This week I should be telling you what I got up to this Christmas but, due to the wonders of seasonal deadlines, I’m filing this piece some time before anything has actually happened. I mean, you don’t know me so I could just lie, but I feel like that would be against the spirit of this column, if not Christmas itself.</p><p>Instead, I’m going to make some predictions of whatwill have come to pass in the past week, since I think I’ve a good chance of nailing it. I’d certainly be more accurate than that scary bloke from <em>A Christmas Carol</em> whose skills as a prophet have always bugged me. Unless I’ve greatly misinterpreted that story – and by this I obviously mean the infinitely superior Muppets version – his whole shtick appears to have been “loads of terrible stuff will happen, unless you stop being a brat”. To me, this marks him out as less of a mystical herald, and more an Irish mammy in a grim reaper costume.

Back in those days, we got exercised over airlines failing to pay compensation for delayed flights, obscure restrictions on train tickets and recalcitrant retailers. Then came Covid.

Retailers have spent much of the year shut by government decree, and who rides trains any more?</p><p>I’m ambivalent about naming and shaming companies that face ruin.

<p>Photographer Carolyn Drake finally found a way to capture the town she had fallen for after she joined the local knit club</p><p>Water Valley in Mississippi is a town of about 3,000 people. People move there or stay there because they fall in love with the gothic revival Victorian houses, which exist in various states of renovation or decay. One of those people was photographer <a href="https://carolyndrake.com/">Carolyn Drake</a>, who settled in Water Valley a few years ago, having returned from a decade of travelling in Russia and Asia, including a spell living and photographing in Uighur villages on the edge of the Taklamakan desert.</p><p>Drake spent two years in Water Valley hardly picking up her camera. She wasn’t sure how to photograph the place without it looking like a New Yorker’s view of “the south”. It was only after she became part of a knitting circle, an insider, sitting on her friend Katharine’s porch drinking IPA, stitching rugs, listening to true crime podcasts, that she found a way to do that. <em>Knit Club</em>, her strange and powerful book of photographs of the women of Water Valley, is the result.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/dec/27/the-big-picture-the-women-of-water-valley-mississippi">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There were plenty of dark clouds for our restaurant critic in 2020, but a few spectacular silver linings, too</p><p>A chilly Saturday night in February and I am walking wide-eyed along London’s Gerrard Street, staring into brightly lit Chinese restaurants which should be crammed but instead are not. Waiters, who normally make feeding the crowds look like a deft contact sport, stand still, amid the vacant chairs. I do not know it yet, but this is the true beginning of 2020.</p><p>I was there to review a branch of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/feb/23/four-seasons-london-an-act-of-solidarity-that-also-gets-me-roast-duck" title="">Four Seasons</a>, one of my favourite restaurants in Chinatown, where they serve pork belly that boasts crackling with an echoing crunch, and an addictively burnished Cantonese roast duck. My review was meant as an act of solidarity with the entire Chinese restaurant sector, which had endured a racist backlash because of reports of some virus thousands of miles away in Wuhan. What I didn’t know then was that, within six weeks, all those restaurants wouldn’t just be short on custom. They would be shuttered, along with every other hospitality business in the UK. Windows would be boarded up, staff furloughed or laid off altogether. Forget showing solidarity with one corner of the industry. It would be time to get behind the entirety of the sector and the millions of people who work in it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/27/jay-rayner-a-year-of-dining-out-and-in">Continue reading...</a>
