Labour is, thankfully, under new management and we know where the hearts of Keir Starmer, Anneliese Dodds and Emily Thornberry lie. They are Europeans, through and through.

But what has been rather less examined is the fact that his shortcomings blur into a much longer story about our longstanding ruling class, and its habit of creating crisis after crisis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/history-britain-ruling-class-created-crisis-boris-johnson-brexit-covid\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/27/history-britain-ruling-class-created-crisis-boris-johnson-brexit-covid", "date_published": "2020-12-27 15:08:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'Every note pulses with life and warmth': pianist Boris Giltburg on Beethoven", "description": "<p>Beethoven\u2019s 250th anniversary was not the year any of us were expecting, but, as symphony cycles and opera productions were cancelled, his music spoke to us in deeper, more intimate ways. </p><p>Recently, I experienced one of those moments when disparate bits of knowledge suddenly realign, and a connection appears, as glaringly obvious as it was hidden a moment ago. I was listening to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUdpQJB-b2A\">Fritz Wunderlich\u2019s glorious rendition of Beethoven\u2019s song cycle, An die ferne Geliebte</a> (To the distant beloved). Those six songs are an outpouring of Romantic lyrical longing felt by the protagonist, facing the unbridgeable distance between him and his beloved.</p><p>If it had not been ennobled by the purity of Beethoven\u2019s music, the cycle\u2019s poetic imagery could have been banal. The verses speak of hillsides and valleys, birds and brooks, clouds and sunsets, all invoked as symbols of the singer\u2019s longing, or as potential messengers from him to his beloved. Yet in the sixth and last song, a stronger link between them is found \u2013 music itself. The singer asks his beloved to sing the songs he himself had sung, artlessly, from the fullness of his heart. Then, he says, whatever has separated them will fade and their hearts will find each other. Beethoven expresses this thought first with a heartachingly beautiful melody, loving and tender, and then with near-delirious exuberance, depicting the joining of hearts.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/27/every-note-pulses-with-life-and-warmth-boris-giltburg-beethoven-250th-\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/27/every-note-pulses-with-life-and-warmth-boris-giltburg-beethoven-250th-", "date_published": "2020-12-27 15:00:47+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Kiley Reid: 'The premise that literary fiction has to be a drag is so silly'", "description": "<p>The novelist\u2019s hit debut, a witty spin on race, feminism and sex based on her time as a nanny in New York, has even won fans among her former employers\u2026</p><p>This time last year, Kiley Reid was a tantalising rumour, the truth of which was known only to her publishers and to the film company that had optioned her debut novel two years before it was ready to see the light of day.

In moments I\u2019m forced to do nothing, I find this clarity.\u201d</p><p>It\u2019s 10am on a grey December morning when we meet over Zoom and her schedule, when she takes me through it, sounds exhausting. Her lockdowns have been <em>busy</em>. She\u2019s written two books since the pandemic started and has kept up her popular wellness podcast, <a href=\"https://www.officialfearnecotton.com/news/2018/2/26/happy-place-podcast\" title=\"\">Happy Place</a>, alongside her weekly Radio 2 show. And though the second instalment of her annual summer wellness event, <a href=\"https://www.happyplacefestival.com/\" title=\"\">Happy Place Festival</a>, could have become another Covid casualty, Cotton and her team took the programme online. She juggled all this with home schooling her kids.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/27/fearne-cotton-interview-observer-magazine-i-have-found-clarity\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/27/fearne-cotton-interview-observer-magazine-i-have-found-clarity", "date_published": "2020-12-27 10:00:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Nonfiction to look out for in 2021", "description": "<p>Biographies of Philip Roth and DH Lawrence, the curious death of Robert Maxwell, and dispatches from the Covid frontline </p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021\">Fiction to look out for in 2021</a></li></ul><p>Publishing can feel slow, even stately, at times, and not only because good books take a long time to write.

In January, Chatto publishes <em>Begin Again: James Baldwin\u2019s America and </em><em>Its Urgent Lessons for Today</em>, in which Eddie S Glaude Jr, chair of the Department of African American Studies at Princeton University, tries to fathom how the author of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.jamesbaldwin\">Go Tell It On the Mountain</a></em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/nov/15/fiction.jamesbaldwin\"> </a>managed, against the odds, to keep faith in the idea of a more just future. A bestseller in the US, this urgent, deeply interesting book will be followed by <em>Three Mothers</em><em> </em>(William Collins, February), in which Anna Malaika Tubbs looks at how the women who raised Martin Luther King Jr, Malcolm X and (again) James Baldwin helped to shape America; <em>Raceless</em>, by Georgina Lawton (Sphere, February), a memoir of growing up black in a white Anglo-Irish family; and Musa Okwonga\u2019s <em>One of Them</em> (Unbound, April), an account of the author\u2019s experiences as a black boy at Eton. Also hotly anticipated is <em>Empireland</em> (Viking, January), a meticulous look at the effects of imperialism on British life and history from Sathnam Sanghera, best known for his memoir <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/nov/05/boy-with-the-topknot-sathnam-sanghera-bbc-drama-mental-illness\">The Boy with the Topknot</a></em>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/nonfiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/nonfiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021", "date_published": "2020-12-27 10:00:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Art: Laura Cumming's 10 best of 2020", "description": "<p>Our critic\u2019s picks of the year, from blockbuster shows to an essential virtual tour, the Arctic to artichokes\u2026</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/27/music-kitty-empire-10-best-of-2020\">Music: Kitty Empire\u2019s 10 best of 2020</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/observer-critics-review-of-2020\">The Observer critics\u2019 review of 2020 in full</a></li></ul><p>1. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/oct/04/artemisia-review-overwhelmingly-present\">Artemisia</a></strong><br />National Gallery, London; October-24 January 2021 (<a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/artemisia\">temporarily closed</a>)<br />Non-stop theatre from the magnificently original and dynamic Italian baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi, who seems to live inside every role she depicts: lover, outraged victim, nation-saving heroine.</p><p>2. <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/mar/22/titian-love-desire-death-review-national-gallery\">Titian: Love, Desire, Death</a></strong><br />National Gallery, London; March-17 January 2021 (<a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/exhibitions/titian-love-desire-death\">temporarily closed</a>)<br />Golden light, flailing bodies, surging souls and skies: Titian\u2019s transformations of mythological scenes from Ovid are some of the greatest pictures ever painted.

Perhaps we also learned to cherish our bookshops and literary festivals \u2013 vital elements of our cultural lives whose absence for much of the year was painful to endure. The loss of these forums for discovering new books caused publishers to delay the release of many titles until 2021. So it\u2019s a massive year of fiction ahead, meaning that I\u2019ll concentrate here on books published in the first six months (with a brief nod to autumn titles from Jonathan Franzen, Richard Powers, Jennifer Egan, Colson Whitehead and a new Sebastian Faulks novel, <em>Snow Country</em><em> </em>(Hutchinson), coming in September). I\u2019ll also leave first novels to the <em>Observer New Review</em>\u2019s superb debut feature.</p><p>First up, I\u2019m struck by the fact that two of the best American novels of the year are written by Brits. Tahmima Anam\u2019s <em>The Startup Wife</em> (Canongate, June) is a brilliant and trenchant portrait of hi-tech America\u2019s frat-boy misogyny, and Jonathan Lee is quietly becoming one of the best young novelists on either side of the Atlantic. His fourth book, <em>The Great Mistake</em><em> </em>(Granta, June), is a sweeping historical novel that is also a gripping mystery. As far as American novels by actual Americans go, there\u2019s <em>We Run the Tides</em> (Atlantic, February) by Vendela Vida, a dreamily evocative story of California, adolescence and grief. Also look out for <em>The Committed</em> (Black Cat, March) by Viet Thanh Nguyen, the lyrical sequel to his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/12/the-sympathizer-viet-thanh-nguyen-review-debut\">Pulitzer-winning debut, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/12/the-sympathizer-viet-thanh-nguyen-review-debut\">The Sympathiser</a>.</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/27/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2021", "date_published": "2020-12-27 10:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Trump fed our worst instincts.

My review was meant as an act of solidarity with the entire Chinese restaurant sector, which had endured a racist backlash because of reports of some virus thousands of miles away in Wuhan. What I didn\u2019t know then was that, within six weeks, all those restaurants wouldn\u2019t just be short on custom. They would be shuttered, along with every other hospitality business in the UK. Windows would be boarded up, staff furloughed or laid off altogether. Forget showing solidarity with one corner of the industry. It would be time to get behind the entirety of the sector and the millions of people who work in it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/27/jay-rayner-a-year-of-dining-out-and-in\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/27/jay-rayner-a-year-of-dining-out-and-in", "date_published": "2020-12-27 06:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The menopause is ruining my sex life.
