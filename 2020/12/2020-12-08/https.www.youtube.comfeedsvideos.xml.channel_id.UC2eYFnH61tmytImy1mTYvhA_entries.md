I was gifted a Lenovo ThinkPad travel keyboard which I've been enjoying a lot. Although they're somewhat harder to find nowadays, the build is of that classic ThinkPad caliber and it is extremely light and usable. With the TrackPoint, I can use this thing at the very long length of its cord and still have a keyboard and mouse.

It works out of the box on Linux, but the main issues were the lack of a Windows key (which is easily remapped in my case), but there were also some minor key roll-over problems. Altogether I still like it enough that I might just starting using it as a real-life regular keyboard on my desk.
