An average peasant that\u2019s just trying to get by and live your life in a country that has had a very chaotic history recently. The Russian Revolution just happened in 1917. Everyone stole what they could for survival and for their own personal gain.\n\nThis is the Economics of the Russian Mafia. One of the most unique organized crime groups in history, forged in the gulags of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Russian Mafia is very much a byproduct of Russia\u2019s history. This is also what makes the Russian Mafia, AKA the Vory different from the Yakuza or Italian Mafia. They were joined together under the banner of being against the government and authority.\n\nBefore the Russian Revolution and Communism in 1917, Russia was ruled by monarchs, kings that they called Tsars. Then came the Revolution. That perfect storm of revolution and war led to that explosion of 7m Mafias around Russia.\n\nThe government used gulags as both a state-building/economic tool and as a psychological tool. The goal was to use them economically.\n\nBecause there were so many prisoners, the guards needed help. They enlisted the most capable mafia members to keep them productive! This new generation of mafiosos would cement the collaboration between the government and the Russian Mafia.\n\nA new breed emerged to supplement the Soviet Economy: Black Market Entrepreneurs - Secret underground capitalist businessmen who smuggled goods into the country and sold them to make money. The Russian Mafia would offer protection to these business people.They created \u201cEnforcement Partnerships\u201d - where the Russian Mafia would offer business owners the protection the government failed to give them.\n\nRussia was in complete economic turmoil in every aspect during the 90\u2019s. They had the great stock market crash, hyperinflation, etc. So the government was in desperate need of money. They started selling the state\u2019s assets. Small businesses, big corporations, supplies, etc. And who was ready cash in hand to buy these assets? It was the corrupt politicians, insiders, black market entrepreneurs that would later be known as the Russian Oligarchs, and of course - the Russian Mafia. And \u201cin 1994, President Yeltsin declared that Russia was the \u2018biggest mafia state in the world\u2019\u201d\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
