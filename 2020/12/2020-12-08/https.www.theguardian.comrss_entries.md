## Jorginho salvages draw for lacklustre Chelsea against Krasnodar

<p>Timo Werner had only just entered the fray when he offered a glimpse of that devastating turn of pace. The volume in the stands rose as the Chelsea forward kept running, driving past a slightly baffled Krasnodar defence, and for a brief moment it seemed that a stunning winning goal was on the cards.</p><p>Yet Werner’s shot drifted past the far post and a moment of rare drama on an uneventful night was over. The temperature dipped again and Chelsea contented themselves with a draw, proud to head into the last 16 of the Champions League with an unbeaten record and as winners of Group E.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/08/chelsea-krasnodar-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ole Gunnar Solskjær had said beforehand that Manchester United were addicted to making life difficult for themselves. It had long been in their blood and his players appeared determined to prove their manager’s point during a torrid opening period against RB Leipzig. They slumped to an early 2-0 deficit and the damage could and should have been heavier.</p><p>The next part of the equation in recent times for Solskjær and the club has been outlandish fightbacks, particularly away from home. All hope looked lost when the Leipzig substitute Justin Kluivert made it 3-0 midway through the second half – a goal that had come against the run of play. United had advertised a goal of their own after the restart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/08/rb-leipzig-manchester-united-champions-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Surely, if there were a time to put the boot into the retail giant, it’s now. Instead, Channel 4 pulls its punches, with festive tips for navigating Jeff Bezos’s empire</p><p>Even the gentlest programme about Amazon cannot help but function as a reminder that Jeff Bezos originally planned to called his creation Relentless.com – presumably until a brave and/or heavily stock-optioned colleague took him aside and murmured in his ear: “You’re not supposed to say the quiet part out loud, Jeff.”</p><p>The Truth About Amazon: Can You Trust It This Christmas? (Channel 4) is indeed a gentle programme, the last in a series of three gentle programmes about the giganticest of retail giants. Presented by Helen Skelton and Sabrina Grant, this outcropping of Channel 4’s consumer rights franchise, Supershoppers, eschews anything like a full-blooded excoriation of Bezos or his behemoth. Like the original, supposedly one-off, documentary earlier this year, the series prefers to mix little more than a hint of hard truth with copious amounts of soft soap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/08/the-truth-about-amazon-review-slick-consumer-show-avoids-the-unpalatable-questions">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Charing Cross theatre, London</strong><br />Paul Harvard’s debut play, about homophobia and sexual assault, shows promise and has a complex lead but lacks focus</p><p>Exploring the life of a man trying to quit the London chemsex scene, Paul Harvard’s debut play demonstrates how buried trauma can shove its tentacles into every aspect of a life, poking and probing, knocking things out of place. GHBoy is a valiant attempt to understand the long process of healing after abuse, but this overpacked play lacks a necessary intensity.</p><p>The attention is on 35-year-old Robert (Jimmy Essex) – unsettled, indecisive, struggling to give up his hard-partying days – and his younger boyfriend Sergi (Marc Bosch) – innocent, jolly, thinking he’s found the love of his life.

<p>Russell Maliphant places movement front and centre of A Christmas Carol and dance is also boosting screen successes like Lovers Rock and Giri/Haji</p><p>Dance and cinema have a common source. The clue’s in the name: motion pictures. Movement is at the root of both art forms. That crossover is most obvious in early cinema, with its gestural acting style, its stunts and spectacles, in its long – now mostly long over – love affair with the musical. Nowadays, in western cinema at least, you’d be harder pushed to focus on movement in the movies. It’s there, of course, but most films press all their means – actors, scenes, music, movement – into the service of a different master: the narrative.</p><p>Jacqui and David Morris’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/04/a-christmas-carol-review-jacqui-david-morris">new A Christmas Carol movie</a>, then, comes as something of a shock: a feature film that puts dance front and centre, all the way through. A crazy idea! How does that work? The bottom line, I think, is that the directors make no pretence at narrative realism. It is nominally set inside a toy theatre, the film footage is often layered with paper cutouts and newsprint; Siân Phillips’ fireside voice narrates in the background, and every character is doubled by an on-screen dancer and a voice actor. Dance fits in by being as artful, as artificial as all the other means.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/08/a-christmas-carol-jacqui-david-morris-dance-cinema">Continue reading...</a>

I wasn’t making things up.” Later he felt anger, too, anger that the game he loves, and had given his life to, had, it seems, led to this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/08/alix-popham-interview-rugby-union-dementia-special-report">Continue reading...</a>

Matt Hancock, who is pretending to cry on TV by holding a single finger to a dry eye and then laughing – I don’t want to “gatekeep crying” but that is simply not how it is done – clearly isn’t all right. With Tuesday morning’s rollout making household names of Coventry grandmother Margaret Keenan (the first person to take the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine outside of trials) and William Shakespeare (the first person named William Shakespeare to take the vaccine out of trials), it’s totally understandable that this news would bring with it a small, squirming feeling of hope. But then Hancock dabs his bone-dry eyes again and says something like, “There’s so much work that’s gone into this and it really, really … I’m just proud to be British”, and: ah. Are you? Really?

## Pauline Baines obituary

<p>My cousin Pauline Baines, who has died aged 103, was an independent and multitalented woman. Contrary to the path envisaged by her family she built a successful career, working for nearly 25 years as a book designer and art director at Thames &amp; Hudson, her steady salary allowing her husband to pursue the more volatile path of an artist.</p><p>Pauline was born in Hove, East Sussex, to an observant Jewish family – her parents were Moses Behr, a chemist and businessman, and his wife, Sonia (nee Behr, a cousin). After they moved to north London, Pauline attended Brondesbury and Kilburn high school for girls, where she received a distinction in German. As the family were of limited means, and typically for the time, the education of her two brothers was prioritised over her desire to study languages at university. Pauline studied at Willesden Art School and the Central School of Art (now Central Saint Martins).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/08/pauline-baines-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## Jennifer Packer review – paintings that creep up on you

<p><strong>Serpentine Gallery, London</strong><br />Friendship, loss and the everyday populate Packer’s canvases, but they are full of disquieting detail</p><p>I’m drawn to the details in Jennifer Packer’s paintings. The woman whose legs are drawn up on to the chair, her red and white sneakers casually dangling. The pair of white stereo speakers on the floor nearby, with the tangle of white wires between them. The artist <a href="http://ericmack.com/">Eric Mack</a> (one of several frequent models), his ankles revealing odd socks, carefully chosen. A portable typewriter on poet <a href="https://www.aprilfreely.com/">April Freely</a>’s desk, with keys that look like rows of worn-down teeth (I think of a voice, clattering), a crocodile clip beside it, holding papers I can’t quite read. Freely sits, legs together, in a kind of yellowish haze. In another painting, the zipper of a leather jacket strewn on the sofa makes an arabesque of tiny white dots beside a pensive man whose downcast eyes stare at the floor or at something unseen. This incidental detail lightens the mood, gives you something else to look at beside the guy in the chair who evidently has things on his mind. His bulk and body language dwarf the chair, his stillness unnerving. Packer is very good at disquiet. Outwardly conventional – this is their disguise – the 36-year-old Black American’s oil-painted portraits, flower paintings and interiors creep up on you time and again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/08/jennifer-packer-the-eye-is-not-satisfied-with-seeing-review-serpentine-gallery-london">Continue reading...</a>

## Noël Coward's private lives: the photographs that could have landed him in jail

<p>A newly discovered album contains intimate, joyful glimpses of the playwright drinking, partying and holidaying with his famous friends and lovers. The result is an astonishing insight into gay life in the interwar years</p><p>In 1931, Noël Coward was the highest-earning author in the western world, celebrated for his scintillating comedies and sensational dramas of hidden love such as The Vortex, Private Lives and Easy Virtue. As well as writing hit songs, musicals, novels and short stories, he painted and, not least, performed. But perhaps the most astounding thing of all is the fact that – at a time when homosexuality was illegal and would remain so for some time – he lived an openly gay life.</p><p>It is this that makes a newly discovered photograph album so extraordinary. It shows intimate glimpses from the private life of this towering cultural figure. Apparently compiled in the 1930s by Coward’s closest female friend, Joyce Carey, the album is a remarkable insight into gay lives of the interwar years, lived in plain sight. Carey died in 1993. It is because of her long-held loyalty to the man she and other intimates only half-ironically called the Master that the album has only now come to light, due to be sold at a London sale room later this month.<br /><br />Many of the shots were taken at Goldenhurst, Coward’s country retreat in Kent, an extended redbrick farmhouse he bought in 1926. Here, and at more exotic sites, we see the artist and his famous friends at play. They bask in the ancient, faded sunlight, these people whose lives were bookended by two world wars. There’s Lord Mountbatten, fishing – Coward was later to play him in the wartime film In Which We Serve. And here’s Alec Guinness, in smart sunglasses, with his seraphic smile that gave little of his personal life away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/08/noel-cowards-private-lives-photographs-jail-friends-lovers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Analysis: there is a clear link between rugby and dementia, and the key event appears to be the leap to professionalism in the 1990s<br /></p><p>At the last count, in 2014, there were 1,339 people in the UK between the ages of 30 and 44 who had been diagnosed with dementia – or 0.01% of the 13 million in that age group, or one in every 9,500. The startling news that former professional rugby players from that demographic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/08/steve-thompson-former-rugby-union-players-dementia-landmark-legal-case">have been diagnosed with the condition</a> presents rugby with a reality it has dared not face until now.</p><p>Even if the 11 (eight of whom are joining a new legal action) turn out to be the only ones, which is next to inconceivable given we know of another 90 with likely symptoms – and this before those players had gone public, this before some have even reached middle age – they represent nearly 1% of the roughly 1,500 players from that age group who played professionally in England and Wales in the 15 years after rugby union went open. Assuming the incidence rate derived from the 2014 Dementia UK report has remained constant, the chances of that same wider population of 13m returning 10 or more cases from a sample of 1,500 are a shade under one in 10 trillion. For 11 or more, the chances are so small that a regular spreadsheet cannot cope and defaults to a probability of zero.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/08/rugby-union-dark-news-dementia-presents-sport-with-reality-dared-not-face">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest in a Guardian Print Shop <a href="https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture">series</a> featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free delivery</p><p>“England have done it in the last minute of extra time!” was John Motson’s euphoric commentary following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBuR-I4AT-o">the sensational, swivelling strike by David Platt that sent England into the quarter-finals of the 1990 World Cup</a> – commentary that later featured in Baddiel and Skinner’s song Three Lions (Football’s Coming Home). This joyful photograph by Mark Leech captures Paul Gascoigne, the man who delivered the free-kick to Platt, running to the substitutes’ bench in celebration. Emotional, cheeky and unpredictable, Gazza was a gift to photographers but a nightmare for his teammates – Chris Waddle later said he got about three hours’ sleep in the seven weeks they spent rooming together at Italia ’90. Of course, Gazza will always be best known for his tears in the semi-final against West Germany, but this image is an uplifting memory from that heartbreaking summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/08/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-gazzas-last-minute-joy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British-Zimbabwean comedian is one of the year’s breakout stars thanks to characters like posh drill rapper Unknown P, hilariously skewering hypocrisies around race and class</p><p>Any time there’s an incident that highlights the racism in British public life, Munya Chawawa will have skewered it while it’s still trending. The lightning-fast British-Zimbabwean sketch comedian has recently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CF-SB20gd5I/">lampooned PureGym’s 12 Years a Slave-themed workouts</a>, the white outrage at Sainsbury’s Black History Month initiatives and the complaints to ITV over Black Lives Matter protests on Britain’s Got Talent, within hours of them making headlines. His rapier satire has earned him half a million Instagram followers and a nomination at this week’s Mobo awards, and he landed a major label record deal for his character Unknown P, a posh drill rapper.</p><p>Young, Black, bold and political, the 27-year-old’s unwavering confidence and humour are being celebrated at a time when few Black people can speak about racism or critique the government without receiving swathes of abuse. He created the character of racist newsreader Barty Crease after attending a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest and seeing the media characterise it as violent. “There’s nothing funny about what happened to George Floyd, but there’s something very maliciously comical about how the press is treating this pain,” he says. Nevertheless, critics have said he straddles a fine line between confronting white viewers and trivialising racism.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/08/munya-chawawa-instagrams-finest-satirist-unknown-p">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With dating on hold, jobs lost and IVF postponed, many women fear their last chance to have a child may have disappeared. How are they coping?<br /></p><p>Saturday mornings are the worst. Claudia, a teacher, wakes up alone in bed in her London flatshare. The weekend stretches out before her, an interminable expanse to be filled as best she can – with walks, and TV, and more walks. Sometimes, she finds it hard to summon the motivation to get out of bed. “It sounds dramatic,” Claudia says, “but I’ll lie there, thinking: ‘What’s the point of getting up?’”</p><p>She goes over the arithmetic that has tortured her all year long. She will be 34 next month, single, no closer to finding a partner to have kids with. Even if she did meet someone next year, say, would they be ready to start conceiving within a year? Probably not. That could mean she will be 36 before she even starts trying – if she meets someone next year. And there’s the rub – because the Covid-19 restrictions have made dating nearly impossible. “My friends are either pregnant or looking after small children,” Claudia says, “and I struggle to even get men to talk to me online. It feels hopeless.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/08/it-feels-like-a-lost-year-the-women-who-fear-2020-has-stolen-their-chance-of-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>

Was another climate failure approaching, the latest botched attempt at solving the world’s global heating crisis?</p><p>Finally, as the mood in the hall was growing twitchy, the UN security guards cleared the platform and the top officials of the landmark Paris climate talks took to the podium.

The Paris agreement was approved at last.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/08/the-paris-agreement-five-years-on-is-it-strong-enough-to-avert-climate-catastrophe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The race is on to find a steady source of lithium, a key component in rechargeable electric car batteries. But while the EU focuses on emissions, the lithium gold rush threatens environmental damage on an industrial scale<br /></p><p>Even before the new mine became the main topic of village conversation, João Cassote, a 44-year-old livestock farmer, was thinking about making a change. Living off the land in his mountainous part of northern Portugal was a grind. Of his close childhood friends, he was the only one who hadn’t gone overseas in search of work. So, in 2017, when he heard of a British company prospecting for lithium in the region of Trás-os-Montes, Cassote called his bank and asked for a €200,000 loan. He bought a John Deere tractor, an earthmover and a portable water-storage tank.</p><p>The exploration team of the UK-based mining company Savannah Resources had spent months poring over geological maps and surveys of the hills that ripple out from Cassote’s farm. Initial calculations indicated that they <a href="http://www.savannahresources.com/assets/mina-do-barroso/" title="">could contain</a> more than 280,000 tonnes of lithium, a silver-white alkali metal – enough for 10 years’ production. Cassote got in touch with Savannah’s local office, and the mining firm duly contracted him to supply water to their test drilling site. The return on his investment was swift. After less than 12 months on the company’s books, Cassote had made what he would usually earn in five or six years on the farm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/08/the-curse-of-white-oil-electric-vehicles-dirty-secret-lithium">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Guardian investigative editor Paul Lewis and investigative reporter Rob Evans detail their decade-long investigation into undercover policing. At least 139 officers were given fake identities to monitor the inner workings of more than 1,000 political groups. Jessica, a former member of one of those groups, describes the impact of discovering that a man with whom she began a relationship in 1992 was actually an undercover cop </p><p>In 2010, Mark Stone, an environmental activist, was on holiday with his girlfriend when she discovered a passport for a man called Mark Kennedy in the glove box of their van. The man she was in a relationship with was actually a police officer who for seven years had lived deep undercover at the heart of the environmental protest movement. When the story became public, senior officers tried to quell the outcry, insisting that Kennedy was merely a rogue officer. In fact, the opposite was true. Kennedy <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/jan/10/mark-kennedy-undercover-cop-activist">was just one of many footsoldiers</a> who had been routinely infiltrating political groups, mostly on the left, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/15/undercover-police-spies-infiltrated-uk-leftwing-groups-for-decades">since as far back as 1968</a>.</p><p><strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>talks to the Guardian’s <strong>Paul Lewis </strong>and<strong> Rob Evans </strong>about their decade-long work with activists to investigate police spies. Officers’ deployments typically lasted four to five years, with them living alongside political campaigners, forming deep bonds of friendship, or having romantic liaisons with their targets. At least three of the police spies <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/07/met-police-pay-compensation-to-man-fathered-by-undercover-officer">fathered children with women</a> they met while undercover. The existence of a squad of officers sent deep undercover in political groups was so secret that many of the UK’s most senior police officers were oblivious until they began reading the reports in the Guardian 10 years ago. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/08/the-spy-cops-scandal-part-1">Continue reading...</a>
