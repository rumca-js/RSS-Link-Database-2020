<p>With new safety protocols prompting design changes, traditional office spaces may be a thing of the past</p><p>The pandemic has shown us that work can go on without a workplace. If it can be done online, it can be done from virtually anywhere with an internet connection. At the same time, however, the move to remote work has revealed the value of the workplace, as many employees hanker to return to the office.</p><p>In light of these two opposing trends, what might the office of the future actually look like?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-new-rules-of-work/2020/dec/01/no-touchscreens-more-space-welcome-to-the-post-pandemic-office">Continue reading...</a>

If you prefer your sport to come without too much tension, you’re in the right place: the series is already won and dusted. England’s white-ball know-how, freshly sharpened in the IPL, has proved too much for a South African side who have done well to get on the field at all given the shenanigans in their boardroom. </p><p>Today’s match, like the first, takes place in Cape Town, at the famous old ground now known as Six Gun Grill Newlands. If not exactly dignified, the name is apt in a way. England have brought six gun batsmen, as the players like to say, and each game so far has been decided by one of them – Jonny Bairstow with an explosive 86 not out off 48 balls, then Dawid Malan with a more measured 55 off 40. Today Eoin Morgan will be hoping the star turn is Jason Roy, who has scraped only 63 runs in eight international innings since lockdown. Even his strike rate has gone to pieces – it’s 74, rather than his usual 120-odd – though that will surely change if he can stick around long enough to get his eye in. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/dec/01/south-africa-v-england-third-mens-t20-international-live">Continue reading...</a>

There are so many scams and deepfakes floating in the feed. When you make a risque joke about period panties, Thinx replies.

They’re desperate to loop you into a post-relevant conversation about a forgotten brand from 2015.</p><p>These little micro-viral moments remind you that no one is in The Loop any more.

<p>Taste the treacle as Nicole Kidman’s Broadway liberals rebuke a rural high school – and learn a few things about themselves</p><p>Like High School Musical on some sort of absinthe/Xanax cocktail, The Prom is an outrageous work of steroidal show tune madness, directed by the dark master himself, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/26/ryan-murphy-american-horror-story-pose-politician-glee-nip-tuck">Ryan “Glee” Murphy</a>, who is to jazz-hands musical theatre what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/01/nancy-meyers-the-intern-interview-women-hollywood">Nancy Meyers</a> is to upscale romcom or Friedrich Nietzsche to classical philology.<br /><br />Meryl Streep and James Corden play Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman, two fading Broadway stars in trouble after their latest show closes ignominiously; it is called Eleanor!, a misjudged musical version of the life of Eleanor Roosevelt with Dee Dee in the title role and Barry as Franklin D Roosevelt. Barry also has financial difficulties (“I had to declare bankruptcy after my self-produced Notes on a Scandal”). After unhelpful press notices turn their opening night party at Sardi’s into a wake, Dee Dee and Barry find themselves drowning their sorrows with chorus-line trooper Angie (Nicole Kidman) and unemployed-actor-turned-bartender Trent (played by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jan/04/book-of-mormon-stone-parker">The Book of Mormon</a>’s Andrew Rannells). How on earth are they going to turn their careers around?</p><p>Then Angie sees a news story trending on Twitter: a gay teenager in Indiana has been prevented by her high school from bringing a girl as a date to the prom. The teen in question is Emma (a nice performance from Jo Ellen Pellman, like a young Elisabeth Moss), her secret girlfriend is Alyssa (Ariana DeBose) and it is Alyssa’s fiercely conservative mom (Kerry Washington) who is behind the ban. Our heroic foursome declare that they will sweep into hicksville with all their enlightened values and glamorous celebrity, and campaign against this homophobia, boosting their prestige in the biz. They gatecrash a tense school meeting, declaring dramatically: “We are liberals from Broadway!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/01/the-prom-review-ryan-murphy-nicole-kidman">Continue reading...</a>

Now that the first lady is getting ready to vacate the White House, however, it looks as if she may have found her voice. Rumour has it that Melania is planning to write a memoir about her time in public office. “She’s not done, or going as quietly as you might expect,” a mysterious source recently told the <a href="https://pagesix.com/2020/11/28/melania-trump-to-possibly-pen-memoir-on-time-spent-in-the-white-house/">New York Post</a>.</p><p>Well, of course she isn’t. Melania may not have the gift of the gab, but she is good at grabbing any opportunity for self-advancement that comes her way.

## The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone review – Coppola edits the past

<p>The director tweaks the little-loved final part of his Godfather trilogy as Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone tries to go into respectable business</p><p>Just when you thought you were out … he pulls you back in. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/francis-ford-coppola">Francis Ford Coppola</a> has presided over different editorial remixes of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/apocalypse-now">Apocalypse Now</a>, and now he’s done the same with his little-loved The Godfather Part III from 1990: with new edits and a new title. He and co-writer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/mario-puzo">Mario Puzo</a> have removed the “threequel” stigma by renaming it The Godfather Coda: The Death of Michael Corleone, but, at 158 minutes (compared with the 175 and 202 minutes of the other two films), it’s hardly short enough to be a coda and doesn’t function structurally as a coda in any way. Rightly or wrongly, it is exactly what the original title declared it to be: part three, the third act in the life of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), who in his 60s tries to go into respectable business by bailing out the Vatican’s financially embarrassed bank. He thereby becomes a businessman of enormous power, somewhere between Faustus and Mephistopheles, yet also a vulnerable target for shadowy conspirators.<br /><br />There are a number of little changes to the original film, the most important being one at the very end, which might baffle those wondering about that new title: The Death of Michael Corleone. This change could imply that his real death was the emotional or spiritual death that happened on the steps of the opera house in Palermo, or even much earlier than that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/01/the-godfather-coda-the-death-of-michael-corleone-review-francis-ford-coppola-al-pacino">Continue reading...</a>

But the EHRC, which found that officials failed to properly assess whether the set of harsh immigration policies drawn up in 2012 would be racially discriminatory, adds to the picture of a bureaucracy that either did not know or did not care that it was breaking the law.</p><p>As the EHRC’s report found, decisions in the Home Office were driven by a “narrow focus on delivering the political commitment of reducing immigration, and a culture where equality was not seen as important”.

<p>A gifted writer blessed with impeccable connections, he has nonetheless remained in the shadows, eclipsed by accidents and grander egos<br /></p><p>The Way to Santiago (1941) is a heady hybrid of spy thriller, murder mystery, gun-toting adventure and sleek noir, playing out against the dusty landscapes of South America in the immediate aftermath of the Spanish civil war and the start of the second world war. It follows the hapless agency writer, Englishman Jimmy Lamson, as he attempts to find the murderer of a fellow press man, hoping to find his own journalistic integrity along the way. The novel rattles through a kaleidoscopic array of Latin American vistas – sinister cantinas, crude railside shacks, glitzy palaces and dirt roads – all populated with characters you might find congregating on a Hollywood backlot: sad, red-lipped beauties, itchy-fingered assassins and clipped English gentlemen.</p><p>The novel was written by Oxford-educated author and Hollywood scriptwriter Arthur Calder-Marshall, based on his own time travelling through the region on a six-week break from his contract with MGM. It was then picked up by RKO’s new young star director, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/orsonwelles">Orson Welles</a>, who adapted the material for a film that was never made. And in a Hollywood-worthy twist, Mank – David Fincher’s new film about Welles and his fractious relationship with fellow screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz – stars Calder-Marshall’s grandson, Tom Burke, in the role of Welles. “I did know about the connection when I took on the role, but through Wikipedia, rather than my grandfather,” Burke says. “He never mentioned it to me and it wasn’t a story I grew up on.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/01/arthur-calder-marshall-the-way-to-santiago-orson-welles">Continue reading...</a>

So, lots of people think a fish or two might be the answer.</p><p>According to the retailer Pets at Home, there has been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/27/going-for-gold-pet-firm-reports-resurgence-in-fish-keeping">a resurgence of interest in fish-keeping</a>.

<p>Ipswich have lost five of their past eight League One games and alarm bells are ringing loudly in a season crucial to their future</p><p>Last month the Ipswich goalkeeping coach, Jimmy Walker, <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmywalker001/status/1327663889081831424">tweeted his views</a> on this season’s third tier. “Massive few weeks ahead,” he wrote. “League One is bonkers … and dare I say it … very average. If we don’t finish top four minimum we might as well wrap up.”</p><p>Using Walker’s logic, Ipswich may be returning Portman Road’s keys to the local council in May. They sit sixth, although several sides below them have games in hand, and have lost five of their past eight matches. The decline of the last decade, which culminated in relegation from the Championship in 2019, is close to spiralling into something far more serious. Ipswich feel like a ghost of a club: an institution that fell asleep on the job and has been outstripped by a long line of smarter, brighter rivals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/01/paul-lambert-battles-for-ipswich-future-at-a-ghost-club-in-rapid-decline">Continue reading...</a>

## Nigerian pop star Davido: 'Africans were made fun of. Now everyone wants us'

<p>The singer was taking a good-time sound to the world – but after his song Fem became the anthem of the EndSars protesters, he joined them on the streets</p><p>The buoyant, trumpeting chords of Fem, the opening track on Davido’s fourth album, A Better Time, suggest an artist who is vivacious, free of self-doubt, revelling in the limelight. David Adedeji Adeleke, 28, is part of a generation of Afrobeats artists who have blown the African dance-pop genre on to the global stage over the last decade; his songs have become the feelgood soundtrack of Nigeria’s nightlife, and made him one of his continent’s biggest pop stars.</p><p>Yet “Fem”, meaning “shut up” in pidgin, has taken on a different meaning. Last month, Lagos governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu pleaded with EndSars protesters, who had taken a stand against police brutality. The largest protest movement in Nigeria for decades had erupted, incensed at the abuses by the infamous and since disbanded Special Anti-Robbery Squad (Sars). As the protesters outside the government secretariat in Lagos grew impatient, a DJ at the demonstration suddenly played Fem, already a hit across the country. Scores began belting out his lyrics, drowning out the governor’s futile pleas. In a culture where reverence for authority figures can be brutally enforced, protesters recast the song into a defiant statement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/01/davido-nigerian-pop-star-fem-end-sars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For many, economising has been the painful result of job losses and furlough, while others are feeling guilty about splashing out in a pandemic. But will it last – and how will it affect the economy?</p><p>One of the many changes lockdown has wrought in me is that I’ve grown to dislike spending money. Previously, I was pretty free with it. I managed to keep my head above water, my account in the black, but not by much. I would happily buy takeaway coffees for £2.80, Pret lunches for close to a tenner, and £9 glasses of wine at wildly overpriced bars. Throw in train and tube fares and the occasional taxi, and a day at the office could easily cost £50 or more.</p><p>Come lockdown in March, all that changed. I was suddenly accumulating money rather than frittering it, and it was a nice feeling. But at some point in the past nine it started to become something bordering on an obsession: lockdown has turned me into a miser. Maybe I’m anxious about the rainy days ahead; maybe I’m worried about how fragile everything seems with the pandemic and Brexit and a government that is clearly out of its depth. But whatever the reason, I’ve become Scrooge-like.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/01/last-of-the-big-spenders-covid-new-frugality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I look strong, but I’m in constant pain. Navigating a world of sceptical looks and ‘oh, your back thing’ is frustrating and lonely</p><p>One morning when I was 15, I got out of bed, stood up, and noticed something wasn’t right. I had a stabbing pain in my back and down my leg. “That’s odd,” I remember thinking. “Probably nothing.” It turned out I had slipped a disc in my back. Back then, I didn’t really know what that meant, just that it was bloody painful. It stung, it ached and I could hear it in my head – it’s hard to describe quite what it was like. Within a year, I had three nerve root injections and an operation on my lumbar spine. But the pain remained.</p><p>Everything began to collapse around me. My grades plummeted and school became even more arduous than it had been before: all-boys state schools aren’t exactly brimming with compassion. I had two arms, two legs and I could walk down the corridors, therefore to others the problem didn’t exist. I started staying in bed, missing huge chunks of my education. I had 75% attendance in year 10 and 25% in year 11. I joked that at least when you added them up it made 100% – but they don’t give you extra marks for wit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/01/disabled-right-constant-pain-back">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The high-voltage style, comic-strip colours and eye-watering price tags of this Italian collective changed the world of design – what better place for an exhibition than modernist Milton Keynes?</p><p>With its comic-book colours, gaudy patterns and paper-thin veneers, the work of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2017/jul/21/memphis-group-ettore-sottsass-design-radical-met-breuer">Italian design group Memphis</a> has rarely looked as at home as it does in Milton Keynes. The first glimpse you get of the garish thrills in store in this new exhibition is through a big picture window, punched into the side of the corrugated mirror-polished box of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/mar/05/mk-gallery-review-milton-keynes">MK Gallery</a>.

The planners of this denigrated new town were plugged into the avant garde of contemporary design and radical urban theory in the 1970s. “They were reading Domus magazine in the development corporation,” he says. “I’ve always thought of the mirror-clad grid of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/may/03/struggle-for-the-soul-of-milton-keynes">Station Square</a> as a homage to <a href="https://www.archdaily.com/tag/superstudio">Superstudio</a> [a radical Italian architecture group].”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/01/genius-design-superstudio-memphis-plastic-field">Continue reading...</a>

But there is a quick and easy way to avoid much flooding: by restoring or creating flood plains.</p><p>These are usually flat low lands near rivers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/20/swamp-power-how-the-worlds-wetlands-can-help-stop-climate-change">natural wetlands</a> that often flood. But many flood plains have been drained for farmland or built over. Most flood plains are now in a perilous state – about two-thirds of them are severely degraded in England and up to 90% <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0341816218305058">have been adapted</a> across Europe. And so the flood waters often get funnelled into built-up areas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/01/weatherwatch-restoring-flood-plains-protect-climate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s 130 years since Father Christmas first appeared in a department store. But this year is the strangest one yet – with virtual calls taking the place of shopping centre visits. Is it enough to keep the ho ho hos flowing?</p><p>Five bearded men, dressed head to toe as Santa, wearing fur-trimmed face masks, file into an<strong> </strong>office building in London and sit behind wooden desks – laptops and webcams in front of them. The room has been made magical with the addition of a red and gold curtain, a snow-flecked Christmas tree and a stuffed penguin perched on top of some lockers. In years gone by these off-duty actors and former children’s TV presenters would have sat in department store grottos and worn out their knees taking the weight of Britain’s children. But they are here today to brush up their tech skills and learn how the in-store Santa can adapt and survive in the middle of a pandemic.</p><p>The seminar is led by James Lovell, a honey-voiced compere who straddles the line between practical teaching and keeping up the illusion of snow and elves. He leads the five Santas through exercises and practical advice on how to handle the intricacies of online video calls. The Santas pepper Lovell and a tech expert with questions about how they will see the children in their virtual grottos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/01/we-all-need-magic-in-our-lives-how-santas-grottos-moved-online-to-beat-the-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

## The mystery of the Gatwick drone

<p>A drone sighting caused the airport to close for two days in 2018, but despite a lengthy police investigation, no culprit was ever found. So what exactly did people see in the Sussex sky?</p><p>Soon after 9pm on Wednesday 19 December 2018, an airport security officer who had just finished his shift at Gatwick airport was standing at a bus stop on site, waiting to go home, when he saw something strange. He immediately called the Gatwick control centre and reported what he had seen: two drones. One was hovering above a vehicle inside the airport complex, and the other was flying alongside the nearby perimeter fence. The message was relayed to senior management. Unauthorised drone activity is considered a danger to aircraft and passengers because of the risk of collision. Within minutes, Gatwick’s only runway had been closed and all flights were suspended.</p><p>Over the next half hour, 20 police and airport security vehicles drove around the airport, lights flashing and sirens blaring, with the intention of scaring whoever was operating the drones. It didn’t work. By 9.30pm, six more sightings had been logged by the Gatwick control centre, five of them from police officers. Inside the airport, thousands of passengers waited to set off on their Christmas holidays. In the sky above, planes circled, waiting to land. Some were at the end of long journeys, and more than a dozen aircraft were soon dangerously low on fuel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/01/the-mystery-of-the-gatwick-drone">Continue reading...</a>
