That is where this new study comes to the rescue.\nIn this study - the cells of participants aged in reverse by the equivalent of a staggering 25 years with something much less invasive than blood transfusions\nMost generally accepted ways to slow down aging today only slows your body down by a tiny bit - so 25 years backwards is major\nThe method that they used to achieve these results isn\u2019t limited to the ultra wealthy\n\nTo understand how to cure aging, we first have to understand what causes aging.\nAging is one of those great mysteries in life that\u2019s up there with how consciousness works - so there\u2019s still much debate on what really causes aging\nThe ends of our chromosomes have what\u2019s called telomeres\nYou can think of telomeres like the plastic ends on your shoelaces that keep them from fraying\nAnd when your telomeres have been exhausted - that cell can\u2019t divide anymore and it turns into a senescent cell\nThese zombie cells contribute to things like diabetes, heart disease, and more\nThis is what researchers at the Tel Aviv University were about to change - to not just slow down the shortening of your telomeres, but to actually regenerate telomeres to make them longer\n\nHyperbaric Oxygen Chambers are basically where you lay inside a tube that\u2019s pressurized with 100% oxygen\n\nThey took 35 adults that were 64 or older and put them through 60 oxygen chamber sessions over the course of 3 months, at 5 sessions per week\n\nThanks to the oxygen chamber therapy, all the telomeres of these important cells grew by a significant amount, with some telomeres repairing nearly 40% of its length!\nThe same is true when researchers measured how many of those zombie senescent cells remained\n\nFor the first time, we\u2019ve discovered that you can age your blood cells - backwards by 25 years\n\nShould you do this yourself? It depends on how much money you have to throw around\nBut not all hope is lost if you\u2019re not rolling in cash\nAs this technology gets more attention, as more people are interested in doing this kind of therapy, as the economies of scale go up - prices will go down\n\nThe dream of immortality is a far off one\nBut this is a step in the right direction\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
