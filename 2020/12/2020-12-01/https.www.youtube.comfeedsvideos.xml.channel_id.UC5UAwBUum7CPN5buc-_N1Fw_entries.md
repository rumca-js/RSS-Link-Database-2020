Linus Torvalds has expressed interest in the latest Apple M1 Macs, which, for those who don't know, are custom designed processors that will only be appearing in Apple's macs, and that are pretty freaking amazing in terms of performance and battery life.

AMD released their radeon RX6800 and 6800XT graphics cards. While these seem very powerful, tickling Nvida on their higher end models, the launch day situation is far from optimal on Linux.

There was an interesting article published after the announcement of the PinePhone KDE Community edition, which points out to critics that the phone might be weaker than what people are used to, and that it's not a flagship, but that it's also not the point.

Long time viewers will know I'm not a big fan of Google, or of Blink, their web rendering engine, but it seems like Google is taking steps to please me. Well, probably not that, but at least they're opening up Chromium and Blink to more outside developers.

Lutris 0.5.8 was released, and despite the small version number, it's a huge improvement. This game manager is now better integrated with the lutris website that lets you download game installers, and games from 3rd party services no lmonger depend on a lutris install script, which means you can just install them as-is, even if they don't have one.
