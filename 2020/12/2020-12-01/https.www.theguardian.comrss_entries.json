If you prefer your sport to come without too much tension, you\u2019re in the right place: the series is already won and dusted.

If not exactly dignified, the name is apt in a way. England have brought six gun batsmen, as the players like to say, and each game so far has been decided by one of them \u2013 Jonny Bairstow with an explosive 86 not out off 48 balls, then Dawid Malan with a more measured 55 off 40. Today Eoin Morgan will be hoping the star turn is Jason Roy, who has scraped only 63 runs in eight international innings since lockdown. Even his strike rate has gone to pieces \u2013 it\u2019s 74, rather than his usual 120-odd \u2013 though that will surely change if he can stick around long enough to get his eye in. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/dec/01/south-africa-v-england-third-mens-t20-international-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/dec/01/south-africa-v-england-third-mens-t20-international-live", "date_published": "2020-12-01 15:12:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Afghans outraged at image of Australian soldier drinking from prosthetic leg", "description": "<p>Limb thought to come from dead Taliban fighter as case adds to disgust over recent report detailing ADF abuse</p><p>Afghan civil society leaders have reacted with disgust to photographs of an Australian special forces soldier <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/dec/01/photo-reveals-australian-soldier-drinking-dead-taliban-prosthetic-leg\">drinking alcohol from the prosthetic leg</a> of a slain Taliban fighter.</p><p>Images published by the Guardian on Tuesday showed a senior soldier who is still enlisted in the Australian Defence Force drinking beer from the leg in an unofficial bar on a base in Tarin Kowt, the capital of Uruzgan province, in 2009.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/01/afghans-outraged-at-image-of-australian-soldier-drinking-from-prosthetic-leg\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/01/afghans-outraged-at-image-of-australian-soldier-drinking-from-prosthetic-leg", "date_published": "2020-12-01 15:08:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Number of people rejecting Queen's honours doubles in past decade", "description": "<p>Exclusive: Hundreds reject knighthoods and MBEs as unease around empire and favours grows</p><p>The proportion of people turning down honours from the Queen is rising and has more than doubled over the past nine years, a Guardian analysis shows.</p><p>Nearly 450 people rejected a knighthood, MBE, OBE or other awards in recognition of their merit, service or bravery from 2011 to this year, according to Cabinet Office figures released under a freedom of information (FoI) request.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/01/number-of-people-rejecting-queens-honours-doubles-in-past-decade\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/01/number-of-people-rejecting-queens-honours-doubles-in-past-decade", "date_published": "2020-12-01 15:06:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Car ploughs into crowd of pedestrians in German city of Trier", "description": "<p>Driver was arrested in incident that left at least two dead, but police would not comment on a motive</p><p>At least two people were killed and 15 injured when a car ploughed into a crowd of people in the historic centre of the city of Trier in south-west Germany on Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>According to the local newspaper Trierischer Volksfreund, the incident occurred when a grey SUV sped down Fleischstrasse, a straight pedestrianised street with shops and cafes that leads to Hauptmarkt, the city\u2019s medieval market square.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/01/car-ploughs-into-crowd-of-pedestrians-in-german-city-of-trier\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/01/car-ploughs-into-crowd-of-pedestrians-in-german-city-of-trier", "date_published": "2020-12-01 15:02:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Britain\u2019s least used railway station served just 42 passengers in 2019", "description": "<p>Berney Arms in Norfolk is a request stop on a line from Norwich to Great Yarmouth</p><p>Britain\u2019s least used railway station has been revealed as Berney Arms in Norfolk, which served just 42 passengers last year.</p><p>The station, a request stop consisting of one short platform, a name plate and a tiny wooden shelter, is 30 minutes along a single-track line from Norwich to Great Yarmouth, and named after a local pub that closed several years ago.
