Jade Bird recently performed a virtual session and was interviewed by Jill Riley. In 2020, Jade Bird relocated to Austin, Texas, and she's been releasing new music; notably, "Headstart," which you've been hearing on The Current. Two-and-a-half years ago, Jade Bird performed a solo acoustic MicroShow for a small gathering of lucky attendees in a salon at the James J. Hill House — sometimes called "Minnesota's Downton Abbey" — on Summit Avenue in St. Paul. Here are three songs from that unforgettable performance.

Thank you to New Belgium Brewing for its support of The Current's MicroShow series.
