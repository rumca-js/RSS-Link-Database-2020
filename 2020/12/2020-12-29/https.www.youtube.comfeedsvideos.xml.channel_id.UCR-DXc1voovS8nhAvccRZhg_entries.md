The Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO Board exposes an x1 PCI Express Gen 2.0 slot.

What can you do with the slot? And are there any tips or tricks to make sure you don't accidentally cook a PCIe cardâ€”or the Pi?

The CM4 goes beyond 1 Gigabit with WiFi 6. But can it do 2.5 Gbps Ethernet?

I'll explore that question using the Rosewill RC20001 PCIe card, and test how fast it can go on my new baby 10 Gbps home network!
