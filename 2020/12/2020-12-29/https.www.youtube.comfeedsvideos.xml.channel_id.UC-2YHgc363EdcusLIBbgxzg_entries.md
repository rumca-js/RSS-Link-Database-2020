Actually the dogs are a lot of fun but they also interrupt a LOT of videos. And Zoe is a giant diva to work with (in fairness, she does have her own cult). Anyway, here are some standout moments.

I screw up. A lot. Here's a short collection of bloopers from the last couple of years on the channel. (Yes, some of these dip into 2019. Whatever just enjoy them.) 

Thanks for a great year!
