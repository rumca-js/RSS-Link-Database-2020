Glasgow-based CHVRCHES formed in 2011 and first performed in The Current studio in 2013, shortly after making a splash at that year's SXSW music conference in Austin, Texas. Since then, CHVRCHES have visited The Current a couple more times, and in 2018, the band allowed The Current to provide a live video stream of their show at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minn., when CHVRCHES were in the midst of the tour in support of their third album, "Love Is Dead." We'll feature live recordings by CHVRCHES during the upcoming On-Air Fest, happening Dec. 12 and 13. Here are three live recordings done by CHVRCHES at The Current through the years.
