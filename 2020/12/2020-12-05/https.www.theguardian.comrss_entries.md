<ul><li>Mercedes pair lock out front row in Hamilton’s absence</li><li>Russell denied pole by 0.026sec on debut for team</li></ul><p>Pole position belonged to Valtteri Bottas for the Sakhir Grand Prix but it was his teammate, George Russell, whose talent shone under floodlights in Bahrain. The 22-year-old Briton – standing in for a self-isolating Lewis Hamilton – put his Mercedes on the front row, denied pole by the slenderest of margins on his very first drive in a competitive car. In so doing Russell laid down a marker that he should be considered as heir apparent to the seven-times world champion at Mercedes.</p><p>Bottas took pole on his final lap in Q3 with a time of 53.377sec. Russell pushed him to the limit, sweeping home just two-hundredths of a second behind. Max Verstappen’s Red Bull was in third.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/05/valtteri-bottas-pips-george-russell-sakhir-f1-gp-pole">Continue reading...</a>

I am about to discuss whodunnit, so if you are behind, please don’t read on.

<p>Celebrations will be diminished for everyone by Covid this year: we need to focus on the things we’d love. Like lobster for two</p><p>Who are you going to bubble with? Which households will you choose? At Christmas, I mean. It’s so difficult. I don’t know about you, but if my parents, siblings, nieces, nephews and assorted in-laws all went out for a walk en masse, it would probably be possible to see us from outer space. Like many modern families – which is to say, most normal families – this isn’t only a matter of generational expansion. No, it’s much more complex than that. As I like to tell people I’ve only just met, I have two <em>extant</em> stepmothers – which is naughty of me, because there are no dead ones. To my knowledge.</p><p>The point of this column isn’t family life, and how to survive it. The point is to consider <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/24/the-five-day-christmas-covid-bubble-how-will-it-work">what Christmas will be like this year</a>, and how to survive that. My hunch is that whatever the rules, for all of us it will be sadly diminished: fewer people, less travelling, no parties. And while this might not be ideal, I also want to say that if there’s one thing life has taught me, it’s that it’s not as hard as you might imagine to ensure that small is beautiful. It definitely wasn’t much fun when the various sadists for whom I worked in my 20s used to insist for no good reason at all that I had to be in the office on Boxing Day (an edict that made it impossible for me to travel north). Even then, though, I was adept at the bijou ceremonies that can see a person through a gloomy day. If I was going to eat a leftover egg roll for my Christmas lunch, then I would at least wash it down with something fizzy (and I don’t mean Sprite). Looking back, some of the most delicious things I’ve ever eaten at Christmas – a coronation chicken sandwich at an almost empty airport; a slice of my mother’s marzipaned cake taken from a tin at the end of a long shift – were scoffed in the loneliest of circumstances, the fun going on elsewhere, the warmth and the light flickering only in my mind’s eye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/05/christmas-in-the-time-of-coronavirus-how-to-survive-and-thrive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A midcentury house on a wooded hill has been stripped back to its origins to provide both inspiration and a relaxing home</p><p>Arriving at Curtis Holder’s south London home, I am invited to view what the portraitist smilingly calls his “smoking room”. Neither fuggy nor fusty, Holder’s version of a Victorian gentleman’s hideaway is, in fact, his studio. Holder, who’s currently appearing on the Sky Arts feelgood <em><a href="https://www.sky.com/watch/title/series/3e1cfda1-28a9-42f2-be75-220b7e8863ca/portrait-artist-of-the-year" title="">Portrait Artist of the Year</a></em> show, designed the welcoming space himself, adding sleek, wood-panelled storage to echo the midcentury feel of his live-work 1960s townhouse where, as he puts it, “Everything has its place.”</p><p>There was little left of its original architecture when Holder, and his partner, Steve Goggin, a digital content manager for the Historic Royal Palaces, moved here 15 years ago. “At that point we didn’t have a tube station and the area was still affordable,” he says. The cul-de-sac property is set in an estate of modernist properties bordered by quiet woodland. “I used to live nearby, and I’ve always loved this road. I called it San Francisco Way because it’s so wide and the houses are so unusual.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/05/artist-in-residence-the-london-home-and-backdrop-of-a-portraitist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A recent study suggests lengthy, complex corporate filings are increasingly read by, and written for, machines</p><p>My eye was caught by the title of a working paper published by the National Bureau for Economic Research (NBER): <a href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w27950">How to Talk When a Machine Is Listening: Corporate Disclosure in the Age of AI.</a> So I clicked and downloaded, as one does. And then started to read.</p><p>The paper is an analysis of the 10-K and 10-Q filings that American public companies are obliged to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The 10-K is a version of a company’s annual report, but without the glossy photos and PR hype: a corporate nerd’s delight. It has, says <a href="https://www.thebalance.com/annual-reports-10k-10q-357266">one guide</a>, “the-everything-and-the-kitchen-sink data you can spend hours going through – everything from the geographic source of revenue to the maturity schedule of bonds the company has issued”. Some investors and commentators (yours truly included) find the 10-K impenetrable, but for those who possess the requisite stamina (big companies can have 10-Ks that run to several hundred pages), that’s the kind of thing they like. The 10-Q filing is the 10-K’s quarterly little brother.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/05/companies-are-now-writing-reports-tailored-for-ai-readers-and-it-should-worry-us">Continue reading...</a>

Often when a film has been released I’ll ask: “Did I make mistakes?” When I made <em>The Cotton Club</em> in 1984, people were telling me there were too many black people in it and too much tap dancing. I would say: “But it’s a movie about black people tap dancing.” Years later, I realised I had taken out half of the backstory. It was good to go back and fix that.</p><p><strong>Life is a great</strong> screenwriter. My daughter, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/sofia-coppola" title="">Sofia</a>, got such awful, unjust criticism for her performance in <em>The Godfather Part III</em>.

Now she is a more famous movie director than me.

<p>The duo at the heart of this Liverpool band make their presence felt with an EP of slow-burning delights</p><p>Lessons in how to set tables don’t often feature in bands’ creation myths, but that was the catalyst that brought the core members of Liverpool’s <a href="https://cityslang.com/artists/king-hannah">King Hannah</a> together. Guitarist Craig Whittle had first seen Hannah Merrick singing at a college band showcase. “I remember Hannah playing a song solo, just guitar and vocals, and I was blown away,” he told <em><a href="https://whenthehornblows.com/content/2020/11/17/band-of-the-week-king-hannah">When the Horn Blows</a></em>. But it wasn’t until several years later, when they were co-workers in a bar and she was instructing him in how to lay out cutlery, that he was finally able to persuade her to write songs with him.</p><p>It’s a good thing he did: their recently released debut EP, <em><a href="https://cityslang.com/releases/king-hannah-tell-me-your-mind-and-ill-tell-you-mine">Tell Me Your Mind And I’ll Tell You Mine</a></em>, is a slow-burning delight, Merrick’s smoky, hypnotic voice pitched somewhere between Hope Sandoval and Lana Del Rey, while Whittle provides the languorous, Kurt Vile-like guitar lines, most spectacularly on the Sharon Van Etten-endorsed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnj8MOFsRWM">Crème Brûlée</a>. But while there’s an Americana feel to the music, Merrick’s lyrics stay closer to home: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2e9w-XlhdcU">Meal Deal</a> is about the difficulty of flat-hunting for the precariat. This reportage approach to writing is deliberate. “We don’t want to sound clean or polished,” says Whittle. “We want to sound real, and dynamic and authentic.” </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/05/one-to-watch-king-hannah-craig-whittle-hannah-merrick-tell-me-your-mind">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author reflects on the sense of alienation that informed his first novel, and the book’s lasting message of moral responsibility</p><p>In 1993, I emigrated from a big, thriving, multicultural city in Australia to a failing farm in the tranquil isolation of the Scottish Highlands. The culture shock made me feel as if I’d landed on another planet. Many aspects of British society struck me as unnecessarily depressing – but then I was depressed anyway. My natural alienation worsened and I became very unwell. I had a job in a care home but it was a 15 mile bicycle ride from the farm, and in harsh weather I would chicken out and catch taxis to and from work, which ate up my meagre wages. Eventually my wife suggested I concentrate on my writing instead.</p><p>I’d been toying with the idea of a novel about a childless couple who abduct a baby monkey, shave its fur off, pay for it to be surgically modified to resemble a human, and then introduce it into society as their child. I wanted it to be a thought-provoking tale about difference and the extent to which our culture is willing to accommodate or even tolerate it. But the more I mulled on it, the clearer it became that the novel would be a satire. I didn’t want to write a satire. I wanted to write a book that knocked people sideways, haunted them for ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/05/michel-faber-under-the-skin-changed-my-life-for-good">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Want to give a little love with a handmade present, but don’t know where to start?

Yet when 27-year-old Benito Skinner, AKA Benny Drama, finally appears on screen from his new home in LA, he is momentarily flummoxed by his own backdrop, a fuchsia pink whirlpool of lipsticks. He scrambles around trying to change it, briefly flashing up a still of one of his monstrous new creations, Kooper, the work-phobic, lipgloss-obsessed intern whose dad happens to own the company, before finally finding the off button and settling on the standard Zoom interview angle. “That’s better,” he smiles. “Up my nose vibes.”</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips">The Guide: Staying In – sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/dec/05/benito-skinner-comedy-viral--benny-drama-grimes-kardashians">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether you’ve lost your job or fallen out of love with it, many people turned to something new this year. We meet those who did – plus a beginner’s guide to taking the plunge</p><p>For 21 years, Ian Garrett worked in the oil industry. He started his career at BP, then made his way up through the ranks, eventually becoming the chief well engineer for Tullow Oil. He worked long days; his job required a lot of travel, and took him from the North Sea to places such as Angola, Ghana and Algeria. But, at the age of 43, he has just finalised his application to become a schoolteacher. “Assuming that’s successful, I’ll start the PGCE in secondary school maths teaching next September, graduate from that by the following summer, and I’ll be teaching full-time in September 2022.”</p><p>Garrett was made redundant from the oil company at the start of the first lockdown. He planned to use his redundancy package to take the summer off, and start looking for work later in the year. But when he and his wife ended up home schooling their two children, aged six and eight, he became one of the few parents to enjoy the experience. “I loved it, actually,” he says. “I found it really rewarding.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/dec/05/people-are-craving-something-more-is-it-time-to-embrace-your-career-plan-b">Continue reading...</a>
