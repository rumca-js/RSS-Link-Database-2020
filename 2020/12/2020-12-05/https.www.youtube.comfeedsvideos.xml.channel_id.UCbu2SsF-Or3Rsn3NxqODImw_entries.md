It’s safe to say that Immortals Fenyx Rising has taken inspiration from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but how exactly do the two games compare? 

Immortals Fenyx Rising is Ubisoft’s latest open-world adventure, and despite being an original IP takes a fair few cues from a variety of games - most notably The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but also Ubisoft’s own Assassin’s Creed franchise.

In the video above, Kurt Indovina and Max Blumenthal compare Immortals with Breath of the Wild across three topics: exploration, combat, and puzzles. From an exploration standpoint, Immortals offers a very Ubisoft take on the Breath of the Wild formula, with a healthy dose of inspiration from recent Assassin’s Creed titles.

Kurt and Max also break down the two game’s combat, and discuss which title has the more satisfying fighting systems in play. And finally, they discuss Immortals and Zelda’s compelling puzzles - or Vaults vs. Shrines - to see which game has the upper hand when it comes to testing our brains.

Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the iconic weaponry of Call of Duty: WW2, including the M1 Garand - complete with its iconic ‘ping’ sound, the Russian PPSh-41 submachine gun, and the German STG44 Assault Rifle.

Call of Duty: WW2 saw the COD franchise return to the Second World War with a ‘boots on the ground’ shooter experience, which was full to the brim with period WW2 guns like the American Thompson M1A1, the German MP40, and the Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol.

In the above video, Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weapons of Call of Duty: WW2, and compares their in-game depictions against their real-world counterparts.

This week on Generation Next, the gang discuss the rise of unscrupulous scalpers who are profiting from PS5 and Series X demand to make hundreds. 

If you weren't lucky enough to secure a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S at launch, you may be going through the frustrating experience of watching for restocks and hoping you're quick enough to bag a console. What makes this process so aggravating, however, is the presence of bots--and groups that use them--that snap up all the stock in seconds and then sell them for a premium price.

We are, of course, talking about scalpers. For those familiar with the wild world of sneaker/trainer resale, you'll be intimately familiar with the difficulties of snagging a limited edition or exclusive pair before an algorithm powered bot eats up the stock. This year, however, these bots, and clandestine groups that utilize them, began to target a wider variety of highly sought after items. Most notably, Nvidia's 30 series of graphics cards have been close to impossible for the average person to buy. Naturally, Sony and Microsoft's new consoles have also become targets, with some groups snatching thousands of consoles for themselves.

On this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor break down what's going on with scalpers and the retail bots, as well as look at whether any of it is actually illegal, what can be done, and also their own experiences with scalping or selling hot ticket items at a premium.
