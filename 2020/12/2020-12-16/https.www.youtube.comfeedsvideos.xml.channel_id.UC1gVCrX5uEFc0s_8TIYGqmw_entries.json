Scenes include various characters (people in animal masks) parading, floats, bands playing, and general parade views.\n\nOn Thanksgiving morning in 1924, Macy\u2019s department store in New York City held a parade to drum up business and publicity. The theme was Christmas (and shopping for gifts).\n\nStore employees dressed in outrageous costumes and walked six miles from Harlem down to the Macy\u2019s flagship store in Herald Square, accompanied by festive floats and animals from the Central Park Zoo.\n\nThe first parade ended with Santa Claus ascending to a golden throne above the store\u2019s entrance and inviting thousands of customers to come and shop.\n\nThe parade was such a success that it became an annual tradition.\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Mashable:\nhttps://mashable.com/2015/11/08/macys-thanksgiving-parade/\n\nOriginal video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality.
