## Sam Allardyce is back in the top flight but will old truths still apply? | Jonathan Liew

<p>Can the Premier League’s survival specialist, out of work since 2018, get the job done at his eighth club, West Brom?</p><p>There’s a knock on the sunbed. The lid swings ominously open, filling the room with an eerie blue ultraviolet glow. A 66-year-old man of medium to heavy build climbs out, accepts the bathrobe that is wordlessly proffered to him. There is a car out front with its engine running. A freshly-pressed suit and referee’s whistle hanging in the back. Destination: the West Midlands, and the Monster HydroSport Training Ground. And with that, Sam Allardyce returns.</p><p>Was this how it happened? On reflection, probably not. But then this has always been the thing about Allardyce, who has been summoned from the managerial antechamber by West Bromwich Albion after two years out of the game: the mythology performs as crucial a function as the man himself. When you hire Allardyce, what you’re paying for is not so much a coach or an employee, but a brand, a creed, a lifestyle. You’re buying wholesale into <em>allardycismo</em> as an idea. You’re painting your world, or your little corner of it, a vivid shade of Big Sam.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/16/sam-allardyce-appointed-west-bromwich-albion-premier-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister’s obvious dislike of prescriptive social regulations dilutes his authority when asking people to comply</p><p>There is a fine line between optimism and complacency that Boris Johnson has often crossed during the coronavirus pandemic. In July, when lifting the first national lockdown, the prime minister held out the prospect of “a significant return to normality” in time for Christmas. He <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/nov/05/boris-johnson-as-normal-a-christmas-as-possible-if-people-follow-lockdown-rules-video" title="">restated that ambition in November</a>, when setting out the terms of a second lockdown. “I have no doubt that people will be able to have as normal a Christmas as possible,” he said.</p><p>What marks that forecast as typically Johnsonian is the gratuitous certainty. The prime minister believes that asserting something with confidence makes it more likely to become true. That method can be effective as campaign rhetoric, but in government it risks making an enemy of reality.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/16/the-guardian-view-on-johnson-and-covid-rules-a-habit-of-complacency">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We will never find satisfactory proof that things are going to turn out all right, writes advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong>. The trick is to look for something else</p><p><strong>I’ve been an optimist my whole life, with a rugged dedication that even I can see is, at times, questionable. My optimism mainly rests on a belief in the inherent goodness of people and, in many ways, I haven’t been disappointed. But over the last few years I had to face the fact that most of my significant relationships have been abusive and, clearly, there’s a tonne of evidence of hatred, ruthless greed and intolerance everywhere at the moment.</strong></p><p><strong>These experiences have provoked something of an existential crisis in me. I still feel an optimistic outlook is, fundamentally, the only way to keep going – otherwise what’s the point?

<p>Boris Johnson remains deeply flawed, but there are signs that his style of leadership is becoming less top-down </p><p>What follows is all extremely relative, all highly conditional, and there is no guarantee that any of it will be sustained in the future, even if it is correct in the first place. But here’s the thing to note: as we near the close of what one Conservative MP rightly called “<a href="https://www.staffordshire-live.co.uk/news/mp-delighted-christmas-covid-rules-4804343">a torrid year</a>” for the country in the Commons today, Boris Johnson is moving towards a style of government that will be to his party’s advantage and, in some ways, to that of the country too.</p><p>That’s because there are signs – only signs, but a number of them all the same – that a somewhat less confrontational form of UK governance is beginning to take shape. Where it may lead, if and when life begins to return to some sort of normality in 2021, is tricky to predict. But if this very tentative reading of the government is even half right, the consequences may be influential for Johnson, for his party and within British politics into 2021 and beyond.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/16/post-cummings-more-consensual-government-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the first time, there will be more focus on Tiger Woods’s partner than Tiger Woods. And his partner is only 11 years old</p><p>Sawgrass, 17 March 2019. The latest snapshot of lives less ordinary arrived in an eight-word answer from Tiger Woods. “I don’t let them go on social media,” said Woods in respect of his children, Sam and Charlie, when whether or not they may have witnessed an amusing mid-round incident at the Players Championship was contemplated.</p><p>Keeping those aged 11 and 10, as was the case last spring, away from the all-consuming world of Facebook, Instagram and Twitter may seem sensible. There is a broader dynamic in this specific case: Woods’s global stardom status is one thing, the abuse that can still be thrown his – or his family’s – way on account of an infamous infidelity scandal quite another. For every strand of adulation towards Tiger Woods the golfer, there is a barb about cocktail waitresses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/16/team-woods-tiger-son-charlie-pnc-championship-golf">Continue reading...</a>

This festive plait achieves a soft crumb from the yudane technique, where boiling water gelatinises the starches in the flour, before being included into the dough. This allows the starches to absorb more liquid and provides a tender and fluffy texture without the need for butter or eggs. </p><p>Be careful as some spices can affect the yeast, and often longer proving times are needed (cinnamon is particularly tricky). The prunes and dates bring sweetness and richness with all the added benefits of vitamins and fibre. My big tip is to buy a jar of malt extract. It gives an earthy depth to so many bakes and here provides a really shiny glaze.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/16/david-athertons-recipe-for-festive-plait">Continue reading...</a>

Ashenden and Owen play both duos, vying for stage space and the attention of a Hollywood big shot in the crowd, in what evolves into a quickfire, costume-changing, chase-around-the-curtain caper. The DIY overambition that was part of its charm in Edinburgh has had to be sacrificed. In its place, there’s more heart – though worn a bit too prominently on its sleeve towards the end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/16/the-comeback-review-noel-coward-theatre-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Christmas party food steps up a gear with these meat-free but not flavour-free crowd-pleasers</p><p>Though a sausage roll is certainly not just for Christmas, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/dec/02/how-make-perfect-sausage-rolls">is it really a Christmas party without them</a>? Frankly, I’m not sure it is, unless you’re vegetarian, in which case you’re often expected to celebrate with fridge-cold hummus or fight over a brie and cranberry tartlet instead. These particular sausage rolls, however, are a true crowd-pleaser: meat-free, but not flavour-free. As an enthusiastic consumer of the classic variety, I can hand on heart assure you that they more than live up to expectations.</p><p>All traditional sausage rolls, whether they’re billed as <a href="http://www.sambilton.com/christmas-pudding-stuffing/">Christmas pudding</a> or<a href="https://www.prima.co.uk/all-recipes/baking/a30169045/nadia-sawalha-sausage-roll-cheese/"> </a>“<a href="https://www.prima.co.uk/all-recipes/baking/a30169045/nadia-sawalha-sausage-roll-cheese/">blistering hot</a>”, have meat as their base.

<p>This magical service has been at the heart of Christmas for several generations of my family. But my conscience will no longer let me take part</p><p>Growing up, my family was what I would now describe as culturally Church of England. Ours was the scenic, zero-commitment kind of Christianity. We grew up thinking of it as utterly default, in a way I don’t think kids would any more, even in deepest Kent. My siblings and I were christened and went to CofE village schools. We learned about other religious holidays but never saw evidence of them. We were not <em>religious</em> – no one was. By which I mean, we only went to church at Christmas.</p><p>Specifically, we would go to Christingle, the magical service that is aimed at, and makes no sense whatsoever to, children. It happened at some enchanted hour that felt like the dead of night (I was dumbfounded to learn much later that it actually kicked off at three in the afternoon). There were a few hymns, as familiar as lullabies, and there were talky bits, during which shepherds and “wise men” would time travel around the nave, or something.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/16/i-used-to-love-christingle-until-i-discovered-what-my-church-thought-of-trans-people">Continue reading...</a>

It was with my mother that I first watched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/upstairs-downstairs">Upstairs, Downstairs</a> — I was 10 at the time – and, through it, got an early glimpse of the house party, a phenomenon the sheer Britishness of which enraptured me.</p><p>In the sunny and freewheeling Palo Alto of the 1970s and 80s, I read about cold manor houses in which each of the 18 bedrooms had a different hand-blocked wallpaper.

This week’s picture is of Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish who spurred the Reds to eight league titles during his time as a player and manager</p><p>The 1985-86 season was Kenny Dalglish’s first term as player-manager of Liverpool and although he only netted three times that campaign, this strike was particularly precious. It came in the final match of the season, away at Chelsea, as the Reds secured a 1-0 victory to win the league title at Everton’s expense. Dalglish controlled a looping through-ball on his chest and laced a sweet right-foot volley into the far corner – “an unerring finish” in the words of commentator John Motson – before wheeling away in celebration. Dalglish inspired ongoing success, primarily from the dugout, and by his final appearance in 1990 he had netted 169 times in 502 appearances for Liverpool. No wonder they call him ‘King Kenny’.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/16/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-dalglish-seals-the-title">Continue reading...</a>

## How we think about trauma is vital to how we move on from it | James Greig

<p>The world has wised up to how our past affects our present. But I know that labelling ourselves as ‘traumatised’ holds us back</p><p>Trauma as a medical phenomenon has its roots in the late 19th century, when it was known as “railway spine”, a condition suffered by survivors of railway accidents (a new phenomenon at the time) and believed to be caused by microscopic lesions in the body. It arose in tandem with the insurance industry; people seeking compensation needed evidence to back up their claims, particularly if they hadn’t been visibly injured. During the first world war, it was recognised but afforded little sympathy: traumatised soldiers were seen as unpatriotic, cowardly and lazy.</p><p>It wasn’t until the 1970s that the term “post-traumatic stress disorder” came into use. But to begin with, the diagnosis was limited to <a href="https://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/publications/agent-orange/agent-orange-summer-2015/nvvls.asp">military veterans</a>. Eventually, the concept of trauma was expanded to include survivors of sexual violence, familial abuse and other catastrophes – a positive development. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/16/think-about-trauma-vital-move-labelling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ‘Everyone In’ scheme housed 15,000 street homeless people during the first Covid wave. As winter hits, charities say it must be reprieved</p><p>Mick Norman, 51, who has a long history of alcohol and substance abuse and crime, had been living on the streets of east London “this time around” for 18 months. Norman had been homeless on and off since 2003.

<p>What happened to the coronavirus preppers who rushed out and stripped the supermarket shelves of loo rolls, pasta and other essentials?</p><p>The loo roll went first, multipacks of it, stuffed into the boots of family cars or carted home in carrier bags. Next was the pasta, tinned soup, dried legumes and – bizarrely, given that Covid at no point threatened the UK’s water supply – mineral water. Many scoffed at these coronavirus preppers in February, dismissing them as cranks. Then, as social media filled up with images of ransacked shelves, many went out and joined them. Supermarkets had the eerie, desolate quality of a disaster movie. It was weird.</p><p>But what became of these Covid stockpilers? In February, <a href="https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/24/zombie-apocalypse-coronavirus-stockpilers-emergency-food">we met James Blake</a>, the owner of Europe’s largest emergency food supplier, in a near-empty warehouse – freeze-dried macaroni cheese and chicken fried rice were flying off the shelves – when Covid hadn’t yet reached UK shores, but was already the only thing that anyone could talk about. He ran out of his stock within weeks of our meeting. “It’s been crazy busy,” he says. “When lockdown occurred, volumes skyrocketed. We did something like two or three years’ annual turnover in two months.” It has been frenetic work, getting all these orders out and sourcing more stock. “There were 10-week waits for some orders and people were still ordering, despite that,” he says. It took him until June to clear the backlog of orders. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/16/ive-been-watering-the-plants-with-bottled-water-what-the-panic-buyers-did-next">Continue reading...</a>

<p>These evergreens are thriving due to climate change but can smother other woodland species</p><p>The holly and ivy decorations should be looking lush this Christmas thanks to climate change boosting the growth of these plants.<br /><br />In a study 15 years ago, holly was found spreading further north in Europe than ever before. The plant had pushed northwards by 80 miles (130km) in more than 60 years and was seen in Norway and Sweden where it was being used for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559830/">Christmas decorations</a> for the first time.<br /><br />Ivy is also becoming more widespread across forests in Europe. In just over 80 years it has spread across more areas of forests, with <a href="https://bit.ly/341Aq5w">rising temperatures</a> the key factor. But there is a problem with the rampant growth of both holly and ivy in woodlands, because these evergreens can easily smother and outcompete other plants in the habitat, such as primroses and violets.<br /><br />Mistletoe, though, is struggling with the changing climate, as milder winters rob it of the cold weather in winter it needs to help sprout its seeds the following spring. A study in 2005 found that the pine mistletoe in the Swiss Alps had been forced to climb about 200 metres up mountainsides in 100 years to find cooler conditions, and was expected to <a href="https://bit.ly/2W2nb02">climb a further 350 metres</a> up the slopes by 2030. <br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/dec/16/plantwatch-holly-ivy-and-how-warmer-weather-boosts-christmas-plants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her tribute to the feminist icon caused outrage at last month’s unveiling, but the artist has no regrets. She hits back at her critics – and explains why this women’s rights pioneer had to be naked</p><p>Maggi Hambling is listing her favourite sculpted penises. “The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/parthenon-marbles">Elgin marbles</a>,” she says. “Michelangelo’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jan/22/science.highereducation">David</a>. And Shelley’s, though it is rather small.” She means the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelley_Memorial">Shelley</a> memorial, Edward Onslow Ford’s attempt to depict the sea-shrunken corpse of the drowned poet. She takes a drag on her cigarette, exhales and giggles.</p><p>We’re sitting on the pavement outside the Marlborough Gallery in Mayfair so Hambling can have a cigarette. It’s stupidly cold but this is the only place we can do the interview, unless the artist quits. And that’s not going to happen. She is an incorrigible smoker, refusing to be photographed without a cigarette in hand. Until recently, the gallery made an exception, allowing Hambling to light up inside. “But the people in the offices above objected to the smell,” she says. “They threatened to close down my show.” So she has evicted herself from her own exhibition for the length of four cigarettes and a coffee.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/16/plenty-schlongs-art-maggi-hambling-defends-nude-sculpture-of-mary-wollstonecraft">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 2003 Steve Thompson helped England win the World Cup, playing a part in one of the most memorable endings to a match. Now aged 43, he finds he has no memory of the match at all – and has been diagnosed with early onset dementia. Andy Bull describes how a group of former stars are launching a legal case against the sport’s governing bodies</p><p>The 2003 World Cup final between England and Australia had gone into the last minute of extra time, with scores tied. Steve Thompson, the England hooker, threw the ball in from a line out and, as England advanced, the ball ended with Jonny Wilkinson, whose drop goal dramatically won the match for England. It’s one of the most memorable moments in recent rugby history, but Thompson, now retired aged 42, doesn’t remember it. </p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Andy Bull </strong>tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>about his investigation into rugby and dementia, during which he spoke to Thompson, one of several former players launching legal action against rugby union’s governing bodies. They claim that past failures to properly manage the safety of players who regularly received blows to the head has left some of them with debilitating conditions such as dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/16/rugbys-dementia-crisis-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
