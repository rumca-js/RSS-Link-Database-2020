This allows the starches to absorb more liquid and provides a tender and fluffy texture without the need for butter or eggs. </p><p>Be careful as some spices can affect the yeast, and often longer proving times are needed (cinnamon is particularly tricky). The prunes and dates bring sweetness and richness with all the added benefits of vitamins and fibre. My big tip is to buy a jar of malt extract. It gives an earthy depth to so many bakes and here provides a really shiny glaze.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/16/david-athertons-recipe-for-festive-plait\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/16/david-athertons-recipe-for-festive-plait", "date_published": "2020-12-16 13:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How to tackle dementia in football \u2013 Football Weekly special", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxrushden\">Max Rushden</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bglendenning\">Barry Glendenning</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris_sutton73\">Chris Sutton</a>, John Stiles and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillStewNeuro\">Dr Willie Stewart</a> discuss the prevalence of dementia in former footballers, sharing first-hand experience of the disease, the science behind the correlation between football and dementia and what needs to be done in the future</p><p><strong>Rate, review, share on </strong><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/podcast/football-weekly-the-guardian/id188674007?mt=2\"><strong>Apple Podcasts</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly\"><strong>Soundcloud</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/football-weekly\"><strong>Audioboom</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.mixcloud.com/guardianfootballweekly/\"><strong>Mixcloud</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://www.acast.com/footballweekly\"><strong>Acast</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/guardianuk/football-weekly\"><strong>Stitcher</strong></a><strong>, and join the conversation on </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GuardianPodcasts/\"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardianaudio\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"mailto:footballweekly@theguardian.com\"><strong>email</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>For this Football Weekly special <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maxrushden\">Max Rushden</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bglendenning\">Barry Glendenning</a> are joined by former Norwich, Blackburn and Celtic striker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chris_sutton73\">Chris Sutton</a>, John Stiles \u2013 son of World Cup winner Nobby Stiles \u2013 and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WillStewNeuro\">Dr Willie Stewart</a>, consultant neuropathologist at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Glasgow.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/dec/16/how-to-tackle-dementia-in-football-podcast-special\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/audio/2020/dec/16/how-to-tackle-dementia-in-football-podcast-special", "date_published": "2020-12-16 13:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Comeback review \u2013 comedy that sparkles by double act The Pin", "description": "<p><strong>No</strong><strong>\u00eb</strong><strong>l Coward theatre, London<br /></strong>Described as \u2018the cure for theatre\u2019 by producer Sonia Friedman, Alex Owen and Ben Ashenden\u2019s debut play is full of heart, pleasing pratfalls and endless flips of perspective</p><p>Announcing it earlier this autumn, producer Sonia Friedman hailed this show as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/oct/15/sonia-friedman-theatre-west-end-mental-health\">\u201cthe cure for theatre\u201d</a>.
