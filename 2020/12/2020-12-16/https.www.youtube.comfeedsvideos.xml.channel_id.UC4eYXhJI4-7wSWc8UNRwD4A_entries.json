Gotti enlisted Jay-Z and Roc Nation to sue the department of corrections for human rights violations. In our finale episode, we ask how much celebrity activism really helps the prison reform movement, and sit down with rapper Noname and organizer Mariame Kaba to consider the alternate solutions proposed by prison abolition.\n\nARTWORK by Dale Edwin Murray / MUSIC by Kassa Overall / VIDEO by Renee Klahr\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nWHAT'S \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"?\nRhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. \"Louder Than A Riot\" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles \u2014 the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts, questions and feedback.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nDecember 16, 2020 | Tom Huizenga\nFor this Tiny Desk (home) concert, we pay a visit to the doctor's office. Actually, the venue is called Rare Violins of New York and it's something of a second home to cellist Jan Vogler, who pops in frequently to have the experts give his 1708 Stradivarius cello a thorough checkup. If your multi-million-dollar fiddle has a cough or the sniffles, or even needs a full-blown restoration, Rare Violins, which sits just a block away from Carnegie Hall, can help. The firm also has a lovely music room, kitted out with a fine piano \u2013 something Vogler lacks at his place.\n\nWith help from the fine pianist Alessio Bax, Vogler makes a convincing case for Beethoven as one of the great heroes of the cello. Beethoven, whose 250th birthday falls this week, wrote five cello sonatas, plus other works for the instrument, which, before his time, was primarily relegated to beefing up the bass line in various chamber music situations.\n\nBeethoven, in essence, liberated the cello. Listen to how it dances and struts in the opening scherzo from the Sonata in A, Op. 69, and how it sings sweetly in slow section from the 12 Variations on a Theme from Handel's Judas Maccabaeus, from early in the composer's career. And finally there's the opening to Beethoven's last cello sonata, which Bax \u2014 whose role is far more than just an accompanist here \u2014 says is compact with emotion, yet \"stretches the boundaries\" for the instrument.\n\nSET LIST\nBeethoven: Cello Sonata in A, Op. 69: II.
