There\u2019s lottery scams, IRS scams, investment scams, romance scams, charity scams and many more! \n\nWhen it comes to picking your target it\u2019s about how easily you can manipulate their emotions to get them to trust you. Once you have your target, now it\u2019s time to put the scam into play.\n\nIn general, you\u2019re gonna want to find the weakest link. Which is probably gonna be a low wage worker that isn\u2019t gonna care to double check things or someone working on commission, that is incentivized to \u201coverlook\u201d certain discrepancies in order to close the sale.\n\nWhile the scam is going on, you want to make sure you look the part. If your racket is getting phony mortgages for example, you want to look clean cut and have all the bank statements and such to back yourself up.\n\nThe best con artists are just amazing salesmen. You wanna use that persuasive tonality and body language to get them under your spell.\n\nAnd there you have it! And just like when a business starts taking off, it\u2019s gonna be pretty exhilarating, addicting, and you\u2019ll want to scale up. The biggest temptation of a criminal is that when things start to heat up, it\u2019s always \u201coh just one more hit, just one more job, just one more ruse and I\u2019ll be done!\u201d \nBack in the days, con artists had to go face-to-face with the people they were ripping off. But today, most scams are done online, over long distances. \n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
