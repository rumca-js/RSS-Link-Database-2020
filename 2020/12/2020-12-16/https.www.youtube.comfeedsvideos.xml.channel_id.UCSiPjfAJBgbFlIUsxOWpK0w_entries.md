LYRICS
I never met you but I like your style
Been following you for quite a while
It’s like you’re always on some new tropical isle
I’m just another like on your profile
What are you doing your life is so beautiful
What are you doing your life is so beautiful

I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad on
Sad on Instagram
I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad
Ohhhh
 
You have nice friends and a modern home
Do you take all those pictures on your iPhone
You know I’d like to try that new restaurant
I think it’s cool that you do whatever you want
What are you doing your life is so beautiful
What are you doing your life is so beautiful

I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad on
Sad on Instagram
I’m sad on Instagram
I’m sad
Ohhhh so sad

And don’t put a filter on it
Don’t put a filter on it
Don’t put a filter on it
