Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the iconic weaponry of Call of Duty: WW2, including the M1 Garand - complete with its iconic ‘ping’ sound, the Russian PPSh-41 submachine gun, and the German STG44 Assault Rifle.

Call of Duty: WW2 saw the COD franchise return to the Second World War with a ‘boots on the ground’ shooter experience, which was full to the brim with period WW2 guns like the American Thompson M1A1, the German MP40, and the Mauser C96 semi-automatic pistol.

In the above video, Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the weapons of Call of Duty: WW2, and compares their in-game depictions against their real-world counterparts.

This week on Generation Next, the gang discuss the rise of unscrupulous scalpers who are profiting from PS5 and Series X demand to make hundreds. 

If you weren't lucky enough to secure a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S at launch, you may be going through the frustrating experience of watching for restocks and hoping you're quick enough to bag a console. What makes this process so aggravating, however, is the presence of bots--and groups that use them--that snap up all the stock in seconds and then sell them for a premium price.

We are, of course, talking about scalpers. For those familiar with the wild world of sneaker/trainer resale, you'll be intimately familiar with the difficulties of snagging a limited edition or exclusive pair before an algorithm powered bot eats up the stock. This year, however, these bots, and clandestine groups that utilize them, began to target a wider variety of highly sought after items. Most notably, Nvidia's 30 series of graphics cards have been close to impossible for the average person to buy. Naturally, Sony and Microsoft's new consoles have also become targets, with some groups snatching thousands of consoles for themselves.

On this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor break down what's going on with scalpers and the retail bots, as well as look at whether any of it is actually illegal, what can be done, and also their own experiences with scalping or selling hot ticket items at a premium.
