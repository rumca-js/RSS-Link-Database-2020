I built the fastest (to my knowledge) native SATA RAID array on a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4, and set it up as a NAS server, testing out hard drives and SSDs, and different RAID setups like RAID 0, 1, and 10.

I discuss the advantages of different RAID levels, how to install and configure Samba and NFS, and benchmark everything, from drive to RAID performance, energy efficiency, temperatures, and more!
