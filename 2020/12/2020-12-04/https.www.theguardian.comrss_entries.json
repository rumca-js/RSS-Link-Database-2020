I take my voice and the sounds of many of the instruments I play, and I sculpt them.<br /><br />Every week or two, I upload a tune to streaming sites. Making music used to be my profession rather than a hobby, but that distinction now gives me a feeling of immense freedom. I can create my music in any way I like.
