Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nDec. 4, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- With a genuine smile stretched across her face, Dua Lipa seems overjoyed to reconnect with her band for their only performance since their tour in support of her sophomore album, Future Nostalgia, was cancelled in March. Glowing from the inside out and accentuated by the apricot hues of a backdrop in a London studio, Dua and her backup vocalists and band bring life and warmth into households in need of \"levitating\" and some pep in their step this winter. This vibrant four song set of dance hits, all from Future Nostalgia, will surely have you cutting up the floor in your kitchen while quarantining in the cold weather.\n\nWhile we can't film our Tiny Desk concerts at NPR's D.C. office during the pandemic, our \"home\" series has created opportunity for global megastars like Dua Lipa to bring her uptempo dance joints all the way from London. Of Kosovar Albanian descent, Dua Lipa was raised in the UK and rose to super stardom in the three years since her eponymous debut album dropped in 2017. NPR Music featured her in our docu-series Noteworthy at the onset of her career. It's been extraordinary to witness her colossal takeover of the pop music landscape. Dua sums the times during her intro of \"Love Again\": \"It's about manifesting good things into your life, when things aren't quite going your way.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Levitating\"\n\"Pretty Please\"\n\"Love Again\"\n\"Don't Start Now\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nDua Lipa: vocals\nMatthew Carroll: bass\nAlex Lanyon: guitar\nNaomi Scarlett: vocals\nCiara O'Connor: vocals\nIzzy Chase: vocals\nMatt Maijah: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Ceremony London, James Barnes\nAudio: WFB Live, Will Nicholson\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F4neLJQC1_E", "date_published": "2020-12-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": "rumpel", "language": "en-US"}]
