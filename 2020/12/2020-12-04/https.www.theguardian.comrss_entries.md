Pantos can be full-throttle from the start, and their audiences bring on a headache before the show has even begun, so it’s disconcerting to sit in silence watching such a quiet, sombre scene. But wait, the pair suggest, couldn’t a digital production enable them to do all sorts of “whizzy things” and let their imagination run beyond the limits of the theatre?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/04/jack-and-the-beanstalk-review-online-panto-is-fee-fi-fo-fun">Continue reading...</a>

## Obama's lesson for Labour: words matter, even when it's not you who's talking | Jonathan Freedland

<p>‘Defund the police’ landed badly with some US voters. Starmer needs to be wary of ‘snappy slogans’ too</p><p>Let’s plunge into the gap between what people say and what other people hear. All kinds of things can grow in that space, many of them poisonous. In that gap, friendships, even marriages, have come apart; wars can start.</p><p>This week, Barack Obama shone a light into that zone when he talked about the slogan that many Democrats believe cost the party seats in the House of Representatives and Senate last month, a phrase that took flight during the summer of protests against the killing of George Floyd: defund the police. The <a href="https://twitter.com/fran_chambers/status/1334120230864433156?s=20">former president said</a> he too wanted to reform the criminal justice system, ridding it of racial bias, but he feared that using that “snappy slogan” meant “you lost a big audience the minute you say it”. The very change activists wanted moved further out of reach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/04/barack-obama-lesson-british-left-words-matter-defund-the-police-us">Continue reading...</a>

Drake, the Canadian rapper who has had six UK No 1 singles, was first in three of the previous five years, with fellow UK chart-toppers Ed Sheeran and Post Malone leading the others.</p><p>But in 2020, someone who has never had an album or solo single in the UK Top 100 is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/01/bad-bunny-is-most-streamed-artist-2020-on-spotify">the world’s most popular artist</a>: 26-year-old Puerto Rican vocalist Bad Bunny, streamed more than 8.3bn times this year on Spotify alone.

Meanwhile, Bad Bunny’s current (and superb) single <a href="https://youtu.be/TmKh7lAwnBI">Dakiti</a> is the most-played in the world at time of writing, earning more than 7m plays each day, 3m more than Ariana Grande’s Positions in second place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/04/how-did-bad-bunny-become-the-worlds-biggest-pop-star">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’d never previously considered how often people in public-facing jobs fall ill, or that we shouldn’t visit the elderly when we have a respiratory illness</p><p>It felt as if everybody had hunkered down for a long argument premised on the idea that the vaccine was years away. “It is a distant dream, therefore we should learn to live with death,” was one side of it, the other side being: “Or maybe we could learn to live with this completely different way of living?” I wasn’t expecting either to win in a hurry, but still less was I expecting the vaccine to actually arrive, not as a trial, or a hope, but as 800,000 vials, all containing something that apparently works.</p><p>And this has hurled us so fast into a different argument that even two people on the same (metaphorical) podium cannot agree. The prime minister is promising a maskless nirvana just around the corner, where we all hug and kiss like it’s 2019. England’s<strong> </strong>deputy chief medical officer, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/03/how-jonathan-van-tam-won-the-nations-trust-on-coronavirus">Jonathan Van-Tam</a>, is counselling that people may still want to take precautions for many months, even years, to come. People who miss the office are already doing that thing where their tie very subtly matches their socks. People who hated the office are pronouncing it dead. How normal you predict 2021 will be depends heavily on what you would prefer “normal” to look like. As time unfurls, I suspect that it will rearrange itself around the preferences of experts, purely because they make more noise. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/04/pandemic-lesson-think-harder-about-who-we-sneeze-on">Continue reading...</a>

She’s excited to see her mum again for Christmas, but anxious about going back to Ullapool, her remote home town of 1,500 people in the Highlands. “I don’t think I could deal with the knowledge I brought the virus home to a fragile and precious community, and to my family,” she says.</p><p>Ross is taking every precaution possible: she’s been self-isolating and will be driven north by a friend’s mum after taking a coronavirus test. She wants to spend time with her mum, an exhausted NHS worker who lives alone after her husband – Helen’s father – passed away during Helen’s freshers week. “She’s been getting through the last slog of the year by looking forward to having me,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/dec/04/this-terms-been-rough-emotionally-the-students-heading-home-for-christmas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US president’s refusal to concede the election looks unnervingly familiar to a classicist – ancient Rome offers valuable lessons about letting go of power</p><p>A lot of men have probably wished for four more years. A little under that time after assuming absolute power, Gaius Caesar was dead, assassinated by the men who were paid to protect him. We more usually know him as Caligula: a man who revealed himself to be every kind of monster soon after becoming emperor of Rome.</p><p>It probably wasn’t his depravity that did for Caligula, however: if our sources are to be believed, sexual deviance was pretty much par for Roman emperors. Abusing so much power must have been irresistible. Perhaps the reasoning was that when you’re a star, they let you do it. The real problem for the men surrounding him was his unpredictability. At the time of his death, he was pondering giving high political office to Incitatus, his favourite horse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/04/decline-and-fall-what-donald-trump-can-learn-from-the-roman-emperors">Continue reading...</a>

## Republicans are standing up to Trump. Unfortunately, it's too little, too late | Rebecca Solnit

<p>Republicans like Gabriel Sterling – who are horrified by the torrent of death threats facing electoral workers – are voicing their outrage very late in the day</p><p>The first time I watched Georgia voting systems implementation manager Gabriel Sterling’s furious tirade about the threats against him and his coworkers, I was impressed. Here was a Republican, a self-described conservative, telling off the president and all the people making those threats. “Death threats. Physical threats. Intimidation. They have lost the moral high ground. I don’t have all the words for this because I am angry.” He was clearly furious. He talked about a young contract worker: “There’s a noose out there with his name on it. This kid just took a job and it’s just wrong. I just can’t begin to explain the level of anger I have right now … Mr President, it looks like you probably lost the state of Georgia. Stop inspiring people to commit acts of violence.”</p><p>It didn’t take long for me to sour on his indignation. They never had the moral high ground. The death threats and intimidation against him and his co-workers are wrong. However, they’re not the first people to get them but in some sense the last, and if you care about people the president has attacked verbally and urged violence against, you could have started caring during the 2016 campaign. Nothing suggests Mr Sterling did, since he belongs to a party that has supported Trump and, more broadly, campaigns of hate and discrimination for the last 40 years and more. In recent years, Trump has urged police to treat arrestees more roughly, audiences to harass and even rough up journalists and dissidents in his crowds, and is well-known for the 26 credible accounts of sexual abuse and violence with which women have charged him. He’s the guy who pardoned Sheriff Joe Arpaio in 2017 for his conviction for disobeying a judge’s order to stop racial profiling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/04/republicans-are-standing-up-to-trump-unfortunately-its-too-little-too-late">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The substantial meal debate at least distracted us from PM and Matt Hancock’s dull briefings </p><p>Where’s Priti Patel, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, Alok Sharma and Oliver Dowden when you need them? They may all have their limitations as cabinet ministers but they did used to liven up the Downing Street press conferences with their incompetence. I especially miss Sharma who was a joy to sketch as he never knowingly answered a direct question with a direct answer and I could never quite work out whether that was because he hadn’t really understood the question or genuinely had no idea of the answer he was expected to give. Perhaps both. Now the twice weekly briefings are shared between Boris Johnson, who tends to hog the ones where there might be some good news on offer, and Matt Hancock – the prime minister’s preferred patsy – who gets to do all the ones where there is bad news or no news. They are much more boring as a result because Boris just waffles on in a sub-Churchillian haze while Hancock sounds more and more like the floor manager in a department store. In some weeks I find myself sketching Hancock at least twice and I long for the time when I can ignore him for a month as I’m worried I’m running out of anything new to say about him. But I find myself obliged to carry on, like someone engaged in a dysfunctional relationship, just to see how the whole thing pans out. Still, we have had the scotch egg drama to keep us entertained as the government once again tried to make up policy as it went along. First we had the environment secretary, George Eustice, saying <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/30/scotch-egg-to-the-rescue-minister-says-it-can-be-substantial-meal">a scotch egg constituted a substantial meal</a>, only for him to be contradicted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/01/scotch-egg-is-definitely-a-substantial-meal-says-michael-gove">Gove</a>, who maintained that two scotch eggs were a decent starter. Personally, I’ve never much liked them anyway but if I was invited out for a meal only to be served a single scotch egg, I’d feel mighty pissed off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/dec/04/boris-johnson-scotch-eggs-waffle">Continue reading...</a>

We also did some red countries. I remember thinking: “What is a red country?” I didn’t understand. We went to see A Clockwork Orange in Copenhagen. It was nice to find a theatre where the films hadn’t been dubbed, and it was a hot ticket, so that was probably the criteria. I don’t think that the twentysomething cinema usher realised what Kubrick had in for us when she allowed nine-year-old me in to see it. I remember the scene where they are pouring milk laced with drugs from the mannequin’s breasts. I’m still scarred. I was taken to lots of movies that I probably shouldn’t have seen. I don’t remember the names; I just remember the violence and the sex. It got my perspectives all mixed up. My first impressions into adulthood were that sex and violence were cool and hip.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/04/diane-lanes-teenage-obsessions-im-still-scarred-by-a-clockwork-orange">Continue reading...</a>

The US startup took a biopsy of cells from a live chicken, bathed them in a nutrient medium and grew them in a bioreactor, where they grew exponentially until the meat was harvested, encased in batter and turned into nuggets. The ruling means that, for the first time, cultured meat can be sold to the public.</p><p>Eat Just, Inc – and the <a href="https://www.gfi.org/non-cms-pages/splash-sites/soi-reports/files/SOI-Report-Cell-Based.pdf">dozens of other cultured meat startups</a> racing each other to get lab-grown meat on to the menu across the globe – are selling the promise that carnivores will be able to eat meat with a clean conscience. Flesh without the blood, meat without murder and the beginning of the end of the environmental damage caused by intensive animal agriculture.
