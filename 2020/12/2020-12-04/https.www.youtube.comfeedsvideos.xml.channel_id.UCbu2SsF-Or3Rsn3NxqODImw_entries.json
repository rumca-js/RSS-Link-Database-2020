What makes this process so aggravating, however, is the presence of bots--and groups that use them--that snap up all the stock in seconds and then sell them for a premium price.\n\nWe are, of course, talking about scalpers. For those familiar with the wild world of sneaker/trainer resale, you'll be intimately familiar with the difficulties of snagging a limited edition or exclusive pair before an algorithm powered bot eats up the stock. This year, however, these bots, and clandestine groups that utilize them, began to target a wider variety of highly sought after items. Most notably, Nvidia's 30 series of graphics cards have been close to impossible for the average person to buy. Naturally, Sony and Microsoft's new consoles have also become targets, with some groups snatching thousands of consoles for themselves.\n\nOn this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor break down what's going on with scalpers and the retail bots, as well as look at whether any of it is actually illegal, what can be done, and also their own experiences with scalping or selling hot ticket items at a premium.\u00a0\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:30 - Why you can't buy a PS5 or Xbox Series X right now\n04:09 - Have you ever bought anything from a scalper?\n07:42 - Is it illegal to use bots to scalp PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles?\n14:30 - What can retailers do about scalpers?\n21:34 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7CaLw_Gm4c", "date_published": "2020-12-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Rainbow Six Siege: PS5 vs PC Graphics Comparison", "description": "As Rainbow Six Siege's newest update incorporates PS5 and Xbox Series X|S upgrades, we see how the PS5 looks compared to a high-end PC.\n\n\nPC Specs:\nRTX 2070 Super\nIntel i9-9900K CPU @ 3.60GHz\n16GB RAM\n\n\n\n\u00a0The latest big update for Rainbow Six Siege includes the long-awaited upgrades for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but just how much better does the game look?\n\nWe put the game to the test.
