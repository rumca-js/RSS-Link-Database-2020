Many new movies have had to be viewed at home, on streaming services, and cinephiles have had to accept this arrangement, rather like gourmets who see their favourite restaurants survive by repurposing themselves as delivery and takeaway centres. And streaming has, arguably, given a new audience to independent and arthouse cinema that might not otherwise have much of a showing in theatres.</p><p>Lockdown has intensified the debate about the validity of the small-screen experience of cinema \u2013 and it\u2019s especially intense for me, when I consider one of my favourite films of the year. Steve McQueen\u2019s Lovers Rock is one of the glorious works in McQueen\u2019s superb five-movie Small Axe sequence about the Black British experience. It is gloriously cinematic and was slated to feature at this year\u2019s (cancelled) Cannes film festival. But it was commissioned by the BBC, and so the vast majority of the people enjoying this wonderful film will be doing so on the small screen. That\u2019s why it is being described, understandably, as one the television highlights of the year.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/17/the-2020-braddies-peter-bradshaw-films-picks-of-the-year\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/17/the-2020-braddies-peter-bradshaw-films-picks-of-the-year", "date_published": "2020-12-17 09:18:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Millions in England tier 3 areas await ruling on Christmas Covid rules", "description": "<p>Political leaders make case for hospitality businesses to reopen but few believe rules will be relaxed</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Millions of people living under the highest level of coronavirus restrictions in England are waiting nervously to hear whether they will be able to go to the pub or out for a meal before Christmas ahead of an announcement on the government\u2019s tiering system on Thursday morning.</p><p>Though political leaders have been publicly making the case for their towns and cities to be moved out of tier 3 so that their hospitality businesses can reopen, few hold out real hope that they will be relaxed ahead of Christmas \u2013 particularly after London was moved into the highest tier earlier this week.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/englands-tier-3-millions-await-ruling-on-christmas-covid-rules\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/englands-tier-3-millions-await-ruling-on-christmas-covid-rules", "date_published": "2020-12-17 09:15:53+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Buy a classic sport photograph: the immortal Bobby Moore", "description": "<p>The latest in a Guardian Print Shop <a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/the-big-sport-picture\">series</a> featuring classic sports images.

The novel, about two young people falling in and out of love in post-crash Ireland, was a huge bestseller as soon as it arrived, on the back of almost universal critical acclaim and passionate word-of-mouth. A Man Booker nomination came and went; Obama liked it; within two books, Rooney had become the Voice of a Generation.
