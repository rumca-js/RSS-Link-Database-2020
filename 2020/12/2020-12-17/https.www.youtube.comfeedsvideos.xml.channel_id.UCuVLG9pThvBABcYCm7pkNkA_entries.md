First and foremost, go watch the Frontline documentary, 'Plastic Wars' on this subject. They did it WAAAY more professionally than me, although I feel like they used more swear words? I can't remember. Seriously though, it's a fantastic watch and it's available for exactly zero dollars right here on y'tube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dk3NOEgX7o
Or this if you're in the UK: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXzee3tIZco&feature=youtu.be

Also, the good people over at Wendover Productions have a video about why recycling doesn't work that's so insanely well-done that you should go back in time and watch that one first: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXRtNwUju5g
