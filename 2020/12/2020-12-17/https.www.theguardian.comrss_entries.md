## Park life in Edinburgh Gardens: 'It’s a good representation of Melbourne’s cultural evolution'

<p>Built as an antidote to the ills of urban living, 150 years on, the park is playing exactly the role it was intended for</p><p>This week community contention around the use of one of Melbourne’s most beloved parks came to a head. A small group of local residents took<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/fight-over-the-right-to-party-at-edinburgh-gardens-as-council-mulls-alcohol-ban-20201210-p56m87.html"> their concerns</a> about the purported bacchanalia unfolding at Edinburgh Gardens since lockdowns eased to the council. Then more than 2,000 park-users signed a petition insisting the city of Yarra reject any call for an outright booze ban. Alcohol is already banned in the gardens after 9pm.</p><p>On 15 December, the council – which last month became Australia’s first Greens-majority council – <a href="https://www.yarracity.vic.gov.au/news/2020/12/16/yarra-wants-its-parks-to-be-enjoyed-by-everyone-in-the-community">unanimously voted down the residents’ proposal</a>, considering more cleaning and toilets instead. Melbourne’s extraordinary lockdown success is cause for much (socially distanced) celebration, putting public green space at a premium. As we relish our hard-earned Covid-normal summer in these shared spaces, let’s consider why our parks exist at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/dec/17/life-in-edinburgh-gardens-a-representation-of-melbournes-cultural-evolution">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson is privatising responsibility for the problems caused by his Christmas plan to lift restrictions while cases are rising</p><p>From Saturday, two-thirds of England will be in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/parts-of-south-and-east-of-england-move-to-covid-tier-3-as-bristol-downgraded" title="">tier 3</a>, the most<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/16/tier-3-lockdown-rules-in-england-latest-covid-restrictions-explained" title=""> severe</a> category of the UK government’s Covid restrictions. This change, announced by the health secretary, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/oral-statement-on-review-of-coronavirus-tiering-restrictions-in-england" title="">Matt Hancock</a>, on Thursday, is the product of two contradictory things. The first is that coronavirus cases are rising fast in the south-east and east of England, while case numbers also remain high in much of the urban north. The second is that the government has also committed to a temporary UK-wide Christmas lifting of restrictions in less than a week’s time, after which the new tighter tier restrictions will resume.</p><p>These are contradictory approaches, and they cannot be reconciled on a scientific basis. If the virus is surging, there is no public health logic in lifting the restrictions over Christmas. The reason why the lifting of restrictions will go ahead is largely political. It is because Boris Johnson promised a nearly normal Christmas long ago and does not want the embarrassment of an unpopular U-turn. Many households took him at his word and have made preparations that would be difficult, expensive and distressing to abandon – though there is evidence that plenty are now <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/there-are-no-good-options-britons-torn-over-christmas-gatherings-covid" title="">doing just that</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/17/the-guardian-view-of-englands-covid-19-tiers-a-licence-to-divide">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the first time, air pollution has been recognised as a cause of death. The dangers are known, and people of colour are most at risk</p><p>I live less than five minutes from the road that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/16/girls-death-contributed-to-by-air-pollution-coroner-rules-in-landmark-case">killed Ella Kissi-Debrah</a>. Like so many in our community, I spend much of my life near the South Circular, a major road that runs through south London, whether I’m walking to the train station or catching a bus, and I can often hear the traffic. In a landmark ruling, Ella has now become the first person in the UK to have air pollution officially recognised by a coroner as a cause of death.</p><p>The result of the inquest will, first and foremost, give some sense of justice to the family. I was in Ella’s year at primary school. After she died at just nine years old in February 2013, I saw her mum, Rosamund, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/16/ella-kissi-debrah-mother-fight-justice-air-pollution-death">spend years fighting</a> for the death to be examined by a second coroner. Thanks to this courageous campaign, which included finding expert medical advice, the second coroner concluded that “air pollution was a significant contributory factor to both the induction and exacerbation of her asthma”. As Rosamund has said, the judgment means that the family can finally rest – and have a Christmas knowing that some justice is done.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/17/breathe-air-ella-kissi-debrah-ruling-pollution-death">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I was 15 and desperate to escape small-town England. But all the champagne and roquefort in the world couldn’t make up for the hurt I caused the family I left behind</p><p>It’s hard for me to pinpoint the exact age when I learned the lesson that family must come first at this time of year. But my best guess is December 1988, when I would have been 15 years old. There is some dispute in my family about the age I was at the time and whether this event happened in quite the way I remember it. But I have a clear picture of it in my mind.</p><p>It was the Christmas before my GCSEs and, being a swot, perfectionist and all-round smartarse, I was completely obsessed with acing them. These exams represented – or so I believed – the passport out of the small town in Somerset where I grew up and a one-way ticket to an exciting independent adult life. (Spoiler alert: I’m still searching for this.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/17/my-dream-of-a-fancy-french-noel-left-my-grandad-in-tears">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Alongside our countdown of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/01/the-50-best-films-of-2020">the best films of 2020</a>, our chief film critic selects his favourite movies, directors and performances of the year</p><p>As for everyone and everything else, this has been a traumatising year for cinema. Many new movies have had to be viewed at home, on streaming services, and cinephiles have had to accept this arrangement, rather like gourmets who see their favourite restaurants survive by repurposing themselves as delivery and takeaway centres. And streaming has, arguably, given a new audience to independent and arthouse cinema that might not otherwise have much of a showing in theatres.</p><p>Lockdown has intensified the debate about the validity of the small-screen experience of cinema – and it’s especially intense for me, when I consider one of my favourite films of the year. Steve McQueen’s Lovers Rock is one of the glorious works in McQueen’s superb five-movie Small Axe sequence about the Black British experience. It is gloriously cinematic and was slated to feature at this year’s (cancelled) Cannes film festival. But it was commissioned by the BBC, and so the vast majority of the people enjoying this wonderful film will be doing so on the small screen. That’s why it is being described, understandably, as one the television highlights of the year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/17/the-2020-braddies-peter-bradshaw-films-picks-of-the-year">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Keir Starmer’s stumbling response to a LBC caller highlights the risks of playing on hostile terrain </p><p>What is deemed permissible in mainstream public life and what is not? Survey the British media landscape and you’ll find some answers. Two years ago Nick Ferrari, presenter of LBC’s flagship show, was on a Sky News panel with my colleague Afua Hirsch. She had eloquently questioned the glorification of British historical figures guilty of racist crimes. “Why do you stay in this country?” Ferrari responded. “I’m delighted that I see you each Thursday … but if it offends you so much, how do you manage to stay here?”</p><p>Phrases such as “Go back to where you came from” have long been a staple cry of the street-level racist. For a national radio presenter to evoke this line of questioning because someone dared to critique the nation’s chequered history should have been a moment of scandal, but it wasn’t. <a href="https://twitter.com/krishgm/status/1270343145671270406">Some spoke out</a>, but most did not. Ferrari remains a respectable broadcaster, who continues to <a href="https://radiotoday.co.uk/2020/07/nick-ferrari-picks-up-gold-at-the-irn-awards/">collect awards</a> for his work. His example isn’t isolated. Last year, Tom Newton Dunn, then the Sun’s political editor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/09/sun-publish-far-right-conspiracy-theory-labour">published a far-right conspiracy theory</a> partly sourced from neo-Nazi websites featuring <strong> </strong>links between leftwing figures (including me) and “illegal terror organisations”. The article was simply deleted after publication, no explanation given. Newton Dunn’s career flourishes, and his colleagues and peers remain silent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/17/labour-rightwing-media-culture-war-keir-starmer-lbc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s bestseller about two young people falling in and out of love in post-crash Ireland is intimate, touching and tender</p><p>All the way back in 2018, even among fans, it was easy to feel that Sally Rooney’s Normal People was the most tiresome subject of the year. The novel, about two young people falling in and out of love in post-crash Ireland, was a huge bestseller as soon as it arrived, on the back of almost universal critical acclaim and passionate word-of-mouth. A Man Booker nomination came and went; Obama liked it; within two books, Rooney had become the Voice of a Generation. And as is the modern way with a cultural touchstone, we almost ruined something admirable and popular with a barrage of scrutiny. Countless thinkpieces announced that we held a future classic in our hands, or the worst book ever written. Before Lenny Abrahamson and Hettie MacDonald’s adaptation for BBC/Hulu even started filming, it was hard to imagine there would be anything new to say in two years’ time.</p><p>Yet for all the noise around Normal People, the TV adaptation is remarkable in its quietness. Just like its source material, it is intimate and tender, a coming-of-age tale told through meaningful silences and gentle caresses more often than whizz-bang dialogue. But where the book is cool and sharp, the show is dreamier, lingering as it does on hazy afternoon sun spilling across a messy bed, a summer in an Italian villa, closeups of flushed skin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/17/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2020-no-4-normal-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Versus Niall Ferguson and Jordan Peterson ... a set of essays from a writer who excels at calling out intellectual vapidities but now needs to ask new questions</p><p>In 1988, Pankaj Mishra was a would-be writer in Varanasi, north India, whiling away his days reading the American critic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/18/usa.biography">Edmund Wilson</a>. In books such as <em>Axel’s Castle</em> and <em>To the Finland Station</em>, Mishra detected a temperament he could aspire to: erudite, self-assured, swiftly able to read between the lines of a book into the author’s worldview and the wider social and historical milieu, “a man wholly devoted to reading and thinking and writing”. But years later, trying to write on Wilson, Mishra realised that he had nothing new to say about his hero. “It hadn’t occurred to me,” he wrote, “that a separate narrative probably existed in my private discovery of Wilson’s writings in a dusty old library in the ancient town of Benares [Varanasi].”</p><p>The story of his “private discovery” of Wilson was published in the New York Review of Books 20 years ago and marked a breakthrough moment for Mishra. It was boom time for South Asian writing in English at the turn of the millennium. Arundhati Roy’s <em>The God Of Small Things</em> had just come out; Vikram Seth’s million-dollar advance for <em>A Suitable Boy </em>was much talked about; the New Yorker devoted an entire issue to Indians writing in English. Mishra transformed the NYRB article into a novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/13/fiction.reviews3">called </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/feb/13/fiction.reviews3">The Romantics</a></em>, but he blossomed more as a critic and essayist. His dispatches from all over Asia – Kashmir, Tibet, China, Indonesia, Nepal, Japan, Afghanistan – made perceptive connections between local events and precedents in other parts of the world. His best-known books are subversive histories, reviewing the contexts in which individuals in different places and eras have arrived at remarkably similar ideas; he has traced outlines of continuity between the Buddha and Oscar Wilde, Rousseau and Trump.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/17/bland-fanatics-by-pankaj-mishra-review-anglo-american-delusions">Continue reading...</a>

Montreal is one of the finest cities for record shopping.

On a pilgrimage there, I knocked on what looked like someone’s front door – pushchair and children’s shoes in the porch – expecting to be in the wrong place. Greeted by someone holding a beer, we were invited into a wood-panelled back room that smelled like dust and discovery, the walls plastered with posters and stacks of tapes on the windowsill and under the record bins.

## Guy Reid-Bailey: the man who sparked the Bristol bus boycott and then fought to desegregate housing

<p>When he arrived in the UK in 1961, the teenager was shocked by the injustice – and violence – of the racism he faced. So he decided to take some action</p><p>Guy Reid-Bailey was a hero of a civil rights movement in the UK that is only now being given its due. A central figure in the struggle to end the unofficial segregation – the notorious “colour bar” – rampant in the UK in the 1960s, he took part in the Bristol bus boycott, which is credited with encouraging politicians to bring in the first Race Relations Act in 1965. He went on to found the first black housing association in Bristol and set up a cricket club to challenge discrimination in sport – one that is still bringing joy to generations of black Bristolians today.</p><p>When he arrived in Britain in 1961 at the age of 16, Reid-Bailey was a self-described “country boy” from Jamaica. His parents had sent him to live with his aunt in Bristol, assuming that the “mother country” would give him a good education. But he quickly realised, he says, that it was “a mother without any affection for black people”. Reid-Bailey had three brothers in Jamaica, but told them not to follow him to the UK because “I had to grow up very quickly and I wouldn’t wish my other brothers to experience what I did”. Not much has changed in that regard. He still believes that “if you’re a black person, you suffer a mental lack of freedom”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/17/guy-reid-bailey-the-man-who-sparked-the-bristol-bus-boycott-and-then-fought-to-desegregate-housing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pristine club-pop on this energetic album owes a great debt to the musical past but sounds magically, wonderfully of the moment</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/01/the-50-best-albums-of-2020">Follow our countdown of the 50 best albums of 2020</a></li></ul><p>For <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/dua-lipa">Dua Lipa</a>, 2020 began with a puddle of tears and it ended the same way. When her second album leaked in April, the singer sobbed her way through an Instagram video explaining that she’d brought the release of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/mar/27/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review">Future Nostalgia</a> forward by a week. She didn’t know if the early days of a pandemic-induced lockdown was the right time for a record so heavily calibrated for the dancefloor. But she needn’t have worried: in a year fraught with anxiety and fear, a shot of future nostalgia was just the thing.</p><p>The album fizzes with coiled energy, each of the 11 songs delivering a euphoric high over an irresistible beat. The track that gives the album its name contains the brassy line: “You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste.” It’s true, but it’s also not – the album owes a great debt to the musical past, nostalgic itself for the costume jewelled glitz of disco and the Day-Glo of 80s powerpop and those who have gone before. Among others, it references Olivia Newton-John, turn of the millennium Madonna, 1930s bandleader Lew Stone (and by extension, 1990s White Town), 1980s INXS, Lily Allen and the Who. Deftly cajoling these disparate sounds into a lithe 43 minutes of pristine club-pop music that does sound incredibly <em>now</em> is nothing short of alchemy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/17/the-50-best-albums-of-2020-no-2-dua-lipa-future-nostalgia">Continue reading...</a>

## How Julia Donaldson conquered the world, one rhyme at a time

<p>She published her first book in her 40s and became the biggest selling author of the past decade in any genre – The Gruffalo alone has sold 13m copies. How did this former busker make it so big?</p><p>The room where the children’s author Julia Donaldson writes – the heart of her vast picture book empire – is down a winding staircase, in the cellar of her grand white house in Steyning, West Sussex. Her desk looks out on the street at knee height. “I’m thinking of writing a book about legs,” Donaldson said, as she showed me around the house this summer. Children from the nearby school often wave in at her as they pass. Donaldson is well known in Steyning, due to her frequent signings at the local bookshop. She and her husband, Malcolm, a retired paediatrician, recently bought the local post office to save it from closure. But elsewhere she can walk the pavement without being recognised. “I got a letter the other day for Jacqueline Wilson,” Donaldson told me. “It said: ‘You’re my favourite author!’”</p><p>If you are not someone who spends much time with young children, you may only be dimly aware of Donaldson’s work – although you will probably be familiar with her most famous creation, the Gruffalo. If you have children, however, you will know her as a cultural juggernaut whose influence among children is perhaps only surpassed by the works of Disney and CBeebies. Donaldson, who is 72, has written more than <a href="https://www.juliadonaldson.co.uk/about.htm" title="">210 books</a>: chiefly picture books, but also poetry, plays, a 60-part phonics reading scheme and a novel for preteens. Many of them – such as Room on the Broom, The Snail and the Whale, and What the Ladybird Heard – are already considered classics. Several have been adapted into stage shows and animated BBC films (the latest, Zog &amp; the Flying Doctors, will air on Christmas Day) and spawned an ever-expanding Donaldson universe of toys, clothing and merchandise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/dec/17/julia-donaldson-conquered-world-one-rhyme-at-a-time-childrens-literature-gruffalo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘The singer came to my loft for a party. She was quite a presence. I gave her those earrings.

The band played the <a href="http://www.sheen-resistance.com/danceteria-new-york-club/">Danceteria</a>. My friend Edwige and I went along. I hadn’t met Sade before but I knew their music. It was great – so different, so smooth. I grew up with Roxy Music. Sade felt like a 1980s version of that. Afterwards, the plan was for them to come to a party at my loft. My friend Michelle was going out with a bandmember and Edwige knew them too. She had a huge crush on Sade. I have a shot of the two of them, another of Sade looking directly at me, and this one.</p><p>Sade was a quiet presence, but such a beauty, and so stylish: imposing, statuesque, with glowing skin, big eyes, red lipstick – a goddess. She had her hair pulled back in a braided bun and was wearing a big skirt with this quite masculine shirt. She just stood there, watching the room. Maybe she felt like she was missing out on the action. Or maybe there was somebody of interest she was looking at.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/17/sade-electrifies-new-york-party-maripols-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

In among the more obviously kid-oriented Toy Stories and Cars, this strand of Pixar’s output has originated a string of sensational classics: Wall-E, Up, Inside Out.</p><p>Well, Soul sees Pixar hitting another one out the park – and it’s perhaps unsurprising that it has Up and Inside Out director Pete Docter’s name at the top, as director and co-writer. (Another of the writers, One Night in Miami’s Kemp Powers, gets a co-director credit.) In broad terms, Soul appears to be a hybrid of Inside Out, with its literal rendering of internal psychological constructs, and Coco, the more traditional-looking afterlife yarn. What Pixar have come up with is a hypermodern spirit-world fable that also looks back to classical anchoring values with a touch of hippy-era mysticism: music, art, self-expression, rites of passage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/17/the-50-best-films-of-2020-in-the-uk-no-2-soul">Continue reading...</a>
