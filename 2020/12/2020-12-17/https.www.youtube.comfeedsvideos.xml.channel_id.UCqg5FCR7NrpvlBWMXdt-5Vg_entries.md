Bluepoint Games’ Demon’s Souls remake for PlayStation 5 does an amazing job of preserving what was incredible and pure about the 2009 original, while simultaneously updating so many aspects of the game to a tremendous level. The music, lighting, and atmosphere are as impactful as ever, portraying the remnants of the Kingdom of Boletaria in remarkable detail. And the slew of quality-of-life improvements make the inevitable litany of deaths you’ll experience throughout the game all the more manageable.
