This video explains how humans evolved humor, what makes something funny (according to your brain) and what scientists have found is "funniest joke in the world".

It also tackles why comedians keep getting cancelled, the benign violation theory and teaches you how to be a better comedian. Over Simplified, and Dude Perfect are funny because even they are making unsafe situations, safe. Even Billie Eilish comes off as funny, as her normal self is so separate to the spooky songs. I also show you the first time I ever did stand up, which makes me so nervous. All in all, it is a deep scientific dive into the science of humor.
