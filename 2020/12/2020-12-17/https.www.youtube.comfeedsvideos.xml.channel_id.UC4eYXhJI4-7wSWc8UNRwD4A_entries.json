Gotti enlisted Jay-Z and Roc Nation to sue the department of corrections for human rights violations. In our finale episode, we ask how much celebrity activism really helps the prison reform movement, and sit down with rapper Noname and organizer Mariame Kaba to consider the alternate solutions proposed by prison abolition.\n\nARTWORK by Dale Edwin Murray / MUSIC by Kassa Overall / VIDEO by Renee Klahr\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nWHAT'S \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"?\nRhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. \"Louder Than A Riot\" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles \u2014 the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts, questions and feedback.
