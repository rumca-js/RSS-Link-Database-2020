## Brexit fishing gamble suggests No 10 forgot its economics homework

<p><strong>Analysis</strong>: exasperation as fates and fortunes of large industries reliant on efforts to expand much smaller one</p><p>An island nation can be forgiven for a preoccupation with fish. But with less than a month until the UK’s trade with the EU moves to new rules – whether under a deal or no-deal scenario – it is possible that continuing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/30/eu-not-fall-into-brexit-negotiating-trap-fishing-uk-told">attempts to gain a win for British fishing industry</a> could scupper much larger parts of the UK economy.</p><p>Fishing is a politically charged issue on both sides of the Channel. Boris Johnson has talked of the UK becoming “an independent coastal state” and exploiting the “recapture of our spectacular natural marine wealth”, while Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, has warned the UK against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/sep/07/economic-peanuts-political-dynamite-how-fishing-rights-could-sink-a-uk-eu-trade-deal">using fish as a “bargaining chip”</a> (apparently not a pun on Britain’s national dish).

## Sue Owen obituary

<p>Sue Owen, my mother, who has died aged 70, was for many years a teacher in adult education, helping people gain a second chance to achieve qualifications or enter university. She went on to lead a teacher training unit for Manchester’s adult education service, and her final job after retirement was teaching English at the Wai Yin Society, a Chinese cultural centre in central Manchester.</p><p>She was fascinated by foreign cultures and languages, and mastered German, Spanish, Russian and French. Throughout her life, she would always attempt to learn at least some of the language before going abroad, often to the surprise of waiters or tour guides.<br /><br />Sue was born in a British army hospital in Wuppertal, West Germany, the daughter of Eric Ismay, a British soldier, and Gerda Freitag, a German woman who worked at the British barracks. The family moved to the UK in 1952, but within a year Eric was posted to Korea as a UN peacekeeper, so Sue and her mother spent the next three years in the company of other German wives of British soldiers in a row of tin huts at the army barracks in Hampshire.<br /><br />The family moved house frequently as her father pursued his career. Sue went to seven different primary schools and quickly learned to change her accent as soon as she encountered her new classmates.<br /><br />In 1968, she went to the University of Essex, where she studied politics and Russian, subjects that helped feed her lifelong interest in leftwing, internationalist politics. After university, she moved to Manchester, where she started her teaching career, and married Tudor Owen in 1978. I was born later that year, followed by my two sisters, Rachel in 1980 and Siân in 1989. She gave the three of us a firm moral sense and a clear feminist outlook.<br /><br />She and Tudor were always hugely encouraging and supportive of their children’s ambitions, and, later, the source of irreplaceable help, advice, childcare and love when we had children of our own.<br /><br />After their retirement a decade ago, my parents threw themselves enthusiastically into language, history and art classes, volunteering for a refugee charity, travelling, spending time with their close-knit group of friends, and singing in local choirs. Sue loved to sing – especially Joni Mitchell songs, always adding her own improvisations to the melody.<br /><br />From 2015 to 2019 Sue and Tudor also cared for Sue’s elderly mother, and, after Gerda’s death, Sue organised a trip with other family members to find the site of the Freitag family farmhouse, once in Germany but now part of Poland. It was a powerful moment for Sue to locate its overgrown remains, along with the wooden church where her grandparents had got married and the town hall where her mother had worked at the start of the war.<br /><br />She loved the idea of living as far as possible in harmony with nature – as her mother’s family had done on their farm – and in recent years rewilded part of her garden for this reason. A voracious reader of books and the news, for over 50 years Sue would settle down at the dining table each evening to read the Guardian from cover to cover.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/dec/02/sue-owen-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I gambled on Ali getting a knockout, fastening my camera to the lights way above the ring. And Williams landed flat on his back in a good spot’</p><p>Everyone assumes the picture I took of <a href="https://aboutphotography.blog/blog/2020/1/20/ali-vs-liston">Ali v Liston in 1965</a> is my favourite – it has even been called the greatest sports photograph of all time. But my favourite photograph I ever took is Ali v Williams, no question about it. It’s the only one of my photographs hanging in my home. I’ve shot everything in my career, from Charles Manson to the pope, but I’ve never taken a better photograph than this.</p><p>I shot 35 of Ali’s fights. I was ringside for Sports Illustrated when he won the world title in Miami in 1964 and my photo for that made the cover, so by the time of the Cleveland Williams fight I was pretty well established. Williams was a very promising heavyweight but the underdog; the main thing I remember from that night was how excited I was about how I was going to shoot it. Putting a camera over the ring goes way back, maybe to Joe Louis’ days, certainly Sugar Ray Robinson. But the lights that lit up those fights were always 20-25ft over the ring and there was no lens wide enough to capture the whole scene; photographers used fisheye lenses so the ring never quite looked square.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/02/muhammad-ali-cleveland-williams-neil-leifers-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Natalie Palamides’s drag king show remains both raucous and subtle, as it explores grey areas around consent</p><p>There can be sacrifices when live comedy transfers to TV – and I expected them with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/22/can-you-do-comedy-about-natalie-palamides-thinks-so-edinburgh-best-newcomer">Natalie Palamides’ hot-button anarcho-clown show Nate</a>. But sometimes – it turns out – comedy can be <em>more</em> electrifying on screen. Yes, Nate was extraordinary first time around, when its bull-in-a-china-shop inquiry into gender and consent became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/aug/08/natalie-palamides-review-big-uneasy-laughs-in-fearless-times-up-comedy">the talk of Edinburgh 2018</a>. But at a fringe festival, its ingredients (nudity and cross-dressing; unstable audience interaction; giant rubber cocks) are par for the course. On Netflix, they feel like a major provocation.</p><p>Comparisons are already being made with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jul/16/hannah-gadsby-trauma-comedy-nanette-standup-netflix">Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette</a>, another fringe graduate that upended mainstream standup. Nate is so untoward, it comes with a pre-show warning from producer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/26/amy-poehler-one-must-try-to-be-a-good-citizen-at-this-time">Amy Poehler</a>. It’s not required: Palamides can soften you up and get you going without help. S/he begins with a swaggering two-minute burlesque on machismo, all shades, chest hair and heavy metal, playing the daredevil and chugging beers. It is gloriously ridiculous – but things soon get complicated. Nate asks for permission to grope people in the audience. He instructs us in the need to secure consent – while violently chopping wood, which sends a mixed signal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/02/nate-a-one-man-show-review-outrageous-and-electrifying-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Until theatre lovers can experience that alchemy on stage again, this initiative is one way to brighten up the month for those who can’t visit a venue</p><p>Never mind The Nutcracker – the most fun I had at the theatre last Christmas, in fact all last year, was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/dec/12/squirrel-review-under-5s-show-egg-theatre-bath">with a nut-hunting squirrel</a>. Staged in an attic space at the Egg theatre in Bath, Kate Cross and Tim Bell’s half-hour show for under-fives let loose a puppet rodent on a brilliant Bauhaus-style set. Everything about it worked. The young audience huddled together and played around actor-puppeteer Caroline Garland who told the story with them, not to them, and the sense of alchemy you feel in great theatre-making ended with a final flourish that still makes me smile.</p><p>This Christmas, of course, that sort of show just couldn’t be staged – although the Egg does have a couple of <a href="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/whats-on/?ven=11">socially distanced festive productions</a>. But what’s this? Squirrel is back and co-starring with the hero of one of the Egg’s past Christmas plays, Snow Mouse. The Egg is one of several UK theatres to have created an <a href="https://www.theatreroyal.org.uk/event/advent-calendar/">online advent calendar</a> to brighten up the month for kids who may not be able to visit a venue. It’s an inspired move, particularly as Christmas is the only time of the year that many families get to the theatre.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/02/cant-get-to-the-theatre-this-christmas-open-an-online-advent-calendar">Continue reading...</a>

Rather than studying human health in isolation, this approach considers how the health of people, animals and the environment are intimately related.

<p>How do bowlers deal with hitting batsmen? Which approach works best against speed? When do you turn to Paul McKenna?</p><p>By <a href="https://twitter.com/jimbo_cricket?lang=en">James Wallace</a> for <a href="https://wisden.com/wisden-cricket-monthly">Wisden Cricket Monthly</a></p><p>It will take you longer than 0.4 seconds to read this sentence. It will take your brain longer still to make sense of it. The fastest bowlers propel the ball at speeds in excess of 90mph. At the point of release, they are just shy of 19 metres away from their intended target. That’s if the intended target is the wooden stumps. A big if. The flesh and bone batsman, defending their stumps, body and pride (not necessarily in that order), is positioned around 17.5 metres away on the line of the popping crease. Some choose to take guard here; others retreat back towards their stumps in an attempt give themselves more time.</p><p>Because time is in short supply. Studies have shown that it takes a batsman 0.3 seconds to “react” − to process the line of the ball, make a judgment on its likely course and decide which stroke to play. It takes another 0.3 seconds for the limbs to receive the information from the brain and perform the shot. That’s 0.6 seconds in total – longer than 0.4 seconds, so something has to give. “Speed defeats reactions,” says former England fast bowler John Snow in <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Letting-Rip-Bowling-Threat-Lillee/dp/0854932429">Letting Rip</a>, Simon Wilde’s thrilling exploration of fast bowling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/02/raw-truth-about-fast-bowling-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pop’s mothers have told of guilt, loneliness and record-label prejudice – so do men face the same problems? Wayne Coyne, Tom Fletcher, Ghetts, Thurston Moore and others respond</p><p>This summer, two of the world’s biggest pop stars became parents for the first time. Katy Perry told an interviewer that after becoming pregnant, “a lot of people have asked me: are you going to go away?” Presumably, though, nobody has enquired if new dad Ed Sheeran will be exiting the music industry with immediate effect. Perhaps they should.</p><p>In recent years, female artists such as Perry – but rarely their male counterparts – have been speaking with increasing candour about the anxiety, guilt, unrealistic expectations and logistical nightmares involved in balancing parenthood and pop stardom. Paloma Faith said the toil of touring with a young baby made her ill, and that her record company assumed her sales would divebomb because “people wouldn’t find a mother as appealing”. In 2018, Cardi B cancelled a tour due to begin six weeks after the birth of her daughter, saying she had “underestimated this whole mommy thing”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/02/my-coolness-has-disintegrated-how-pop-stars-cope-with-fatherhood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From dancefloor divas to piano virtuosos, Jamie Windust, the memoirist and model, shares the listening experiences that helped groove and soothe them through this tumultuous year </p><p>I was perched on my doorstep around midnight, 29 May, chain smoking and repeatedly refreshing my Spotify app when a glorious moment of lightness and joy in the depths of lockdown blues popped up on my phone. Chromatica. She was here, and the little monster inside me was rebirthed as I sat there in the moonlight, ready to tap play on the opening track. Listening to each song, I was reminded of how precious Lady Gaga’s music has been to me during pivotal moments in my life, and here she was marking 2020 – a year that I, like you, will never forget. It’s unsurprising, then, to look at my 2020 Spotify Wrapped data and see that four of my top five tracks this year are from Chromatica. Some may call it a guilty pleasure, but I think life is too short to qualify joy.</p><p>Music has always held my hand and transported me to my own version of reality, blocking out the mundane and amplifying the fabulous. This year has been no different. It’s ironic that pop music has had such a moment in 2020, when we’ve been unable to make the most of it on the dancefloor. But, like Sophie Ellis-Bextor, I and many others turned our kitchens and living rooms into makeshift discotheques. Those moments of letting loose with wild abandon, even just momentarily, helped me escape the horrendous world outside and return to myself. I’ve kept feelings of isolation at bay this year by dancing in my underwear and running around my flat to Little Mix, one of my most played artists of 2020, or reenacting the music video to React by Pussycat Dolls – one of my most played tracks this year. True Bliss.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-sound-of-2020/2020/dec/02/guilt-free-lady-gaga-and-like-minded-friends-the-music-and-podcasts-that-got-me-through-2020">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What are we going to do when all our former comforts induce juddering flashbacks to lockdown? </p><p>I have already started practising my small talk for Christmas. “Good, thanks. You?” I keep saying into a mirror, fully aware that in the past eight months I have more or less completely lost the ability to make conversation with humans. “What did I do with the time? Wow, the year has gone so quickly, hasn’t it?”</p><p>At this point I pause meaningfully because I know I have about two minutes of material to stretch over a five-day festive period with fewer people than usual, so I really need to make it last. “Let’s see, umm … got really into jigsaws for a bit.

## ‘Listening to David Bowie reminded me of mum’: why we all turned to nostalgia to get through 2020

<p>In a year of such jarring change, it is perhaps no surprise that many of us have longed to turn the clocks back – but is there more to nostalgic listening than just a desire to remember the good times?</p><p>It’s natural to lean on things that comfort us during periods of grief, anxiety and uncertainty. And for many, with 2020 becoming synonymous with those very emotions, nostalgia has been the ultimate tonic to remedy the difficulties of this year. It seems intuitive then, that listening trends would be impacted by these universal feelings, as people opt for a dose of nostalgia, and turn to the music of prior decades for some semblance of solace among the chaos. While a glance at recent Spotify stats confirms this, we’ll all soon be able to take a deep dive into our own sounds of 2020 as <a href="https://www.spotify.com/uk/wrapped/" rel="nofollow">Spotify Wrapped</a> unveils the songs that have been getting us all through.</p><p>“Research has shown that nostalgia boosts key psychological resources that help us deal with challenging situations,” says Gary Christopher, senior lecturer and Ageing Well lead at the University of the West of England, in Bristol. “Because nostalgic memories generally involve others in our lives, their recall helps the individual feel more connected to other people. Nostalgic memories also make people more optimistic and give them a greater sense that their life is meaningful.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-sound-of-2020/2020/dec/02/listening-to-bowie-reminded-me-of-mum-why-weve-all-turned-to-nostalgia-to-get-through-2020">Continue reading...</a>

It would be another 15 minutes before the board showed 42, finally bringing his first Champions League start to an end and, exhausted, Jamal Musiala headed towards the bench where Hansi Flick was waiting with a big smile and a bigger slap on the back.</p><p>“This was a very nice night,” the Bayern manager said; one in which his team were introduced to a new feeling while everybody else was introduced to a new generation. For the first time in 15 Champions League games Bayern had not won but there was only optimism, Flick declaring himself “very, very happy”. A late Thomas Müller penalty earned a 1-1 draw against Atlético Madrid, who have not been beaten here in a year, and they had done it with an unfamiliar team.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/02/jamal-musiala-shines-for-bayern-munich-champions-league-atletico-madrid">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The traditional 2lb baking container isn’t just for using up fruit – you can create everything from paté to panna cotta</p><p>A traditional 2lb loaf tin does not weigh two pounds, nor does it cost £2 – even the cheapest model will set you back about £2.50. It is called that because it is designed to accommodate 2lb of bread dough – about 900g.</p><p>So, it is not a size, but a rough measure of capacity – any 2lb loaf tin will hold about 1.5l of water. The shape, however, will vary from tin to tin – some are broad and shallow, like a barge, others high-sided, like a removal van. But they all do the same job and they are all good for a lot more than a beginner’s lockdown loaf. Here are 17 uses for an ordinary loaf tin – and not one of them is banana bread. If you are still looking for ways to use up old bananas, you need to stop buying bananas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/02/17-delicious-loaf-tin-recipes-that-arent-banana-bread">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government’s ambiguous Covid advice has pushed decisions on to individuals. For all our sakes, safety must come first </p><ul><li>Prof Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh</li></ul><p>Few times of the year are as challenging or stressful for families and relationships as Christmas.

It’s both confusing to know what to do and clear that although the government has permitted us to do certain things, this doesn’t necessarily mean we <em>ought</em> to.</p><p>As a public health expert, I’ve repeatedly been asked what families should do over the holidays. I’m torn between giving people the emotionally reassuring and comforting answer they want to hear or sticking bluntly to the best scientific evidence we have about transmission and suppression.

<p>While the fourth series has come under fire for factual inaccuracy, it is just one of many series to reflect the royals long history of mythmaking</p><p>‘Let’s get it over with,” sighs Prince Philip as he reluctantly prepares to venture towards a crowd of adoring subjects. On the one hand, this moment in The Crown has the ring of truth: realistically, why would members of the royal family be enthusiastic about meeting yet another mob of curtsying, awestruck plebs? It must be tremendously boring. And yet, on the other hand, how dare they? Who pays their wages?</p><p>A few things have become clear during the fourth season of Peter Morgan’s Netflix epic. Firstly, it’s just as well The Crown isn’t on the BBC. Because if it was, the nation’s enraged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/01/the-crown-oliver-dowden-reality-culture-secretary-fiction">rightwing culture warriors</a> would have descended upon Broadcasting House and stormed it. Secondly, this is a portrait of managed decline. And finally, The Crown means The Queen. But Olivia Colman’s Elizabeth II is more Canute than Britannia – not ruling the waves but nobly, if eventually absurdly, trying to hold them back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/02/the-crown-has-slipped-how-the-netflix-epic-captures-our-relationship-with-the-royals">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former NFL player believes uncomfortable conversations are a way of bridging the racial divide. So he wrote a book about them</p><p>What’s in a name? Power, says Emmanuel Acho. Before he was a standout football player turned TV commentator, he was the Nigerian kid with the biblical name that had all the kids fumbling for something else to call him. At his predominately white private suburban high school, he was “Manny.” To a mostly black gridiron cohort at the University of Texas, where he’d distinguish himself at linebacker on a college football powerhouse, he became “Acho” to differentiate him from his older brother, who had the privilege of being called by his first name, Sam – and who, like him, would go on to have a career in the NFL. </p><p>In time, Acho found inside those locker room walls the kind of open and meaningful discussions about race and culture that most on the outside would rather not have. “The locker room is what our society needs to look like,” says Acho. “You have people of different races, different religions. But because you have a common goal of beating the opponent, you don’t care about everyone’s differences. What we haven’t yet realized [as a society] is our opponent is oppression. The opponent is hatred, systemic injustice.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/02/emmanuel-acho-uncomfortable-conversations-with-a-black-man-nfl">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The upset and worry of Covid are making many of us anxious. So how can you tell if you are just feeling down, or if it’s something more serious? Here are the signs to look out for</p><p>It was last week that Halina Rifai resigned from her job. It was a short-term contract she’d taken on about a month ago, working for a call centre, but it was stressful, and meant working long hours at home, leaving her unable to get outside much during the day. Last week, she woke in the middle of the night and had a panic attack. “And then the next morning, I just went: ‘No, that’s it, I’m going out.’” She went for a six-mile walk before work, felt much better, but also knew that she had to make a decision about work. “It’s at this point that I have to weigh up my mental health against finance, and I have to choose my mental health,” she says, though she acknowledges she is lucky that she has another job lined up for early next year.</p><p>Rifai, from Glasgow, works in the music industry during non-pandemic times, and also hosts a mental health podcast, <a href="https://www.asonichug.com/">A Sonic Hug</a>. At the age of 16, she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after growing up in an abusive home, and at 20, she was having panic attacks and had developed agoraphobia. She has had treatment, including long-term talking therapy, which finished earlier this year, but she has learned to manage it largely herself – making sure she watches out for any signs that she is sliding back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/02/the-mental-health-mot-how-to-check-if-your-pandemic-blues-are-a-cause-for-concern">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Tate Britain, London</strong><br />The artist has boldly reclaimed figurative oil painting and filled the gallery with the kind of contemporary art it normally shuns</p><p>Looking at Lynette Yiadom-Boakye’s painting No Such Luxury, I suddenly saw how much she has in common with the Belgian surrealist René Magritte. The work depicts a woman sitting at a table with a cup and saucer in front of her, gazing straight out. That seems simple but the longer you look, the stranger it becomes. Magritte portrayed himself in the same pose in his painting The Magician – except with four arms. Yiadom-Boakye’s canvas may seem, by comparison, a slice of real life. But it’s weirdly out of scale, a bit larger than life. The woman is a monument, her gaze mystical and far-seeing – a Buddha of suburbia.</p><p>Yet Yiadom-Boakye has a far deeper affinity with Magritte. She makes us believe in someone who does not exist. Everything about her pictures of people says “portrait”. But these are not portraits. They’re fictional creations, imagined characters. “Ceci n’est pas une pipe,” Magritte wrote beneath a painting of a pipe. Yiadom-Boakye’s exhibition could have been simply called “This is not a portrait.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/02/lynette-yiadom-boakye-fly-in-league-with-the-night-review-tate-britain">Continue reading...</a>

When the Guardian ran <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/feb/28/why-do-video-game-players-invert-the-controls">an article asking why a large minority of game players invert the Y axis on their controls</a> – meaning that they push their joypad’s thumb stick down to move upwards on the screen – the response was huge. Hundreds of comments vociferously arguing why axis inversion was the only way to navigate a game world, and hundreds more incredulously arguing the opposite.</p><p>The purpose of the article was to discover reasons for this dichotomy in visual perception. Was axis inversion just a habit picked up from playing flight simulators or did it point to fundamental differences in how people perceive themselves in virtual worlds? There was no conclusion, but the argument raged on Twitter for days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/dec/02/scientists-studying-why-gamers-invert-their-controls">Continue reading...</a>
