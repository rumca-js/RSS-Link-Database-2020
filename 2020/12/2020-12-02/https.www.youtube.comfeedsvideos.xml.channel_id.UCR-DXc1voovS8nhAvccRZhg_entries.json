But what does that mean?\n\nKubernetes will still run Docker images just fine, since Docker images conform to the OCI standard. But Kubernetes recommends using a more lightweight container runtime, like containerd, or CRI-O, to actually _run_ containers inside a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nSo don't fret, this change likely won't affect you no matter what tools you use, unless you regularly install new Kubernetes clusters and set up Docker with them. And in that case, it should be a simple fix\u2014install containerd instead of Docker on your Kubernetes nodes!\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oVDPf8zPS0", "date_published": "2020-12-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
