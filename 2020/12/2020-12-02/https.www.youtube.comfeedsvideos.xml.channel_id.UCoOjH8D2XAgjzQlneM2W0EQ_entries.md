What if I told you that in 3 months, you could grow a quarter of a century younger?
That’s what a recent scientific study resulted in
There hasn’t been much proof that blood transfusions work. That is where this new study comes to the rescue.
In this study - the cells of participants aged in reverse by the equivalent of a staggering 25 years with something much less invasive than blood transfusions
Most generally accepted ways to slow down aging today only slows your body down by a tiny bit - so 25 years backwards is major
The method that they used to achieve these results isn’t limited to the ultra wealthy

To understand how to cure aging, we first have to understand what causes aging.
Aging is one of those great mysteries in life that’s up there with how consciousness works - so there’s still much debate on what really causes aging
The ends of our chromosomes have what’s called telomeres
You can think of telomeres like the plastic ends on your shoelaces that keep them from fraying
And when your telomeres have been exhausted - that cell can’t divide anymore and it turns into a senescent cell
These zombie cells contribute to things like diabetes, heart disease, and more
This is what researchers at the Tel Aviv University were about to change - to not just slow down the shortening of your telomeres, but to actually regenerate telomeres to make them longer

Hyperbaric Oxygen Chambers are basically where you lay inside a tube that’s pressurized with 100% oxygen

They took 35 adults that were 64 or older and put them through 60 oxygen chamber sessions over the course of 3 months, at 5 sessions per week

Thanks to the oxygen chamber therapy, all the telomeres of these important cells grew by a significant amount, with some telomeres repairing nearly 40% of its length!
The same is true when researchers measured how many of those zombie senescent cells remained

For the first time, we’ve discovered that you can age your blood cells - backwards by 25 years

Should you do this yourself? It depends on how much money you have to throw around
But not all hope is lost if you’re not rolling in cash
As this technology gets more attention, as more people are interested in doing this kind of therapy, as the economies of scale go up - prices will go down

The dream of immortality is a far off one
But this is a step in the right direction
