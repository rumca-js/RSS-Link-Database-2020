Linux users have some weird sadism where they recommend noobs to try to do the most difficult things when first using Linux, as if it's normal to install a dozen virtual machines, run everything in Wine and a GPU passthrough. That's the perfect recipe to make your life miserable and it's better to help people to actually use Linux the way it's intended to be used!
