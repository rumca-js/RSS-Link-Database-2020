My relative called me the other night and said, "you won't believe it! Our city made it onto American television for 8 minutes! We are famous all over the world!". Now I was pretty excited, because the city I used to live in in China doesn't get much press, so this was pretty awesome. Then I looked it up, and it turns out, it's a scam to make Chinese people think that their city is famous, and has been spotlighted in the USA. I found out that if you search the same term, tons of Chinese cities come up with the same message. It's all a scam. Why am I not surprised.
