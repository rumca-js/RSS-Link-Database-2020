I Caught the Chinese Government Again", "description": "My relative called me the other night and said, \"you won't believe it! Our city made it onto American television for 8 minutes! We are famous all over the world!\". Now I was pretty excited, because the city I used to live in in China doesn't get much press, so this was pretty awesome. Then I looked it up, and it turns out, it's a scam to make Chinese people think that their city is famous, and has been spotlighted in the USA. I found out that if you search the same term, tons of Chinese cities come up with the same message. It's all a scam. Why am I not surprised.\n\nBitcoin - bc1qrvvga0c4kn69rlte47q0tzrhugn9pf426tqhvm\nETH -  0x456E5A9B875d4eF8DCb70eB1F7Fa376C520b206C\n\n\u25d8 Support me on Patreon for early release, and much more! http://www.patreon.com/laowhy86\n\u25d8 Or, if you prefer, Subscribestar - https://www.subscribestar.com/laowhy86\n\nCar channel - https://www.youtube.com/worthlesswhips\nADVChina - https://www.youtube.com/advchina\nSerpentZA - https://www.youtube.com/serpentza\nADVPodcasts - https://www.youtube.com/advpodcasts\n\n\u25d8 Donate and support this channel through Paypal http://paypal.me/cmilkrun\n\n\u25d8 OR Become a Sponsor on YouTube:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChvithwOECK5g_19TjldMKw/sponsor\n\n\u25d8 My TV show: Conquering Northern China:\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringnorthernchina\n\n\u25d8 Conquering Southern China\nhttps://vimeo.com/ondemand/conqueringsouthernchina\n\n\u25d8 Discount code for both shows: laowinning\n\n\u25d8 Join me every week for videos about China!
