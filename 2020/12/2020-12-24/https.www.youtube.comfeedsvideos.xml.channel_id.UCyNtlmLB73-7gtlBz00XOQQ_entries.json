His is way better and he put so much work into it.\n\nWe had a proper blizzard a couple days ago, so I just had to dig my car out from under over six inches of snow. And that's not like \"oh, we got six inches\" but it's kinda spread all around, this was six inches at the shallowest. It actually snapped my car's radio antenna. Anyway my arms feel like noodles from all the digging so I'm just going to wish you all happy New Year.\n\nWritten and performed by Dan Olson\n\nCrowdfunding: https://www.patreon.com/foldablehuman\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/FoldableHuman", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU5ZlOAvzAo", "date_published": "2020-12-24 20:31:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
