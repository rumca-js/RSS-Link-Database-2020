## Boris Johnson has 'got Brexit done'. With a deal that will please no one | Martin Kettle

<p>Britain leaves the EU with its sovereignty compromised, its economy weakened – and its leader walking a tightrope</p><p>Brexit was never fundamentally an economic project. It was always more about what it said on the ballot paper in 2016. Brexit was about ceasing to be a member of the European Union. Leavers understood that. Remainers, in contrast, still struggle with it. To a lot of remainers, Brexit had to be a proxy for something else: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/08/vote-leave-racism-brexit-uncivil-war-channel-4">anti-immigrant feeling</a>, maybe, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/05/brexit-theresa-may-economic-austerity-leave-voting">economic disempowerment</a>, or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/01/generation-nostalgia-britain-past-brexit-immigration">post-imperial nostalgia</a>. Those issues were not irrelevant to Brexit, but they were never the main point.</p><p>Leaving the EU was an emotionally charged political proposition, not an economic one. It was a desire rooted in a vision of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/oct/11/we-voted-brexit-keep-parliament-sovereign-wont-be-gagged">British sovereignty</a> richly marinaded in a heady mix of nostalgia and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/nov/16/brexit-paranoid-fantasy-fintan-otoole">bogus victimhood</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/09/brexit-grassroots-movement-elitist-takeover-2016-referendum">fanned by Britain’s media</a>, and which made the enormous error of confusing sovereignty with power. The reality of that error will come home to roost in the months and years ahead. But Brexit was never about the price of potatoes or cars. In the end, it wasn’t even about standing up for Britain’s one genuine shared diplomatic triumph of recent decades, the Northern Ireland peace agreement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/24/boris-johnson-brexit-deal-britain-eu-sovereignty-economy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister deserves no credit for avoiding a calamity that loomed so close because he had chosen to drive eagerly towards it</p><p>That it would be better to leave the European Union with a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/24/uk-eu-agree-brexit-trade-deal-agreement">deal than without one</a> has never been in doubt. Only irresponsible demagogues, delusional ideologues and maverick bluffers pretended that Britain should attempt to walk away from its most important strategic alliance with no partnership agreement. Sadly, Boris Johnson has played each of those roles. Through a combination of cynicism and recklessness, the prime minister took Britain to the brink of calamity, prepared to drop from a cliff edge and call it majestic flight. To what extent he was bluffing is a question that can now, thankfully, go unanswered because there is a deal.</p><p>The contents are not yet clear, and the proximity of the 31 December deadline leaves little time to absorb the character of the new arrangements, let alone scrutinise the detail. That is partly a function of Mr Johnson’s notorious tendency to equivocate, but it also reflects a certain tactical cunning. The prime minister does not <a href="https://www.theneweuropean.co.uk/brexit-news/westminster-news/house-of-commons-on-brexit-6869014">want this deal to be examined</a>. What can already be said with some certainty is that it prescribes an immediate downgrade for the UK economy. That is a function of leaving the single market and customs union, and those choices were baked into the negotiating mandate. Trade volumes will decrease. Supply chains will be disrupted. Jobs will be lost. Those are intrinsic features of the hard Brexit model mandated by Mr Johnson.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/24/the-guardian-view-on-a-brexit-deal-relief-that-leaves-a-bitter-taste">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We already know its contours: a barely-there treaty that will make trade harder and destroy jobs. Labour should oppose it</p><p>Boris Johnson always expected news of a deal to be greeted with jubilation. It was to be his moment of triumph after three decades of climbing to the summit of British politics by railing against Brussels. The rightwing press dutifully rallied. Even Nigel Farage declared: <a href="https://twitter.com/Nigel_Farage/status/1342056303661879297?s=20">“The war is over.”</a></p><p>But with Britain in a state of crisis because of the government’s botched response to the pandemic, most people will react with relief or perhaps indifference. For all the triumphalist claims of the Brexiters, the sunny uplands they told us to expect are no more than another cold, dark, wet winter’s day. The 11th-hour antics means there will be little scrutiny of a trade deal that could shape Britain’s economic destiny for a generation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/24/at-long-last-we-have-a-brexit-deal-and-its-as-bad-as-you-thought">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Up’s moving life story to the father-son parting of Onward, the animation powerhouse has never shirked from profound contemplation</p><p>There comes a time in the life of a writer, director and, perhaps, a company when the days shorten, the shadows lengthen and contemplating the inevitable must begin. The guy in the cloak with the retro lawn equipment can’t be ignored any longer: Death. In Pixar’s latest film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/oct/13/soul-review-pixars-rapturous-tale-of-a-jazz-nut-on-a-surreal-out-of-body-journey">Soul</a>, mortality springs itself with supreme bad timing on protagonist Joe Gardner, a New York jazzman about to play the gig of his life when he falls down a manhole. After 2017’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jan/18/coco-review-pixar-land-of-the-dead-animation">Coco</a> and this year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/06/onward-review-pixar-conjures-big-screen-adventure-with-wizard-quest-story">Onward</a>, this is Pixar’s third film about death in as many years. Is this fixation the Californian animation giant’s midlife crisis in multimillion-dollar CGI form?</p><p>Soul, directed by Pete Docter, is a classy offering with smart colouring-book metaphysics in the vein of his 2015 film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar">Inside Out</a>, as Joe attempts to escape the “Great Beyond” and return to his body, via the “Great Before”. This is the realm where nascent souls must find their spark – their animating passion in life – and are then dispatched to Earth. Visually drawing on Powell and Pressburger’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/08/matter-life-death-review-re-release-powell-pressburger-david-niven-fighter-pilot">A Matter of Life and Death</a>, broaching the dark subject for children with life-affirming insouciance, and – featuring the company’s first black lead character – a big diversity coup, it’s a typically slick, four-quadrant-pleasing, stock price-boosting entertainment package.

<p>It sounds perverse, but for some of us the twin disasters have strengthened the bond we feel with our new home</p><p>Mutant-Covid, pre-Brexit Christmas seems like a cruel but fitting ending to a year that has seen a reckoning with mortality and extreme limitations on travel. This year has forced many of us from EU countries living in Britain to consider what it means to “belong”. After news of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/20/belgium-italy-and-netherlands-ban-flights-from-uk-over-new-covid-strain">border closures</a> streamed in over the weekend, my friend Rob was contemplating making it back to Ireland for Christmas through Northern Ireland, then reconsidered. Another friend had come back from Berlin to quarantine before seeing her father, who had been ill last year. After the tier 4 announcement she booked her return flights to Berlin and left six hours later without seeing her dad.</p><p>Of course, some fled back to their countries of origin during earlier stages of the pandemic, or had left for Christmas already, or hastened to get out ahead of the mutant virus. But for those of us who stayed – and are now receiving concerned and pitying messages from our friends and families in Europe – there remains a grim determination to double down on our commitment to the place we’ve chosen as a home in the UK – in my case London.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/24/covid-brexit-christmas-european-uk">Continue reading...</a>

Both successes were a long time coming, but sparked a ray of hope that the Black Lives Matter movement may be creating space for new voices and stories. The novelist, playwright and poet Bernardine Evaristo, who made history with Girl, Woman, Other, and Reni Eddo-Lodge, the groundbreaking author of Why I’m No Longer Talking to White People About Race, talk about this unprecedented moment.</em></p><p><strong>Bernardine Evaristo</strong>: This year, everything came to me. Absolutely everything. At times, it was quite overwhelming but I also welcomed it. Because I have been in this game for 40 years now. So to suddenly break through has been a great opportunity to use my platform in all the ways that one can. And then, of course, we had Black Lives Matter and the murder of George Floyd. Attention had been on my book anyway, because it had been doing really well. But the Black Lives Matter movement encouraged people to start reading books by writers of colour. You had all these book lists circulating on social media. Black authors were topping the charts. That’s never happened before.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/24/this-has-never-happened-before-bernardine-evaristo-and-reni-eddo-lodge-on-their-history-making-year">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The big cat campaigner reflects on her TV of the year, starring in the reality show that lit up lockdown – and what she did next </p><p><strong>Besides Tiger King, what was your favourite TV show of </strong><strong>the year? <br /></strong>Dancing With the Stars has become my favourite show of 2020. I’d never seen it before they called and asked me to participate [Baskin was a contestant on the latest series of the US reality series in September]. Now that I’ve been part of the DWTS family, I just delight in seeing the stars, the pros, and the results of all the people behind the scenes in each new routine. I know how hard each of them worked to entertain us all during this unprecedented time of uncertainty and I love them for it.</p><p><strong>Did you watch</strong><strong> anything over lockdown </strong><strong>that caught your attention</strong><strong>? <br /></strong>I typically work seven days a week from about 7.30am until 7.30 or 8pm. At the end of the day, I may turn on the TV while I exercise, or while I collapse, cat-atonic, on the couch, but five minutes after turning off the TV, I couldn’t tell you what I just watched. I watch TV more for the distraction of the shows to slow the to-do list that is rolling over in my head.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/24/tiger-king-carole-baskin-it-was-pitched-as-a-feud-between-two-crazy-people">Continue reading...</a>

The meditation retreat, as you would imagine, was pretty relaxed and the resident monk and I got along very well. Oita is famous for its fugu – the poisonous puffer fish – and for Christmas dinner, I took the only other person at the retreat and the monk into the city for a fugu feast. After a visit to a karaoke bar where we sang I Will Survive, the three of us rounded our Christmas off at a whisky bar before riding the train back to the temple to meditate before bed.

This might have seemed like the year of the writer, because cabin fever, economic precariousness and a climate of dystopia are staples for the profession. It might have been the year of the reader, as the desultory days of furlough and confinement allowed for more leisure activity. Certainly, ebook and classics sales are up.</p><p>A lot has been asked of literature in 2020. What do we need during hard, uncertain, even barricaded times? Escape? Comfort? A better vision of the world or a mirror of our malaise?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/24/this-christmas-read-a-story-aloud-youll-be-surprised-by-the-joy-it-brings">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘We had to watch the funeral from the side of the road’: Ruth Newman, died aged 74, of Covid-19

<p>A Welsh homemaker, she was admitted to hospital for a heart bypass and may have caught the virus there</p><ul><li>Read more stories from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/series/lost-to-the-virus">Lost to the virus series</a></li></ul><p>Ruth Newman had a lot of heartbreak in her life, but also a lot of happiness. The happiness: she married her husband, Adrian, a process worker, in 1966 – it would have been their 54th wedding anniversary this October. The heartbreak: their daughter, Rachel, died of a brain tumour when she was three. After Rachel died, they had a son, Gary, now 42. “She was very protective of me,” says Gary, a university admin worker. “Because of Rachel. She’d tell me to wrap up constantly. She was always worried about me, even when I was an adult.”</p><p>Ruth liked to bake jam buns or Victoria sponges. She would do the weekly shop with Adrian and then have lunch in the cafe at Morrisons. They ate out twice a week, at the local Harvester or a pub. She read murder mysteries and romance novels. An odd quirk: Ruth hated the colour green and would not allow anything green in the house, except for plants. “She thought it was unlucky,” says Gary. “She’d had a green car and it had caused her no end of bother.” The house was full of ornaments of cats. “She was cat mad,” observes Gary, drily. “I’m looking at a cat ornament right now.” (He has been shielding with his father since March – both men have underlying health issues.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/24/we-had-to-watch-the-funeral-from-the-side-of-the-road-ruth-newman-died-aged-74-of-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

## Starmer has set out his Scotland strategy. But it's not really about devolution | Rory Scothorne

<p>The Labour leader wants to convince Scotland’s ‘squeezed middle’ that he can get everything back under control</p><p>Engraved on the threshold of the Donald Dewar room in the Scottish parliament is a quote from the Labour party intellectual and MP John Pitcairn Mackintosh: “People in Scotland want a degree of government for themselves. It is not beyond the wit of man to devise institutions to meet those demands.” Few are fortunate enough to be cited so prominently within a gigantic vindication of their argument, but Mackintosh’s early support (he was first elected to parliament in 1966) for political devolution made him a rather isolated figure, especially among his Scottish colleagues in Labour. Where they saw devolution as a form of pandering to territorial grievances, Mackintosh saw an opportunity to relegitimise British politics by handing down power from the centre. The contemporary relevance of his ideas was asserted this week by Keir Starmer, who used the annual JP Mackintosh memorial lecture as a launchpad for his proposals to “win power, and then push as much power as possible away from Westminster”.</p><p>Mackintosh died in 1978, aged just 48, as a new generation of Labour MPs in Scotland – people such as Gordon Brown and Donald Dewar – were stepping into the constitutional breach created by the explosive arrival of the SNP to the political mainstream. Labour’s “New Scots” saw devolution as an essential way of steadying the tortured state they hoped to inherit. In 1980, Brown argued that “devolution must be taken out of the relatively restricting confines of Scotland and Wales and seen as part of the attempt to make British government more acceptable to the British people”. The former prime minister is now Starmer’s choice to lead a new, UK-wide “constitutional commission”, tasked with working out all the details of Labour’s new constitutional horizon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/24/keir-starmer-scotland-strategy-devolution-labour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Saba Sahar, who returned fire while protecting her daughter, survived one of a wave of recent assassination attempts that have killed six policewomen</p><p>It was just after 7am when the car carrying Colonel Saba Sahar, one of Afghanistan’s most senior female police officers, came under fire from armed insurgents. In the back seat, Sahar’s four-year-old daughter began screaming as bullets shattered the windscreen and ripped into the upholstery. As she pushed her child under the seat in front of her, Sahar saw three men carrying AK-47 assault rifles, firing as they approached the car.</p><p>In the front of the car her bodyguard and driver had both been hit and were badly injured and unconscious. Looking down, Sahar saw blood seeping through her clothing. “It took me another moment to realise I’d been shot too,” she says. She knew that she only had minutes to try to save her daughter. “They were five or six metres away, and they were moving closer to the car, still firing. They would have killed my child,” she says. Bleeding heavily from five shots to her stomach, Sahar reached forward, grabbed the gun from her slumped bodyguard and started returning fire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/dec/24/i-am-not-afraid-to-fight-the-female-afghan-colonel-who-survived-the-talibans-assassins">Continue reading...</a>

Disney-owned Lucasfilm currently has a problem on its hands, one that Hamill and an army of CGI technicians are more than ready to handle: Star Wars fans can’t wait for the umpteen new TV shows that are due to spin off from The Mandalorian. Efforts based on Obi-Wan Kenobi’s middle years, Boba Fett’s later period and Ahsoka Tano’s post Clone Wars antics are perhaps the most heavily anticipated – but there is very little interest in more Skywalker clan-linked efforts of the kind that fuelled the space opera saga for nine movies after JJ Abrams inadvertently Death Starred the entire franchise last time out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/24/luke-skywalker-the-mandalorian-new-mark-hamill-led-star-wars-movies">Continue reading...</a>

## Why Provence’s pompe à l’huile means Christmas to me  – plus the recipe

<p>A wonderful bread that used to be made by dumping flour into the olive mill to soak up the oil is a vital part of Christmas in rural south-east France</p><p>We lived in rural Provence for almost a decade and every Christmas Eve gradually reduced our consumption of imported mince pies, brandy snaps and liqueur-filled chocolates, replacing them with the Provençal tradition of <em>Le Gros Souper</em>. Despite its name, the meal is a display of restraint before the Christmas celebrations begin. It starts with a cleansing soup, <em>aïgo boulido</em>, boiled water with floating garlic slices, bay and sage leaves and a dash of olive oil. It’s surprisingly popular with my children, who drink it between chocolates and before the fish course, which is a salt cod and potato gratin served with courgettes, broccoli, anchovy paste, a boiled egg and aïoli sauce.</p><p>The fish needs soaking the day before in a milk bath. Abiding by tradition, we have three candles and three tablecloths (the Holy Trinity) and a large cloth to cover the buffet and desserts. Leftovers are not cleared away but remain on the table for any departed ancestors. This also makes the rush to midnight mass easier – France’s 8pm curfew is lifted only on Christmas Eve this year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/dec/24/why-provence-pompe-a-lhuile-means-christmas-to-me-plus-the-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

It was nice to watch something that was so divorced from the horrors of reality.’ Ammar also discusses why Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You and Steve McQueen’s Small Axe series are both such standout pieces of work. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/24/culture-2020-a-look-back-at-the-best-tv-music-and-books-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
