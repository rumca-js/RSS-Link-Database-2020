Prof Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London

I think the greatest concern of ours at the moment is the South African one

There's certainly anecdotal reports of explosive outbreaks for that virus and very steep increases in case numbers

Mr Hancock

New variant was highly concerning

Anyone told to quarantine must avoid all contact with any other person whatsoever

Prof Lawrence Young, Warwick Medical School

The move to harsher levels of restriction across the country is inevitable

Alan Winde, Western Cape

Hospitals in the province under severe strain

More Covid-19 cases than during the first wave

2020 12

Estimated transmissibility and severity of novel SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 in England 

Centre for Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine 

https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/reports/uk-novel-variant/2020_12_23_Transmissibility_and_severity_of_VOC_202012_01_in_England.pdf

Appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation

VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible 

95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%

No clear evidence for greater or lesser severity of disease

Increase in transmissibility, a large increase in incidence

COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020

Even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained

Unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed

Large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures

Greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden

Old tiering system was not enough to control the new variant
