This video was recorded on 12/8/2020.

Hank and our content manager, Alexis, interviewed Dr. Howard Bauchner, the Editor in Chief of the JAMA network of medical journals. They discussed some of the surprising things that we've learned since the beginning of the pandemic and how we should approach vaccine hesitancy.
