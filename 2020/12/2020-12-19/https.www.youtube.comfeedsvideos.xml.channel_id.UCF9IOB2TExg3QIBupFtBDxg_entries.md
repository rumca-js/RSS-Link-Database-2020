Covid-19: New coronavirus variant is identified in UK

https://www.bmj.com

https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4857

Driving infections in the south east

What do we know?

VUI-202012/01

Variant Under Investigation

Defined by a set of 17 mutations

Most significant is an N501Y mutation

Spike protein

More infectious

How was the variant detected?

Genomics UK

Public health agencies, Wellcome Sanger Institute, 12 academic institutions

Random genetic sequencing of positive samples around the UK

Set up in April 2020, sequenced 140,000 virus genomes

Uses the data to track outbreaks, identify variant viruses, publish old weekly report 

https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/

How common is it?

As of 13 December

1,108, 60 different local authorities

Sunday, 20th 60% of new cases in London

South east of England, Scotland

Seeded every part of Wales

Netherlands, Italy, Austria, Belgium flight ban, Eurostar to Belgium

France and Germany expected soon

First spotted in late September

Now 20% of viruses sequenced in Norfolk

Essex 10%

Suffolk 3%

No data to suggest it’s imported

Does this variant spread more quickly?

Initially it was a correlation

Up to 70% more infectious

Raising R value by 0.4

Is the new variant more dangerous?

Porton Down

Will the vaccine still work?

May have an effect on neutralising antibodies

## Excellent vaccine news

Pfizer progress

400 GPs, 83 hospitals

Half a million so far

200,000 a day should be receiving jabs, well over one million a week by Christmas

Pfizer orders

50 million doses by end of 2020

US, 100 – 500 million doses

EU, 200 million doses

UK, 40 million doses

EMA, Monday 21st December

Moderna

FDA grants emergency approval

Six million doses ready to go

The end begins just after Christmas

Approved within days of Christmas

Senior Whitehall sources

Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA)

28 or 29 December

Final data provided to the regulator on Monday 21st December

Four million doses ready

Football stadia, racecourses, conference centres, pharmacies

First week of January

Several million doses a week

UK, 100 million doses (80 million produced in UK)

India, 50 million doses in stock

First batch of four million doses, Netherlands and Germany

AstraZeneca has 15 million doses of active ingredients ready, filled into vials in days

Two doses, 4 week gap

Leaving an adequate gap between doses is the most crucial way to boost efficacy

Oxford AstraZeneca orders

EU, 400 million doses

UK, 100 million

US, 300 million

China, 200 million

Japan, 120 million

Brazil, 100 million

Indonesia, 100 million

Australia, 33.6 million

Egypt 30 million

Argentina 32 million

Canada 20 million

Argentina and Mexico to produce for Latin America

Vaccines alliance for poorer countries, 300 million

Three billion does in 2021

Phase 1/2 trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a booster dose induces multifunctional antibody responses, (Nature Medicine, 17th December)

Viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01179-4

190 vaccines currently in development

Neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein correlate with protection

Additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection

Two jabs, 56 days apart

SD/SD  n = 20

SD/LD n = 32

A booster dose is safe and better tolerated than priming doses

After second dose

Increased anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers,

Increased cell mediated immunity

Increased neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis

Increased complement activation

Increased natural killer cell activation

SD / SD

Stronger antibody responses

T cell responses did not increase with either booster dose

These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials
