The Acid Rain Maestro is a six-channel cv modulation module for your eurorack system. It can create complex chains of timed modulation, mute and unmute individual tracks or full tracks, save and load banks. It's super performative and quick to respond and absolutely has the ability to be the conductor of your entire eurorack system. In this video, we'll walk through how it works. You can watch all my musical experiments so far with the Maestro here: https://youtu.be/6uxPbObwsjQ

Grab the Maestro wherever good eurorack stuff is sold.
