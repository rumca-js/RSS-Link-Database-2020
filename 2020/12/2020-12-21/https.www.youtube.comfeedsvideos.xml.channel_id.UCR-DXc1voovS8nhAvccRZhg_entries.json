MORE THAN 1 Gbps!", "description": "The Raspberry Pi has built in 802.11ac WiFi. But it's not that fast. Let's see what we can do about that!\n\nI tried getting both an ASUS AC51 and Intel AX200 PCI express card working on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. How did that work out? Check out this video to see the story of how I blew through my budget and spent over a month testing WiFi on the CM4!\n\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\n\nProducts I used (affiliate links):\n\n  - ASUS RT-AX86U WiFi 6 Router: https://amzn.to/3re0KDy\n  - EDUP PCIe 1x Intel AX200 Card: https://amzn.to/3ar3Pu3\n  - Wise Tiger AX200 Mini PCIe Card (for Dell XPS 13): https://amzn.to/3an2a8O\n\nMentioned in this episode:\n\n  - ASUS AC51 failure: https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/20\n  - Mac VM-based cross-compile environment: https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/tree/master/extras/cross-compile\n  - How to upgrade Dell XPS 13 to WiFi 6: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C760v9XpkzE\n  - Pronunciation of 'ASUS': https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjjoGtXV6pY\n  - Set up Merlin firmware and iperf on ASUS RR-AX86U: https://github.com/geerlingguy/raspberry-pi-pcie-devices/issues/22#issuecomment-748534025\n\n#RaspberryPi #ComputeModule4 #WiFi6\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - WiFi 6 on the Pi\n00:53 - ASUS AC51 802.11ac card\n01:12 - Upgrade to 10 Gigs?\n01:58 - WiFi standards and AX\n03:19 - EDUP Intel AX200 card\n04:19 - Cross-compiling Linux with iwlwifi\n08:14 - iwlwifi Intel firmware\n09:55 - Patching Intel's driver\n11:51 - Testing the iwlwifi patch\n12:53 - Benchmarking 802.11ax\n14:45 - Blowing through my Budget to test AX\n15:53 - iperf benchmark results\n16:50 - WiFi lessons learned\n17:27 - Petition and Bloopers", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csI19aOJEik", "date_published": "2020-12-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
