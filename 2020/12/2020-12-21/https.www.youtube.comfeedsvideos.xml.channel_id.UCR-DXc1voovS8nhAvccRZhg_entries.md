The Raspberry Pi has built in 802.11ac WiFi. But it's not that fast. Let's see what we can do about that!

I tried getting both an ASUS AC51 and Intel AX200 PCI express card working on the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4. How did that work out? Check out this video to see the story of how I blew through my budget and spent over a month testing WiFi on the CM4!
