Billy has visited our studio a handful of times, but we only have a couple videos to share. The first is from deep in our archives: Bragg's performance of \"Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards\" from SXSW 2008, which begins with a bit of Bragg's signature banter. Next, we have a more recent performance, a 2016 duo with Joe Henry from Bragg and Henry's collaborative album, \"Shine A Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad.\" Happy birthday, Billy Bragg, and we hope to see you again before too long.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards\" (2008)\n5:16 \"Railroad Bill\" (2016, with Joe Henry)\n\nPERSONNEL\nBilly Bragg \u2013 vocals, guitar\nJoe Henry \u2013 vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Bo Hakala; Micheal Wells; Leah Garaas\nAudio: Michael Wells; Michael DeMark; Jalen Russell\nProduction: Michael Wells; Ali Lozoff; Derrick Stevens; Mike Pengra\n\nFIND MORE:\n2008 performance at SXSW: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2008/03/15/billy_bragg_performs_live_from_sxsw\n2010 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2010/09/10/billy-bragg\n2013 Theft of the Dial: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/04/billy-bragg-totd\n2016 studio session with Joe Henry:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/10/20/billy-bragg-and-joe-henry-put-down-railroad-tracks-in-the-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#billybragg", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UuRaiVWWzg", "date_published": "2020-12-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Nilufer Yanya - Virtual Session", "description": "Nil\u00fcfer Yanya joins Sean McPherson to play songs from her new EP, Feeling Lucky? which was released earlier this month.
