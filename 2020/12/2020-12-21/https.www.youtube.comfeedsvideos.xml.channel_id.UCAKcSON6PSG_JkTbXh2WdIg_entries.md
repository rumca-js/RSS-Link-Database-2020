Sunday, Dec. 20, was the birthday of Billy Bragg! Billy has visited our studio a handful of times, but we only have a couple videos to share. The first is from deep in our archives: Bragg's performance of "Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards" from SXSW 2008, which begins with a bit of Bragg's signature banter. Next, we have a more recent performance, a 2016 duo with Joe Henry from Bragg and Henry's collaborative album, "Shine A Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad." Happy birthday, Billy Bragg, and we hope to see you again before too long.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards" (2008)
5:16 "Railroad Bill" (2016, with Joe Henry)
