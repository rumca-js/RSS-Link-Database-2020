The Apple AirPods Max have been released to much fanfare. At a colossal $550, it puts itself way above the competition like the very popular Sony WH-1000XM4, Bowers & Wilkins PX7, and the Bose 700; however, it's still a bit shy of what the hi-fi market would expect in terms of pricing. Are they good? Yes. Quite good, in fact. But are they good enough to warrant their price tag? Watch our comprehensive AirPods Max review to find out.
