Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nDec. 7, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- The Austin-based rock band Black Pumas is having a good 2020. The group, led by singer Eric Burton and guitarist Adrian Quesada, was just nominated for three Grammys, including album of the year for Black Pumas (Deluxe Edition), and both record of the year and best American roots performance for the track \"Colors.\" The band's turn behind a tiny desk (and chair) shows why its debut album \u2014 now more than a year old \u2014 is receiving so much recognition right now.\n\nBlack Pumas' gritty, retro-soul groove is on full display, while the intensity level builds gradually throughout this four-song set. It's clear why the band's live shows have won over fans. From the opening strains of \"Red Rover,\" Burton digs deep and by the time we get to the ballad \"OCT 33,\" he's burning with old-school soul heartbreak.\n\nQuesada's guitar is the perfect call-and-response foil, while the entire band \u2014 complete with two powerful back-up singers \u2014 calls to mind soul classics, but with a groovy new sheen.\n\nI've seen some of Black Pumas' shows in recent years and the band gets better every time out. The power of this Tiny Desk (home) concert shows that they always bring it, no matter the size of the audience.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Red Rover\"\n\"Fire\"\n\"OCT 33\"\n\"Colors\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nEric Burton: vocals, guitar\nAdrian Quesada: guitar\nLauren Cervantes: vocals\nAngela Miller: vocals\nJaRon Marshall: keys\nBrendan Bond: bass\nSteve Bidwell: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Amos David McKay / TWO HEADED BOY\nAudio: Aaron Glemboski\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Felix Contreras\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Bolien, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKfRm6uNx7I", "date_published": "2020-12-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
