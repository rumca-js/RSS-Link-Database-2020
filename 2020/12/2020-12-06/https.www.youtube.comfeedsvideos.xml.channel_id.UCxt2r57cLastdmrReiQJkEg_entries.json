In particular, I consider what we might learn about how shitposting works and what its appeal is through comparing it to some historical predecessors from music and art history.\n\nWe'll be looking at the work of Marcel Duchamp, Dada and the experimental composer John Cage to consider what their work might have in common with Pepe the Frog, Dat Boi and Simpsonwave.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com/\n\n#internetculture #art #tomnicholas", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmzyGNXxwdo", "date_published": "2020-12-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
