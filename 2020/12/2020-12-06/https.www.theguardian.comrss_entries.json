A regular on CNN over the past decade, Jones trained as a lawyer at Yale and has spent more than 25 years fighting for criminal justice reform.

Jones, who is 52 and was born in Tennessee, lives in Los Angeles and has two sons with his ex-wife Jana Carter.</p><p><strong>Tell me about the lead-up to that CNN speech and the state of your nerves.<br /></strong>We were all just exhausted. We had been doing 17-hour days, for five days. We knew that it was going to be a long, slow count, but that doesn\u2019t mean that your body and heart and soul can endure it with perfect equipoise. When it was finally called, my phone started blowing up with text messages from Muslim friends, friends from immigrant communities. One guy said, \u201cI\u2019m not crying, you\u2019re crying,\u201d just as a little a joke about how emotional everybody was. And it just hit me what a burden we\u2019ve all been carrying, especially people who are in harm\u2019s way of the president\u2019s rhetoric. When they switched over to our panel, and Anderson [Cooper] asked me how I was doing, I couldn\u2019t see my notes \u2013 you see me looking down trying to read them but my eyes are full of tears.
