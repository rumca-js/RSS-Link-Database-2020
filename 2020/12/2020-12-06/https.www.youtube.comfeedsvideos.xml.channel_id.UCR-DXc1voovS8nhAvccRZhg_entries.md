The Pi 4 now has an official Case Fan. How well does it work? Is it loud?

I'll answer those questions in this video. You can buy the Case Fan from your favorite Pi supplierâ€”or do what I recommend and buy a silent heatsink case, like the Flirc! Go here to get one on Amazon: https://amzn.to/37EkjMj
