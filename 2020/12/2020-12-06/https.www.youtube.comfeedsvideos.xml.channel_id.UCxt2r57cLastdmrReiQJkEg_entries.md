In this month's video, I (Tom Nicholas), take a look at shitposting. In particular, I consider what we might learn about how shitposting works and what its appeal is through comparing it to some historical predecessors from music and art history.

We'll be looking at the work of Marcel Duchamp, Dada and the experimental composer John Cage to consider what their work might have in common with Pepe the Frog, Dat Boi and Simpsonwave.
