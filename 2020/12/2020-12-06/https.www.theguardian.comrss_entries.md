He played alongside Michael Jordan for the Chicago Bulls when they dominated the sport in the 1990s, winning six NBA championships. (He also won two Olympic gold medals.)

<p>Harry Kane to Son Heung-min: goal. Son to Kane: game over. The most lethal double act in the Premier League were at it again, combining to give Tottenham a 2-0 lead by half-time and the platform for a comfortable return to the top of the table.</p><p>The numbers alone are worth highlighting. Kane has now scored 14 goals and made 12 assists in all competitions this season, while for Son it is 13 goals and six assists. The pair have built an instinctive understanding and it was stamped all over the second goal in particular, Kane bending his run around Son on a rapid break before accepting the pass and blasting high past Bernd Leno.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/06/tottenham-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This is an achievement that answers one big scientific question but raises more fundamental ones for society<br /></p><p>Has one of the most important questions of science now <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03348-4" title="">been answered</a>? From the headlines you might think so. For some biology’s “<a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/deepmind-finds-biology-s-holy-grail-with-answer-to-protein-problem-htg6s7qlq" title="">holy grail</a>” had been found.

On the surface the news seemed rather mundane. Google’s artificial intelligence company DeepMind <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/30/deepmind-ai-cracks-50-year-old-problem-of-biology-research" title="">won</a> an international competition that asked entrants to predict how proteins fold in three dimensions given only the sequences of their chemical links, or amino acids.</p><p>Set up in 1994, progress in the “Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction” (<a href="https://predictioncenter.org/index.cgi" title="">CASP</a>) race had almost come to a halt. Many in the field had given up hope they would live to see a solution. However, in 2018 DeepMind had won the “protein Olympics” by some distance. This year its AlphaFold2 software lapped the opposition. While it was a great leap for CASP, it seemed a small step for humanity. DeepMind <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/deepmind-ai-speeds-up-the-time-to-determine-proteins-structures-68221" title="">trained</a> a neural network on protein-structure databases to learn what proteins look like. It did so by rapidly learning what evolutionary adaptations had occurred over millennia and using those insights in its guesses.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/06/the-guardian-view-on-deepminds-brain-the-shape-of-things-to-come">Continue reading...</a>

A regular on CNN over the past decade, Jones trained as a lawyer at Yale and has spent more than 25 years fighting for criminal justice reform. A special adviser for green jobs in the early days of the Obama administration, he crossed party lines to work with the Trump administration in 2018, helping to draft the First Step Act and drawing criticism from fellow progressives in the process. Jones, who is 52 and was born in Tennessee, lives in Los Angeles and has two sons with his ex-wife Jana Carter.</p><p><strong>Tell me about the lead-up to that CNN speech and the state of your nerves.<br /></strong>We were all just exhausted. We had been doing 17-hour days, for five days. We knew that it was going to be a long, slow count, but that doesn’t mean that your body and heart and soul can endure it with perfect equipoise. When it was finally called, my phone started blowing up with text messages from Muslim friends, friends from immigrant communities. One guy said, “I’m not crying, you’re crying,” just as a little a joke about how emotional everybody was. And it just hit me what a burden we’ve all been carrying, especially people who are in harm’s way of the president’s rhetoric. When they switched over to our panel, and Anderson [Cooper] asked me how I was doing, I couldn’t see my notes – you see me looking down trying to read them but my eyes are full of tears. So I just started free associating. I just had to speak from the heart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/van-jones-cnn-faces-of-2020-joe-biden-romantic-idealist">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They grew up in a ‘nowhere’ suburb in the 70s, smoking skunk, going for rides and dating girls. The photographer reveals why he decided to capture the ravages of time on his old childhood gang</p><p>Rick Schatzberg had a dark epiphany a few years back, when two of his friends died in quick succession, one from a heart attack, the other from an overdose. “When two people you know and love die within six weeks of each other,” says the photographer quietly, “you realise that death is not just something that happens to other people, to the unlucky people. It’s something that is suddenly very present.”</p><p>Schatzberg’s response was to undertake a project about encroaching mortality – his friends’ and by extension his own. The result, several years in the making, is The Boys, a photobook that is both nostalgic and brutally realistic: a visual evocation of youth in all its instinctive carefreeness; and old age in all its debilitating inevitability. Composed of casual colour snapshots of his male friends in the 1970s, and large-format contemporary portraits of their ageing bodies, it lays bare what the novelist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/14/hotels-of-north-america-rick-moody-review-novel">Rick Moody</a>, in his accompanying essay, calls “the sobering action of time”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/06/rick-schatzberg-shot-his-old-friends-topless-the-boys">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aside from abuse hurled at the London Eye, this livestreamed boat gig is a sedate pootle through his solo work and the heavier end of Oasis</p><p>Other livestreams have sold themselves on everything from dazzling displays of the latest technology or promises they could somehow recreate the atmosphere of a club, but – not entirely unpredictably – Liam Gallagher’s offers up allusions to rock history. It comes advertised with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/oct/18/jamie-reid-sex-pistols-artist-interview-pussy-riot">Jamie Reid</a> ransom-note graphics and a cartoon that apes the poster displayed outside cinemas when The Great Rock ’n’ Roll Swindle was showing: the obvious inference is that it’s an event spiritually akin to the Sex Pistols’ infamously chaotic July 1977 performance on a River Thames pleasure cruiser, which ended prematurely with police boarding the boat, scuffles and multiple arrests.</p><p>Of course, the reality of Down by the River Thames is absolutely nothing like that. Filmed a month ago, its footage of passing landmarks and the London skyline illuminated at dusk is so beautifully shot and edited, it could be an advert for Visit Britain. The closest it comes to authority-baiting insurrectionary fervour is when Our Kid unaccountably takes against the sight of the London Eye between songs. “Arsed about you, big wheel,” he bellows, curiously. “Big round daft thing sitting there all lit up. I couldn’t give less of a fuck about you.” On another occasion, he’s momentarily distracted by another denizen of the river. “This one’s for all the beautiful people on Earth,” he begins, before something catches his eye: “CANOE!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/06/liam-gallagher-down-by-the-river-thames-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Back pain has become rife in lockdown. But that’s not the only reason chiropractors are being hailed as YouTube influencers – there’s a horror movie thrill, too<br /></p><p>The man in a waistcoat and jeans stands over a woman who lies face-down on a vinyl bed.

Click, crack: her neck twists in a way that necks don’t usually like to be twisted. The woman curses in apparent relief; the man laughs. He is Joseph Cipriano, a chiropractor who is also known as Dr Joe Back Crack or the Y Strap Doc (after his trademark treatment tool) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg-0cIXZBoM&amp;t=761s">this video of him adjusting a client</a> with “*EXTREMELY LOUD* chiropractic cracking” has been viewed 19m times.</p><p><a href="https://www.drjoebackcrack.com/">Cipriano</a>, who has 1.6 million subscribers on YouTube and his own range of “Team Y Strap” and “Make Your Spine Great Again” sweatshirts, is one of what his fellow chiropractors, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@docsnaps">Doc Manasseh</a>, calls “a new wave of chiropractors globally to have gone viral”.

<p>No one would argue that running isn’t good for you, but do we really have to pretend to like it, too?</p><p>For the 126th time this year, I turn the corner by the rowing club and begin the climb towards Stamford Hill. I have half a kilometre to go. Mist has settled on the river to my left, where waterfowls, Egyptian geese and a single, stately heron have gathered by some rushes in a dazzlingly pretty scene for Haringey in late November. They likely make some pleasant noises, but only the fortunes of HMS Royal Oak reach my ears, as my earphones sizzle with its battle against four French frigates near the Bight of Benin in the War of 1812. I am trying to enjoy myself.</p><p>Last November, with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/12/body-transformation-from-dad-bod-to-rad-bod-in-just-seven-weeks" title="">cooperation of this magazine</a> (ie they paid me), I defied my natural inclinations and did a radical diet and exercise overhaul. The experience produced not just an eminently readable lifestyle piece, but a substantial improvement in my general fitness. And then, shortly before Christmas, it ended, as did my adherence to its stipulations. I jettisoned the protein shakes and the thrice-weekly workouts, and gamely resumed my close personal relationship with butter, sugar, alcohol and grease. I discarded all the measures that had given me these results bar one – running.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/06/i-run-to-keep-fit-but-i-hate-it">Continue reading...</a>

The next day, the live audience peaked at 954,000, making it the most popular streamed workout ever.

He has mutinous backbenchers, he’s being outflanked by the opposition. The prime minister is fast running out of credibility<p>Ask any opponent of Boris Johnson what winds them up about him and it won’t be very long before they mention bananas. The prime minister used the fruit as a campaigning device in the 2016 referendum, claiming that the EU dictates “what shape our bananas have got to be” as evidence of Brussels meddling. There was rather less behind the claim than merited the attention it got: European commission regulations merely divide bananas into classes so those buying them know what sort they are getting. But it was typical of Johnson’s ability to make a point in primary colours while winding up the other side.</p><p>This weekend, as the talks on a post-Brexit trade and security deal reach their endgame, Johnson might think the bananas have had their time. Things are different now. He spent yesterday on the phone to Ursula von der Leyen trying to break the negotiations out of their deadlock and he has less opportunity to play political games while trying to deal with Covid. But the state of his party is such that he does need a bold, colourful way of changing the political debate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/06/if-oris-ohnson-is-to-unsettle-starmer-he-must-first-rally-his-own-squabbling-ranks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>While working from home have you had a cheeky nap? Don’t feel guilty. Research shows a brief kip boosts productivity. But will it catch on in the office?</p><p>Naps need to hire a publicist. Not in China, where desk-side snoozes are a constitutional right; Japan, where <em>inemuri</em> (“sleeping while present”) is a sign you’ve been working hard; or Spain, where siestas are woven into the social fabric. But in the UK, US, Australia and many other western countries – where capitalist rat races are fuelled by flat whites and billable hours – naps have a major image problem. They’re linked with laziness and lethargy; with people who can’t be bothered to get through the day.</p><p>Yet now is the perfect time to rebrand them as something we associate with a productive lifestyle. Go for a run! Guzzle a green juice! Take a nap! With a large proportion of people working from home (it is estimated that half the UK workforce will still be doing so at the end of 2020), lots of us have more control than ever over what our working day looks like. Our boss overlords have been forced to loosen the reins. Aside from those awkward Zoom team check-ins we’re pretty much free to do as we please as long as we get our work done. Should we so desire, we can take a 20-minute kip after lunch and emerge pin-sharp for a busy afternoon. After all, the sofa is right there, beckoning us over to enjoy a moment of shut-eye.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/06/sleeping-on-the-job-how-a-quick-nap-makes-us-more-efficient">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The court was correct to halt a disturbing trend among clinicians to assume those as young as 10 were fit to make life-altering decisions about gender identity</p><p>Can a child consent to life-altering and irreversible medical treatment as part of transitioning their gender? This was the fraught question at the heart of the case that Keira Bell took against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs the Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) for children with gender dysphoria. The high court’s <a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bell-v-Tavistock-Judgment.pdf">landmark ruling</a> clearly sets out that in referring children as young as 10 for puberty-blocking drugs, GIDS has been misinterpreting the law on child consent. It will ensure that children will now receive the protection to which they are legally entitled.</p><p>Bell’s story is distressing. From the age of four or five, she started to prefer clothes and games society associates with boys. As a teenager, she felt disgusted by her body and became depressed; then, at 14, she started to question her gender identity and researched transitioning online. At 15, she was referred to GIDS. She started taking puberty blockers when she was 16 and testosterone at 17, then had a double mastectomy when she was 20, three years ago. She has since decided to stop taking testosterone and has transitioned back to being a woman. “I made a brash decision as a teenager… trying to find confidence and happiness, except now the rest of my life will be negatively affected,” she said in her court submission.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/06/the-observer-view-on-the-high-courts-ruling-on-puberty-blocking-drugs-for-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ravinder Bhogal and Jay Rayner eat their way through the supermarkets’ mince pies, cheese, chocolates and more.

<p>After finding her feet in House of Cards, Rachel Brosnahan made the Marvelous Mrs Maisel all her own. Now she’s playing a 70s gangster’s moll on the run. Not bad for a self-confessed nerd and introvert…</p><p>During lockdown in New York, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/nov/28/its-about-a-woman-finding-her-voice-mrs-maisel-star-rachel-brosnahan-on-great-roles-and-controversial-men" title="">Rachel Brosnahan</a> really got into <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/australia-culture-blog/2014/oct/27/survivor-why-mess-with-a-reality-tv-formula-that-has-lasted-4000-years" title="">Survivor</a></em>. Like, <em>really</em> into it. There are 40 seasons of this reality show where contestants are marooned and left to fend for themselves, and for her and her husband Jason, this was… a re-watch. “It really is a mirror for our society,” she chirrups over Zoom, in the way people deep into a reality show sometimes do. “People from all different walks of life thrown together in a survival situation.” She has the <em>Survivor</em> patter, she has the <em>Survivor</em> socks, she has the <em>Survivor</em> water bottle, and, importantly, she has learned the <em>Survivor</em> lessons. Having completed the final series she graduated to a History Channel show called <em>Alone</em>, which is the same, but lonely. If Brosnahan were to be dropped into a jungle tomorrow, she’s confident she’d be absolutely fine. “I’ve picked up a thing or two.” Short pause while she considers it with some seriousness. “That is, if I had time to prepare. If not, I’d definitely get eaten.”</p><p>Brosnahan used to wrestle. A bookish “serious nerd” born in Milwaukee, she grew up in a sporty family, eventually persuading her publisher father and British mother that, though she’d been a snowboarding tutor and on the school wrestling team for years, her future was on stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/06/the-marvelous-mrs-maisels-rachel-brosnahan-you-can-always-find-a-way-forward-">Continue reading...</a>

As they approached Mosul from the east, they were met with the sight of an entire village decamping. The villagers had been told that at 6am the following day they would be rounded up by Isis fighters and taken to Mosul, where they feared they would be used as human shields against American bombing.</p><p>The residents of Buharbuq were carrying “children, grandmothers, pots, buckets, sheep, chickens” and hoping to find refuge behind Kurdish lines before the siege began. This girl, dressed in Yazidi style, was among the villagers that Pellegrin photographed on that road.

It was a thin document, referencing the obvious fact that without social distancing, pubs and restaurants are crowded places where virus transmission is likely.
