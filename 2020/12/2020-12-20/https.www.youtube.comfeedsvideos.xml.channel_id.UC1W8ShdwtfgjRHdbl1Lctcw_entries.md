I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of Chicago 1930s, even more than New York, the American city par excellence: exponential development linked to the development of exceptional resources, all-out innovations, particularly in architectural matters, a very diverse population of origin and social relations.
In 1930s Chicago’s population reached 3 million.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness 
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
