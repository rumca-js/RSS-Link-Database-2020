It can create complex chains of timed modulation, mute and unmute individual tracks or full tracks, save and load banks. It's super performative and quick to respond and absolutely has the ability to be the conductor of your entire eurorack system. In this video, we'll walk through how it works. You can watch all my musical experiments so far with the Maestro here: https://youtu.be/6uxPbObwsjQ\n\nGrab the Maestro wherever good eurorack stuff is sold. \nI recommend Patchwerks: https://patchwerks.com/products/acid-rain-technology-maestro-clocked-modulation-controller\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching. My name is Jeremy, and this is Red Means Recording. I've been making music for a few decades now, and this channel is a place to make music and to talk about the tools and techniques to make music with. We'll use synths, drum machines, modular gear, and software. \n\nIf you'd like to support the channel, I have a Patreon:  http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\n\nI have music as \"Jeremy Blake\" on all the major services: \nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\n\nI have some merch here: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\n\nAnd you can connect with me here: \nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFsYicNPQ4Q", "date_published": "2020-12-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
