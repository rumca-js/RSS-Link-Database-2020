An awesome YouTuber - Steve1989MREInfo sent us a box of military rations, or MRE from the USA and China, and then I picked one up from Japan. We decided to compare the three, to see what would fill us up the most, and also which one tastes the best, and which one would keep us alive. We reviewed the main dishes, which was Chinese fried rice, Japanese wiener rice, and USA spinach fehttuchini. China and Japan feed its soldiers MRE rations, just like any other country, but will they be any good?
