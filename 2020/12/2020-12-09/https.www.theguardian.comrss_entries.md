You have to be able to read the room, don’t you? Of course, that is hard to do when you are commissioning and filming months, or even a year and more in advance, in the case of, say, a documentary about the extravagant Christmas festivities laid on at one of the most famously extravagant hotels in the world. And when the post-lockdown cupboard is remarkably bare, I understand that you have not much choice but to show whatever remains therein.</p><p>Still, it must be noted that <a href="https://www.channel4.com/tv-guide">Christmas in New York: Inside the Plaza</a> (Channel 4) sits oddly with the national mood. In an average year, you could get away with an hour of fluffy puffery that narrowly escapes being an actual advertisement for whatever luxurious institution has graciously allowed a highly curated look behind the scenes. In a normal year, we would doubtless have been able to settle down on the sofa with a bucket of Baileys, turn off our minds and enjoy the sights on display at Manhattan’s famous hotel, built in 1907 in the hope of crapping all over the Waldorf-Astoria, which it duly did, becoming a favourite haunt of the Vanderbilts, presidents and Frank Lloyd Wright. We would boggle as the 600-plus staff at the hotel – which has also played host to film stars, the Beatles and Truman Capote’s Black and White Ball – prepare to pamper 21 floors of guests, each paying between £800 and £23,000 a night over the holiday season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/09/christmas-in-new-york-inside-the-plaza-review-screaming-entitlement-jars-in-2020">Continue reading...</a>

## Wild Mountain Thyme review – Emily Blunt's Irish romcom is a mess

<p>The actor stars alongside Jamie Dornan as stubborn farmers in this clumsy adaptation of John Patrick Shanley’s play Outside Mullingar</p><p>If you’ve seen the trailer for Wild Mountain Thyme, writer-director John Patrick Shanley’s not-quite-a-romcom about two thirtysomething “star-crossed” (slow to settle into their inevitable pairing) lovers/farmers in rural Ireland, then you’ve most likely slammed into the question: <em>what</em> is going on with the accents? The mere teaser, with narration by American actor Christopher Walken, triggered an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/11/wild-mountain-thyme-trailer-blamed-for-irish-accent-emergency">Irish accent emergency</a> upon its release last month. The fears were justified: the accents are indeed bad. But that could be overlooked, perhaps even be endearing, with the requisite romcom chemistry or whimsy found between two emotionally repressed, isolated people learning to open up. Unfortunately, Shanley’s adaptation of his 2014 Broadway play Outside Mullingar has little to recommend besides some truly beautiful shots of Ireland’s County Mayo – it’s a visually verdant but emotionally flat film whose confusing friction between two miscast leads frustrates rather than engrosses.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/09/the-midnight-sky-review-george-clooney">The Midnight Sky review – beardy George Clooney marooned in bland cosmic yarn</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/09/wild-mountain-thyme-review-emily-blunt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A small one-off levy on wealth would be a much fairer way of paying for the Covid recession</p><p>A funny thing happened in Buenos Aires last Friday: parliamentarians there voted by a chunky majority <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-55199058" title="">to slap super-rich Argentines with a tax</a> to pay for the economic damage done by Covid. Anyone sitting on wealth of over 200m Argentinian pesos (£1.8m) will have to pay a one-off levy that the government hopes will raise billions to buy medical equipment, support small business, and help poor neighbourhoods. The so-called “millionaire’s tax” was a remarkable move that has been noted around the world, along with the justification provided by one senator: “We must find points of connection between those who have the most to contribute and those who need it.”</p><p>Like Argentina, during this pandemic the UK has suffered a huge loss of life, a historic hit to GDP and a sudden acceleration of already-sharp inequality. Even with the dispensing of vaccines that with any luck will mark the beginning of the end to this health emergency, it is clear that its social, political and economic fallout will be with us for years to come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/09/the-guardian-view-on-taxing-the-rich-chip-in-to-help-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Like rugby, football is exposing players to the risk of dementia. Isn’t it time we at least tried to play without this risky skill?</p><p>Rugby’s reckoning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/08/rugby-union-dark-news-dementia-presents-sport-with-reality-dared-not-face">with dementia</a> seems to have arrived in a rush; in football, it has been a slower burner. As a West Brom fan, I have been aware of the issue longer than most. One of our greatest players, Jeff Astle, was famed as a brilliant header of the ball. When he retired from the game, he set up a window-cleaning business with the slogan “Jeff never misses the corners”. He died 19 years ago, at the age of 59, from a degenerative brain disease. The coroner recorded a verdict of death by industrial injury.</p><p>Ever since then, Jeff’s family, led by his daughter Dawn, have <a href="http://www.thejeffastlefoundation.co.uk/home">campaigned</a> to get the medical risks of heading the ball recognised. It has been a long struggle. I can’t say I have been a lot of help. I am ashamed to say that one reason for this might be that, as a presenter of football on ITV and the BBC, I was reliant on the game for my livelihood. Though no one ever told me to pipe down on the subject, I think I kept quiet for fear of biting the hands that fed me. Even as the evidence piled up, I kept shtum. I realise now that if I was self-censoring, then surely countless others were, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/commentisfree/2020/dec/09/football-without-headers-is-unthinkable-or-is-it">Continue reading...</a>

## Boris Johnson sets himself up for a disastrous dinner date | John Crace

<p>Meal with Ursula von der Leyen could be a brief one after Johnson resumed Brexit hostilities at PMQs<br /></p><p>One sometimes wonders whether Boris Johnson is aware you can watch British television in Europe. For either the prime minister was setting himself up for one of the biggest climbdowns – even by his own standards – in modern political history or his dinner on Wednesday night with the EU commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, is going to be one of the shortest on record. With awkward silences at that, as the EU appears in no mood to budge. Maybe Von der Leyen should rethink the menu and just go for chicken nuggets and chips so Boris can get an earlier flight home. Because at this rate a no-deal Brexit is looking a certainty.</p><p>The tone had been set right at the start of prime minister’s questions with Johnson’s reply to the Tory backbencher and longtime Brexiter Edward Leigh on the chances of a trade deal agreement. Boris didn’t even attempt to moderate his language. Not a word about how far both sides had come in the negotiation, just straight for the jugular about how the EU was trying to punish the UK and that if we didn’t get what we wanted on fishing rights, sovereignty and level playing fields then it could get stuffed. “We will prosper mightily” if we leave without a deal, he said. Leigh looked beside himself with pleasure. A further 2% fall in GDP was what he had always wanted. The orgasm that would make the four years of tantric Sexit that had preceded it worthwhile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/09/boris-johnson-sets-himself-up-for-a-disastrous-dinner-date">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From baroque masters to John Williams, Britten and the Muppets, the Sixteen’s music director has created a festive playlist for Guardian readers </p><p>No other festival in the Christian year has inspired so many tunes. Who could imagine Christmas without its rich tradition of music, from Bach to Bing Crosby, Slade to While Shepherds Watched? While many try to decide who is in their Christmas bubble, cathedral choirs up and down the country are hastily recording carol services and midnight masses so they can bring the spirit of Christmas into homes.</p><p>The best carols are ones that embrace basic emotions with words and music that are simple and approachable. That’s why I love traditional carols unadulterated by fussy arrangements and descants, although there’s one arrangement that is a family favourite: who cannot but smile and dance to David Willcocks’ infectious Sussex Carol? The carol originated as a round dance (the word is from the old French “<em>carole”</em>, a circle dance accompanied by singers), and with medieval carols, such as Make we joy now in this fest, everyone was encouraged to dance. Even the monks could join in, as long as they didn’t lift their feet too far off the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/09/deck-the-halls-harry-christophers-the-sixteen-christmas-playlist">Continue reading...</a>

But it is striking that something as important in its continuing consequences as the partition of Ireland, which took place 100 years ago this month, has been so widely neglected. There has been plenty of reflection on partition in Ireland itself, but there has not been much in Britain, which created the divide in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/29/ireland-brexit-northern-ireland-border">Government of Ireland Act</a> 1920.</p><p>The closure of the British mind regarding Ireland is not new.

<p>You’ll never understand a cranberry by eating a raw one – but used properly, the uniquely tart red jewels are hugely versatile, livening up savoury and sweet dishes alike</p><p>Every Thanksgiving, my mother made the same cranberry orange relish. It was the only time of year the hand-cranked grinder came out from the back of the cupboard to be suction-clamped to the kitchen table. The recipe was written on the bag the cranberries came in, and included whole oranges, peel and all, and a considerable amount of sugar. The finished product, if I’m being totally honest, never once passed my lips.</p><p>That’s because at some point during this annual event, I was always tempted to pop a fresh cranberry into my mouth. They looked, after all, like tiny cherries. But that is not what they tasted like. They had all the tartness of citrus fruit, and absolutely nothing else. It was enough to put me off them for another year. I like cranberries now, but as acquired tastes go, this one was particularly hard won. That classic <a href="https://www.oceanspray.com/en/Recipes/By-Course/Sauces-Sides-and-Salads/Fresh-Cranberry-Orange-Relish">recipe from the cranberry bag is here</a>. What’s it like?

I’m starting to wonder if that is how we will come to see his government’s impact on our country.

Chanté Joseph speaks to the people who make them – and the fans who can’t switch off</p><p>This year took a lot from us: birthdays, holidays, time with friends and family. Too many social interactions took place in tiny pixelated squares, where meetups started with the ceremonial: “Can you hear me? Is the mic on? Oh you’ve frozen. Oh wait, no, I’ve frozen.” Jittery wifi and pregnant pauses caused by weak connections made the steady, comforting flow of conversation more trouble than it was worth in many cases.</p><p>Technology slowly became exasperating, trying to catch up with friends a chore. So it’s unsurprising that podcast consumption on Spotify doubled between March and July. During the course of this year’s first pandemic lockdown, podcasts provided an uninterrupted flow of voices and company that helped us feel less lonely. When we really needed them, storytellers and newsmakers were there to accompany us at the touch of a button.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-sound-of-2020/2020/dec/09/voices-that-kept-us-hopeful-why-podcasts-were-essential-in-2020">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Guardian’s Paul Lewis and Rob Evans on investigating one of British police’s most covert units and learning that they were using the identities of dead children. Frank Bennett reflects on the impact of discovering that a police spy had stolen his dead brother’s identity to infiltrate two leftwing organisations, and to deceive a woman into a sexual relationship</p><p>In 2018, <strong>Frank Bennett</strong>’s sister Honor received a hand-delivered letter from a public inquiry about their 18-year old brother Michael Hartley, who had been reported missing at sea believed dead 50 years before. For a moment they thought Michael had been found, but in fact, the letter revealed that their dead brother’s identity had been stolen by a police officer who had penetrated two leftwing organisations. Using this false identity, the police spy had deceived a woman into a sexual relationship and had been prosecuted during his deployment. Frank talks to <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about his childhood and the impact his brother’s death had on him and his family. Knowing that years on, his brother’s name had been used by police has had a huge impact on his mental health he says. Their behaviour has been “disgusting”. </p><p>Anushka also talks to Guardian investigative editor <strong>Paul Lewis</strong> and Guardian investigative reporter <strong>Rob Evans </strong>about their decade-long investigation with activists to uncover the activities of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/24/special-demonstration-squad-undercover-unit-analysis">Special Demonstration Squad (SDS)</a>.
