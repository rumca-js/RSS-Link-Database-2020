Cyberpunk 2077 has a robust character creator that allows you to make delicate tweaks to all aspects of your character, V. You can adjust your hair, skin tone, and skin type… but Cyberpunk 2077 offers plenty many more options beyond those.

In the above video, we select a lifepath and then create a custom V for our Cyberpunk 2077 journey. We cycle through most of the customization options the game has on offer, and adjust V's tattoos, cyberware location, and even their eyeballs--it is the future, after all. A huge talking point for Cyberpunk has been its genital options, but unfortunately we had to blur those, sorry--take it up with YouTube. We also take a quick look at V's core attributes, like intelligence, cool, and reflexes.

Check out some spoiler-free side quest Cyberpunk 2077 gameplay, featuring a level 30 V. Captured on PC. 

We've seen extensive footage from Cyberpunk 2077's early game, including its in-depth character creator, and the various lifepaths that you can choose for your character. While we've seen V's humble beginnings, what about an upgraded, late game V? 

In the video above, we show gameplay from three different side quests, which we tackled with a level 30 character, showing off some late game abilities, and iconic weapons (yes, we have the Mantis Blades). Don't worry, there are no main story spoilers. 

In the first mission, Old Friends, V must infiltrate Karubo's Bar. Utilizing quickhacks and abilities like Synapse Burnout, we mess with the environment and hack enemies to clear the bar, before swapping to Mantis Blades to mop up remaining enemies. In the second mission, Jeopardy, we use stealth to infiltrate the morgue of a funeral home to steal a shard from a courier's corpse. In the third and final mission, we clear out a gang hideout, all guns blazing.
