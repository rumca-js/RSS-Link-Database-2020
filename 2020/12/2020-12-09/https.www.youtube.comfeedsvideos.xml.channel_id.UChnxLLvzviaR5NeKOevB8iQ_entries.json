[Hercules DJ Challenge (Part 1)]", "description": "Hercules challenged me to learn how to DJ but jokes on them I used to do that all the time. It's exactly like riding a bike, in that it's competitive and everyone's on drugs. Let's talk about why I think it can help you be a better electronic musician.\n\nI'm using the Hercules DJControl Inpulse 500, available at Sweetwater: https://fcld.ly/rmr500\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching.
