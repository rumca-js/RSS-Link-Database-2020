In 1999, the Canadian sisters independently released their debut LP, \"Under Feet Like Ours.\" Their poppy, emotive indie-folk style attracted the attention of Neil Young's label Vapor Records, who signed them in 2000. Since that year, Tegan and Sara have released eight full-length albums, the most recent being 2019's \"Hey, I'm Just Like You.\" Sisters Tegan and Sara Quin have visited The Current studio on a number of occasions, and we'll feature a selection of their live recordings in our upcoming On-Air Fest, happening December 12 and 13. Here are three of those live performances by Tegan and Sara at The Current.\n\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Alligator\" (2010)\n2:38 \"Stop Desire\" (2016)\n5:47 \"Boyfriend\" (2016)\n\nPERSONNEL\nTegan Quin \u2013 vocals, xylophone, guitar, shaker\nSara Quin \u2013 vocals, guitar\nTed Gowans \u2013 guitar, keyboards (2010)\nShaun Huberts \u2013 bass (2010)\nBrendan Buckley \u2013 drums (2016)\nEva Gardner \u2013 bass (2016)\nGabriel McNair \u2013 keys, backing vocals (2016)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Eric Sundheim; Laura Gill; Anna Weggel; Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Anna Weggel\n\nFIND MORE:\n2007 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2007/11/30/tegan_sara\n2010 session in the Forum at MPR: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2010/03/25/tegan_and_sara\n2013 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/03/07/tegan-and-sara\n2016 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/09/13/tegan-and-sara-perform-in-the-current-studio\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#teganandsara", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZMld9ASDSk", "date_published": "2020-12-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Happy Holidays from your friends at The Current", "description": "It's no secret that everything feels a little bit different this year, including the holidays.
