The fact that the government has been neither discussing or admitting this as a strong possibility is a further display of weak leadership that shies away from grasping the Covid nettle.</p><p>However, there is an urgent need for proper remote, teacher-led online learning to be put in place. The fact that the government left state school parents to home school was a national disgrace. As was the fact that it was never fully challenged by the mainstream media. We accepted parent-led home schooling like a nation of lemmings. We cannot return to that.

<p>In a world of superpower rivalry, the UK must urgently rebuild the strategic alliances that were sabotaged by its departure from the EU</p><p>Boris Johnson has a range of political skills, but international diplomacy is not among them. His greatest asset is a campaigning charisma with limited cultural range. The dishevelled look and irreverent <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/14/boris-johnson-life-xenophobic-gaffes" title="">bombast</a> are an act aimed at a domestic audience. It translates poorly abroad. In the global arena, reluctance to look serious forfeits respect sooner than it wins affection.</p><p>That is one reason why Mr Johnson did not acquit himself well as foreign secretary in Theresa May’s government. Another was that he hates serving anyone but himself. As prime minister, he has not sharpened up his act, but he is at least free to pursue his own agenda. What does that mean in foreign policy terms? There is Brexit, of course. But that has been a parochial matter in UK politics – perversely so, given that the country’s orientation in the world is at stake. The domestic debate has consistently lacked global perspective. The remain side failed to communicate the cost of surrendering a seat at European summits. The view that EU membership amplified British power was drowned out by the rhetoric of regaining mythic sovereignty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/28/the-guardian-view-on-britains-global-role-shrinking-around-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

There was one where I somehow landed a lucky punch to knock out Tyson Fury in the first round and, in the aftermath, every single pundit on the planet lined up on Sky News to say mean things about me, about how useless I was, not just as a boxer but as a person. There’s one where I sprinted through woods to escape the licking tendrils of flames, and then have failed tense job interviews with sweat beading on my forehead. I wake up exhausted at the horror my dormant mind has invented for no reason but to torture me. I wake up, frankly, afraid of the things I have created to be afraid of.

<p>The club captain refused travel guides to Manchester and Paris during an hour-long interview but admitted Barça are ‘in a really, really bad way’</p><p>Lionel Messi can begin negotiating with any team he likes in four days’ time, but he will not. That’s the good news for Barcelona fans and there is more. Like the Argentinian declaring “I feel good now, enthusiastic”, describing the arrival of Ronald Koeman as coach as a “great choice”, and insisting the “difficult, terrible” summer when he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/aug/26/lionel-messi-where-next-after-decision-to-leave-barcelona-manchester-city-psg-inter">tried to force his way out</a> is “behind me”. Or the fact that he called Barcelona “my life” and his connection to the club “a relationship of love”.</p><p>Many of those settling in to watch Sunday’s hour-long TV interview did so in search of optimism, reasons for hope. If they really looked hard – and they did – they might also have found it in how Messi talked about his problems in the past tense and his desire for the new president to return Barcelona to winning ways. They could cling, too, to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/27/barcelona-president-josep-maria-bartomeu-and-board-of-directors-resign">ousting of the former president Josep Maria Bartomeu</a>, who Messi said had conned him and briefed against him, and whose handling of Luis Suárez had been “mad”.

## Giving birth seemed to spell disaster for my mental health. Were my anxieties unfounded?

<p>I feared isolation, sleep deprivation and an end to the activities that had been keeping me well. I never expected to be filled with such love and wonder</p><p>I hadn’t expected to have a baby. But when I turned out to be wrong about that, I found myself expecting the whole thing to be a disaster. It wasn’t just that people tend to be rather negative about what early parenthood entails, focusing on the sleepless nights and endless nappy changes. It was also because I had a mental illness that I thought would make it impossible for me to cope at all, let alone enjoy motherhood. Neither had I expected to be giving birth in the middle of a pandemic, in which I would be cut off from much of my support network.</p><p>In the three years since I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jul/23/seven-ways-to-deal-with-post-traumatic-stress-disorder-ptsd">post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, as a result of a serious trauma in my personal life,<strong> </strong>I had spent a great deal of time trying to work out how to manage my illness. I planned my weeks around activities that research told me would help mend my mind a little. I knew that cold-water swimming, for instance, appears to help us control the fight-or-flight instinct that often goes so awry in mental illness. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/mar/04/moving-the-body-boosting-the-mind-running-your-way-to-better-mental-health">I knew that running could encourage the body to produce chemicals that lift the mood</a>.

<p>A treat for weekends or any special day – just add chocolate, cream and cranberries</p><p>I’d usually consider waffles to be a strictly weekends-only treat. But in this strange in-between week, where everyday feels like a weekend, the smell of freshly made waffles is something that feels fit for any morning. Almost all of the prep for these is done the night before and most of the ingredients should be easy to find. You may, however, struggle to lay your hands on pearl sugar, the key ingredient that gives these waffles their characteristic, sweet crunchiness; if need be, make your own by bashing sugar cubes with a rolling pin until they’re broken into apple pip-sized crystals. You will need a waffle iron to make these.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/dec/28/tamal-ray-recipe-belgian-waffles-with-ganache-and-amaretto-cream">Continue reading...</a>

The industry’s environmental issues are well known. It emits more carbon emissions than all international flight and maritime shipping combined, <a href="https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/story/putting-brakes-fast-fashion">according to UNEP</a>, the UN Environment Programme. The UK alone sends <a href="https://www.wrap.org.uk/content/re-use-overview">an estimated £140m worth</a>, or 350,000 tonnes, of used clothing to landfill. And 2020 highlighted the human cost of over-production, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/22/boohoo-selling-clothes-made-by-pakistani-workers-who-earned-29p-an-hour?CMP=share_btn_tw">grim reports</a> from Pakistani factories supplying clothes to Boohoo topping off a year in which garment workers in Bangladesh, Cambodia and Vietnam were among the first to pay the price of the pandemic as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/19/garment-workers-face-destitution-as-covid-19-closes-factories">western companies refused to pay for orders</a>.</p><p>But there has been good news too, even within the limitations of this strange, sad year – sometimes because of them. Here are five promising developments – from mindset shifts to disruptive technology – which could help us emerge from this wearing something we can feel good about.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/28/could-the-covid-pandemic-make-fashion-more-sustainable">Continue reading...</a>

## My fertility treatment failed three times in 2020 and I discovered how to live with uncertainty | Lynn Enright

<p>This was the year that certainty evaporated, but amid so much loss from Covid-19 I found small wonders to be thankful for</p><p>Before this year, I thought that you could be either “pregnant” or “not pregnant”. As it happens, it’s not always that simple. Last August, two weeks after an embryo was transferred to my uterus in the basement of a Harley Street fertility clinic, I held a pregnancy test up to the strong sunlight at my bedroom window. The control line, which indicated whether or not the test was working, was clear and dark pink. The test line, which indicated whether or not I was pregnant, was faint, like a shadow. In some light it was impossible to discern in some light – but standing at the window, there it was: hope.<br /><br />The embryo had been in a freezer for the best part of the year before it was transferred. It had been created using my egg and my husband’s sperm at our local hospital in east London because, due to illness, conceiving naturally was no longer possible for us. We had commenced treatment after almost a year on an NHS waiting list: I injected myself with hormones and doctors retrieved eggs from my ovaries; they were injected with my husband’s sperm and became embryos. Due to a complication, it wasn’t safe for them to be transferred straight away so they were frozen. On New Year’s Eve 2019, we toasted our three frozen embryos as we looked ahead to 2020: this would be the year I became pregnant, this would be a good year.<br /><br />In February 2020, the first of the frozen embryos was transferred. My husband was there with me, holding my hand, as the doctor placed it in my uterus. She reeled off instructions afterwards: no sex for seven days, no alcohol, no smoking, do an at-home pregnancy test in 13 days.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/08/it-feels-like-a-lost-year-the-women-who-fear-2020-has-stolen-their-chance-of-motherhood">‘It feels like a lost year’: the women who fear 2020 has stolen their chance of motherhood</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/28/fertility-treatment-failed-three-times-2020-uncertainty-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

They stirred the dormant ecowarrior within and inspired a resolution that I have kept since: to be a full-blown “dendrophile”, AKA “one who loves trees”.
