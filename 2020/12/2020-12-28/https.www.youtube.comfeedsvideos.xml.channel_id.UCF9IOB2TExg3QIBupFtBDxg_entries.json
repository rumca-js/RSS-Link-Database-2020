compared to the wild-type virus?\n\n20 September and 15 December 2020 \n\nDefined by a 90 day gap\n\nNew Variant case group\n\nTwo reinfections\n\n1.13 per 1000 cases\n\nWild-type comparator

this non-difference have implications for vaccine efficacy?\n\nYes, the same immune response generates immunity to both new variant AND wild viral strains\n\nDoes the new variant lead to more severe illness and deaths than the wild-type virus?\n\nIllness severity\n\nNo statistically significant difference in hospitalisation\n\nor 28-day case fatality\n\nDoes the new variant lead to more

reported to Test and Trace\n\n46,237 (4.2%) had genomic sequencing data\n\n1,978 had the variant (VOC 202012/01), 4.3% of those with sequencing data. \n\nA total of 228,361 of all contacts notified by cases in this period became cases \n\n15.1% among those whose index case was confirmed to have the VOC 202012/01 \n\n9.8% among those whose index case was sequenced and confirmed with other variants
