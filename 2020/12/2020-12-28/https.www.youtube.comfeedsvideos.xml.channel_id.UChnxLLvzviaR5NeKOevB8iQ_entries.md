This patch was made to try and figure out the Intellijel Rainmaker. It provides a delay line that freezes and ping-pongs.

Hermod has 4 sequences on it, each one with a different level of complexity I switch between them to create "song" sections, as well as mute and unmute tracks to create structure. I also use the mutes on the Varigate+ to mute and unmute drum tracks. Vocals were recorded as a second take through the TC Helicon Perform VE. Additional effects were from the ZOIA running a high-passed reverb and delay on all the sounds that weren't going into a eurorack effect.

The Piston Honda is getting fed through the SSF Stereo Dipole filter with modulation of both it's wavetables and the filter from Zadar's complex envelopes. I really don't know what I'm doing with Zadar. I just through it at things and see what happens.

Plaits is doing a chord sound now and then.

Rings is split between the Rainmaker and Z500. Even voices go to Rainmaker, odd voices go to the reverb on the Z500. 

The Pico Voice is doing a small background glitchy arp line being fed modulation from the ADE-32. It's running through the Harvestman filter.

Dixie is filtered through the Happy Nerding VCF. and then split between Rainmaker and Monsoon. I play the Dixie with an arp from the Keystep or by hand via the Keystep. I like having at least one mutable line I can play and react to throughout.

Tetrapad is set to increase reverb times on Z5000 and Monsoon, the filter cutoff on the Stereo Dipole, the time on the Z500, the wetness of the reverb on Monsoon, and the cutoff of the Pico Voice filter through the Harvestman.

The QD is doing a pretty standard drum line except for channel 4 which has some pretty gnarly glitch drums. The Rample is doing almost all glitches.
