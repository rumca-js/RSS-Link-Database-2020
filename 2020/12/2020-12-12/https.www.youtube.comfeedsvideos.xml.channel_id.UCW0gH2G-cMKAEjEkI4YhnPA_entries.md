The Blue Wizards are two of the most mysterious characters in Tolkien's Middle-earth.  The two versions of their story - the later coming in the final years of Tolkien's life - are very different.  Here, we will look at both, as well as some of the events going on in the East during the time they lived in that area of Middle-earth.  From Saruman also traveling to the East to Sauron hiding there multiple times and the Blue Wizards working against Sauron among the Easterlings.  
What do you think happened to the Blue Wizards?
