It\u2019s apt because he is many things: scholar, composer, writer, producer, entrepreneur, activist. He\u2019s also one of the most fascinating opera singers of his generation. His taste runs towards uncharted territory; he creates new roles with an expressive intensity of voice and body to reveal the complex humanity of each character he inhabits.\n \nI met Dav\u00f3ne last February, just before the world shut down. I\u2019d been on the road for weeks with a lingering cold, pulling into Boston on the last slow train out of Penn Station, late on a bitter winter night. In the morning, I dragged myself to rehearsal, bedraggled as a stray cat. It was a hectic schedule -- new music to rehearse, staging and light cues, a complicated show -- so it wasn\u2019t until our lunch break that Dav\u00f3ne and I really had a chance to say hello.\n \nIt took about five minutes for us to become friends -- for many reasons. We\u2019re both adventurous artists who make strange, beautiful things. We\u2019re highly disciplined breakers of rules. We both have 100 ideas every 10 minutes, and we act on 97 of them. We\u2019re opinionated and outspoken. We both care quite a lot about clothes. \n \nBut what cemented our friendship was a song. I had with me the sheet music of a newly-discovered song called \u201cWhen The Dove Enters In,\u201d composed by Margaret Bonds to a text by Langston Hughes. Close friends and collaborators, their creative connection was powerful; Bond\u2019s music revealed new harmonies and rhythms in Hughes\u2019 poems. This song is about the strength of human connection -- about redemption and salvation. I showed it to Dav\u00f3ne and we read through it together, finding immediate and true friendship in its notes and words. \n \nWe\u2019ve been working on this song for a while now, through all the changes this year has brought, and we were inspired to make a music video in collaboration with the visual artist Leila Victorin.\n \nThis is a conversation about revealing and embracing the fullness of our humanity, in our music, in our intentions and actions. You find us at the end of a long, hard year, looking back with all the longing that comes with isolation, grateful for a song we read together before the world shut down, and mindful of its meaning.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYnDSuG3Y48", "date_published": "2020-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
