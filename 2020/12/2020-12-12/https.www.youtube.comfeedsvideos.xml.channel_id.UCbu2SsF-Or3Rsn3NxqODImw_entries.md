We've returned with more of Call of Duty's most broken guns! In our previous list, Richie Bracamonte went over many of broken guns featured throughout the series' long history. Some were silly and barely functional, and remembered for how poorly they performed. This time, Richie returns with only the most overpowered broken weapons picked by our viewers. These guns are infamous for their destructive power are most were subject to a much-needed patch in order to rebalance the multiplayer experience.  

Even though patching and/or "Nerfing" a weapon is commonplace today, a handful of these guns are still fan-favorites for their competitive edge, and some would say that they're still broken. Shotguns such as Black Ops III's 205 Brecci, Modern Warfare's 725, and of course Modern Warfare 2's iconic 1887s (featured in Part 1) all had above-average ranges. In the submachine class, contenders like World at War's MP40 and MW3's MP7 hit hard and fast. They also featured quick times to kill and high fire rates. In some cases, guns like the MP5 are broken in nearly every game they're featured it.    

In our review of Cold War, Kallie Plagge explains how "The Cold War setting allows for a lot of variety from one map to the next, which helps the limited slate feel richer; a highlight in terms of aesthetic are Miami's neon-soaked streets. Each core 6v6 map balances close-quarters spaces with long-range sightlines, and in my experience, they mostly translate well from one mode to the next."

Want to know just how different Cyberpunk 2077 looks on PlayStation 5? Check out this graphics comparison between a base PS4 model and PS5. 

Cyberpunk 2077 is a stunning game… if you're playing it on the right systems. It's being hailed as "the new Crysis" on PC, and you'll need a powerful graphics card to be able to run CD Projekt Red's latest at its highest settings. But little footage of the game was shown on console pre-release.

Now that Cyberpunk 2077 has been released, we can finally dig deeper into its console versions. In this video, we compare the game running on PlayStation 5 to the base PlayStation 4 model to see just how much difference Sony's brand new console makes. It should be noted that the version running on PS5 is actually the PS4 version of the game, playable through backwards compatibility. A patch to upgrade the game for PlayStation 5 will be released next year.

Cyberpunk 2077 is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Stadia.

Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the realistic weaponry of Escape From Tarkov, including the Makarov pistol, the FN P90 submachine gun, and the AK 101 assault rifle.

Escape From Tarkov is a brutally realistic take on the first person shooter genre, and its fictional region of Norvinsk is full to the brim contemporary firearms like the M4A1 carbine, the AS Val rifle, the SV-98 sniper rifle, and KS23 shotgun.

In the above video, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the weapons of Escape From Tarkov, and compares their in-game depictions against their real-world counterparts.

At this year's Game Awards, we got a sneak peek at upcoming PS5 and Xbox Series X games like the Perfect Dark reboot, The Callisto Protocol, and a brand new Mass Effect. The Generation Next gang talk about their favorites.

The Game Awards 2020 featured a ton of announcements, ranging from world premiers of new games to gameplay teasers for already anticipated titles. And plenty of those announcements had to deal with games coming to Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.

On this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor provide their immediate reactions to what went down at The Game Awards. The trio also talk through their respective impressions of the show as a whole and how it has contributed to the conversation surrounding the new generation of consoles--from the reveal of Xbox Series X to the advertisement of upcoming AAA titles and indie titles coming exclusively to the new consoles in 2021 and beyond, including The Callisto Protocol and Perfect Dark.

Generation Next is a weekly video series focused on discussing Xbox Series X|S and PS5. Sometimes that means sitting down for a serious discussion and other times that means mixing in some good points among lots of silly bants. It's usually the latter.

00:28 - No Elden Ring at the Game Awards
01:29 - Perfect Dark announced for Xbox and PC from The Initiative
