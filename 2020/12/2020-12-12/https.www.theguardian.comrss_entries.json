If these three games in seven days are to define their season as the narrative had declared, far from coming to a premature end it looks set to turn out nice again. Zinedine Zidane was on edge and on an ultimatum, his team threatened with elimination from the Champions League group stage for the first time ever and with being left so far adrift domestically as to be virtually done. But they did what they always seem to do in situations like these and rose again, beating Sevilla, beating Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and doing what no one had done since February by beating Atl\u00e9tico Madrid too.</p><p>On Friday afternoon Zidane had declared Atl\u00e9tico favourites to win the league; on Saturday night his team defeated their city rivals 2-0 with a first-half goal from Casemiro and then an own goal by Jan Oblak. Diego Simeone\u2019s team had not lost for 26 matches \u2013 going back to the last time they faced Real Madrid \u2013 and although they remain top, the title race was opened up at Valdebebas. It is one that includes Real now, too. Not just because of the score, but also because of the script this game followed. As for Zidane, here was more evidence that the only reason to doubt him is that it is precisely that doubt, that danger, which brings the best from his players.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/12/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/12/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-la-liga-match-report", "date_published": "2020-12-12 22:57:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Gylfi Sigurdsson penalty lifts Everton and ends Chelsea's unbeaten run", "description": "<p>The former Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti embraced his assistants to celebrate a first home win for more than two months while the current custodian surveyed a crestfallen scene at Goodison Park.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/dec/12/everton-v-chelsea-premier-league-live\">Everton 1-0 Chelsea: Premier League \u2013 live reaction!</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/12/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/12/everton-chelsea-premier-league-match-report", "date_published": "2020-12-12 22:05:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "In US Covid-19 hot zones, firefighters now \u2018pump more oxygen than water\u2019", "description": "<p>Firefighters are often thrust into frontline health emergencies.

He walked in for his first fitting and I showed him images and black-and-white videos of people in the 40s doing the lindy hop and going out partying. He started doing some of his James Brown moves in the room, to get us into the mood \u2013 I was amazed at his dancing abilities. Thurgood Marshall would have had the tie and the pinstripe double-breasted suit and the pocket squares, so I put all of those things on Chadwick and he started to embody, maybe for the first time, what he was feeling about the character. It was wonderful to work with someone who wanted to connect costume to character like that.</p><p>He was a very thoughtful person, and quiet, but not necessarily reserved. Once you asked him a question, he was an open book, but he wasn\u2019t volunteering the information, probably because he wanted to hear what you had to say.
