The two versions of their story - the later coming in the final years of Tolkien's life - are very different.  Here, we will look at both, as well as some of the events going on in the East during the time they lived in that area of Middle-earth.  From Saruman also traveling to the East to Sauron hiding there multiple times and the Blue Wizards working against Sauron among the Easterlings.  \nWhat do you think happened to the Blue Wizards?\n\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings!  \n\nNerd of the Rings on PATREON: https://www.patreon.com/NerdoftheRings\n\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
