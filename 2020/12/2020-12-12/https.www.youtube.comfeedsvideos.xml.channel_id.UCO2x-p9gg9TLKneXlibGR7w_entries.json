The hardware is impressive and we\u2019ll talk about why/how it\u2019ll change Apple\u2019s lineup in the next video, but in this video we\u2019re going to talk about something arguably more important: the macOS software experience. The new macOS 11 Big Sur marks a huge paradigm shift in how Apple expects the Mac to be used and we\u2019ll talk about how the software at play like iOS app usage, Rosetta 2 translation and even running Windows VM on M1 Macs have changed the way that these new computers can be used.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff98l3P66i8", "date_published": "2020-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
