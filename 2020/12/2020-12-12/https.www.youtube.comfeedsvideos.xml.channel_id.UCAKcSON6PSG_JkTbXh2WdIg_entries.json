At The Current, we were so fortunate that Lizzo lived in our local community for a few years as her career took flight. She visited our studio on a number of occasions and performed at our live events in different configurations: with the Chalice, with GRRRL PRTY, and of course, as a solo artist. We'll feature a number of live-concert performances by Lizzo during our On-Air Fest, happening Saturday and Sunday, Dec. 12 and 13. Meanwhile, here are three unforgettable in-studio performances recorded by Lizzo at The Current.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Paris\" (2014)\n3:11 \"Cuz I Love You\" (2019)\n6:17 \"Juice\" (2019)\n\nPERSONNEL\nLizzo \u2013 vocals\nSophia Eris \u2013 backing vocals (2014)\nLazerbeak \u2013 beats (2014)\nWalter Williams \u2013 guitar (2019)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Helen Teague\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens; Michael DeMark\n\nFIND MORE:\n2013 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2013/10/21/lizzo\n2014 The Current Birthday Party, live at First Avenue:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/02/06/current-9th-birthday-videos\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/12/10/lizzo-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2016 GRRRL PRTY live at Rock the Garden:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/06/30/grrrl-prty-perform-at-rock-the-garden-2016\n2019 studio session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/05/07/lizzo-in-the-current-studio\n\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#lizzo", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8w-7yc4hFA", "date_published": "2020-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
