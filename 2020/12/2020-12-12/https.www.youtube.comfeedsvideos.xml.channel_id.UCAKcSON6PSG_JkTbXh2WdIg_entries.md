Lizzo is a superstar. At The Current, we were so fortunate that Lizzo lived in our local community for a few years as her career took flight. She visited our studio on a number of occasions and performed at our live events in different configurations: with the Chalice, with GRRRL PRTY, and of course, as a solo artist. We'll feature a number of live-concert performances by Lizzo during our On-Air Fest, happening Saturday and Sunday, Dec. 12 and 13. Meanwhile, here are three unforgettable in-studio performances recorded by Lizzo at The Current.

0:00 "Paris" (2014)
3:11 "Cuz I Love You" (2019)
6:17 "Juice" (2019)
