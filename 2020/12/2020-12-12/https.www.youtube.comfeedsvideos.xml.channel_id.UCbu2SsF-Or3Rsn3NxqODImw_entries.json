In our previous list, Richie Bracamonte went over many of broken guns featured throughout the series' long history. Some were silly and barely functional, and remembered for how poorly they performed. This time, Richie returns with only the most overpowered broken weapons picked by our viewers. These guns are infamous for their destructive power are most were subject to a much-needed patch in order to rebalance the multiplayer experience.  \n\nEven though patching and/or \"Nerfing\" a weapon is commonplace today, a handful of these guns are still fan-favorites for their competitive edge, and some would say that they're still broken. Shotguns such as Black Ops III's 205 Brecci, Modern Warfare's 725, and of course Modern Warfare 2's iconic 1887s (featured in Part 1) all had above-average ranges. In the submachine class, contenders like World at War's MP40 and MW3's MP7 hit hard and fast. They also featured quick times to kill and high fire rates. In some cases, guns like the MP5 are broken in nearly every game they're featured it.    \n\nIn our review of Cold War, Kallie Plagge explains how \"The Cold War setting allows for a lot of variety from one map to the next, which helps the limited slate feel richer; a highlight in terms of aesthetic are Miami's neon-soaked streets. Each core 6v6 map balances close-quarters spaces with long-range sightlines, and in my experience, they mostly translate well from one mode to the next.\"\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:19 - MP40 (World at War)\n00:55 - FR 5.56 Shotgun (Modern Warfare)\n01:43 - Sniper Rifles (Black Ops 2)\n02:25 - MP7 (Modern Warfare 3)\n03:15 - FAL OSW (Black Ops 2)\n03:51 - Famas (Black Ops 1)\n04:21 - ACR 6.8 (MW2 & MW3)\n05:05 - M16 and AUG (Cold War)\n05:52 - 725 Shotgun (Modern Warfare)\n06:35 - MP5 (Modern Warfare & Cold War)\n07:19 - VMP (Black Ops 4)\n08:05 - AS-VAL (Modern Warfare)\n09:01 - Proteus Shotgun/Sniper (Infinite Warfare) \n09:47 - Fennec (Call of Duty Mobile)\n10:10 - 205 Brecci Shotgun", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wy8VUyopQEI", "date_published": "2020-12-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "12 Biggest Trailers From The Game Awards 2020", "description": "Watch some of the best trailers and game reveals that came out of The Game Awards 2020, including a new Mass Effect, a teaser for Dragon Age 4, the return of Perfect Dark, and more.\n\nAlongside a celebration of 2020's best video games, The Game Awards was packed with new trailers and world premieres for upcoming titles.\n\nIf you didn't sit through the entire three-hour long show but still want to catch the big announcements from the event, we've got you covered with this round-up of the 12 biggest trailers from The Game Awards 2020.

Check out this graphics comparison between a base PS4 model and PS5.\u00a0\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a stunning game\u2026 if you're playing it on the right systems. It's being hailed as \"the new Crysis\" on PC, and you'll need a powerful graphics card to be able to run CD Projekt Red's latest at its highest settings. But little footage of the game was shown on console pre-release.\n\nNow that Cyberpunk 2077 has been released, we can finally dig deeper into its console versions. In this video, we compare the game running on PlayStation 5 to the base PlayStation 4 model to see just how much difference Sony's brand new console makes. It should be noted that the version running on PS5 is actually the PS4 version of the game, playable through backwards compatibility. A patch to upgrade the game for PlayStation 5 will be released next year.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is available now on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Stadia.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNP0alPlhaU", "date_published": "2020-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Firearms Expert Reacts to Escape From Tarkov\u2019s Guns", "description": "Jonathan Ferguson, a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries, breaks down the realistic weaponry of Escape From Tarkov, including the Makarov pistol, the FN P90 submachine gun, and the AK 101 assault rifle.\n\nEscape From Tarkov is a brutally realistic take on the first person shooter genre, and its fictional region of Norvinsk is full to the brim contemporary firearms like the M4A1 carbine, the AS Val rifle, the SV-98 sniper rifle, and KS23 shotgun.\n\nIn the above video, Jonathan Ferguson--a weapons expert and Keeper of Firearms & Artillery at the Royal Armouries--breaks down the weapons of Escape From Tarkov, and compares their in-game depictions against their real-world counterparts.\n\nIf you're interested in seeing more of Jonathan, you can check out more from the Royal Armouries right here. - https://www.youtube.com/user/RoyalArmouries \n\nIf you would like to support the Royal Armouries, you can make a charitable donation to the museum here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/donations/\u00a0\n\nAnd if you would like to become a member of the Royal Armouries, you can get membership here. - https://royalarmouries.org/support-us/membership/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSRDwTlp9OM", "date_published": "2020-12-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5 and Xbox's Biggest Reveals at Game Awards 2020", "description": "At this year's Game Awards, we got a sneak peek at upcoming PS5 and Xbox Series X games like the Perfect Dark reboot, The Callisto Protocol, and a brand new Mass Effect.

And plenty of those announcements had to deal with games coming to Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.\n\nOn this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Jordan, and Tamoor provide their immediate reactions to what went down at The Game Awards. The trio also talk through their respective impressions of the show as a whole and how it has contributed to the conversation surrounding the new generation of consoles--from the reveal of Xbox Series X to the advertisement of upcoming AAA titles and indie titles coming exclusively to the new consoles in 2021 and beyond, including The Callisto Protocol and Perfect Dark.\n\nGeneration Next is a weekly video series focused on discussing Xbox Series X|S and PS5. Sometimes that means sitting down for a serious discussion and other times that means mixing in some good points among lots of silly bants.
