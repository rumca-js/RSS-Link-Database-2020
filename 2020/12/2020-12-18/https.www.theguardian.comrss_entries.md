<p>An unlikely FA Cup triumph cannot mask 12 months of average league form under a manager yet to convince</p><p>As a brisk December breeze swirled through Goodison Park’s stands, a fresh wind was sweeping in at Arsenal. Mikel Arteta looked on from the front row of the directors’ box, flanked by the chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, and the then head of football, Raul Sanllehi, the day before he officially took charge. He was hardly alone in furrowing his brow during a tedious stalemate between his new side and Everton, who were about to begin their own renewal, but inside his heart was soaring. “I remember sitting in the stands and thinking: ‘I can’t wait to start working with the players and the club,’” he said on Friday.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/17/we-do-stupid-things-anxiety-stalks-arsenal-as-their-troubles-mount-aubameyang">'We do stupid things': anxiety stalks Arsenal as their troubles mount</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/dec/18/mikel-arteta-treads-uncertain-path-at-arsenal-after-year-of-ups-and-downs">Continue reading...</a>

But on Christmas Day you will usually find me hovering beside the piano, waiting impatiently for the carolling to begin.</p><p>My mother will play the accompaniment, my sister will sing the melody, I’ll find a harmony and my brother will take the bassline.

Other highlights of Strictly Come Dancing in 2020 have included the touching chemistry between TV presenter Ranvir Singh and her partner Giovanni Pernice, and the deadpan verdict “G-O-A-T” delivered by judge Craig Revel Horwood (“It normally stands for greatest of all time,” he explained to a bemused audience). Strictly has long occupied a prized spot in the nation’s home entertainment schedule. But with this series, its 18th, the show has surpassed itself. With viewing figures topping 10m, and cinemas, parties and theatres all out of reach, the show has been an oasis of glitter in a desert of a season.</p><p>The physicality of Strictly has always been part of its appeal, and this has been strengthened under pandemic conditions. To an audience confined at home, prohibited from touching anyone outside our bubbles and unlikely to have formed new bonds of friendship or love, the spectacle of 12 celebrities – now whittled down to four for Saturday’s final – twirling, lifting and clutching each other has held a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/12/craig-revel-horwood-is-making-strictly-wholesome-and-inclusive-fun" title="">particular enchantment</a>.

<p>Gal Gadot does battle with supervillains and everyday sexism in DC’s cliche-clobbering sequel.

Everyone is staring at her – but this is no Cinderella moment, with admiring glances and a collective gasp. It’s an exposé of sexual harassment. The camera switches to Diana’s POV, and we experience a series of persistent, entitled men cracking on to a woman who is clearly not interested. It’s a rare case of a superhero movie showing everyday sexism from the woman’s point of view.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/15/wonder-woman-1984-review-gal-gadot-kristen-wiig-patty-jenkins">Wonder Woman 1984 review – queenly Gal Gadot disarms the competition</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/18/wonder-woman-1984-metoo-superhero-movie-gal-gadot">Continue reading...</a>

## Experience: I lived as a wild turkey

<p>My aim was to become indistinguishable from the rest of the flock, but I felt they saw me as the village idiot</p><p>I started adopting young animals while still a child myself. Many were orphaned newborns, meaning I mothered a variety of creatures – raccoon, squirrel, fox, bobcat, whatever came my way. I felt the animals preferred my company to that of members of their own species, and many even slept in my bed. At the time, I thought I’d discovered a sort of magic; but after years of studying animal behaviour, I learned of a process known as imprinting, whereby young creatures become attached to the first moving object they encounter.</p><p>I was keen to explore this phenomenon further, but it wasn’t until I was in my 40s that I got the chance. In the early 90s, I was living on a large tract of land in rural Florida, working as a wildlife artist and researcher. One day, I was given a dog bowl full of wild turkey eggs by a tractor driver who had almost driven over them. I had to act fast, procuring an incubator at short notice and turning the eggs twice a day, as a turkey hen would. I would regularly “vocalise” at them, recreating the putts and purrs a wild turkey would make on its nest, in order to get the eggs accustomed to my voice. A week or so into the experiment, I started to hear peeped responses from them and the first tiny beak broke through.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/18/experience-i-lived-as-a-wild-turkey">Continue reading...</a>

When we were kids growing up on a housing estate in Strasbourg, my mother had a ritual: on Sundays, she would play French chanson for us. Léo Ferré, Jacques Brel, Charles Trenet, Georges Brassens, and Juliette Gréco. She was the only female artist in the pack so not only did her mysterious voice have a distinctive impact on me, I also assumed she was a tough cookie with character. In my young boy’s mind, she was their equal, a great artist, period. Years later, as I was relaxing at home in the midst of recording my second solo album, I switched on telly and here she was with her husband Gérard Jouannest who had been Jacques Brel’s pianist and composer, and I thought how amazing it would be to meet them. The following morning, I told the sound engineer at my record company. It just so happened that he had recently worked with Juliette Gréco. He was our go-between. I sent her my work and she agreed to meet. One day, she opened the door of her house near Paris to me and we became friends for the next 13 years, spending Christmas and holidays together.</p><p>When Gréco met new people, what she was interested in was to find a poetical connection with them. No poetry, no friendship. It didn’t matter that you were from a different milieu, a different country, a different culture, or belonged to a different musical genre, generation, political family or even that you shared the same convictions. The only thing that she cared about was poetry, and style. And a love for words and the written text.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/18/juliette-greco-remembered-by-abd-al-malik">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By trying so hard to be really, really nice, the prime minister risks making the festive season harder for all of us</p><p>There’s nothing more worrying than being told not to worry, when there are clearly things to worry about. Such as the super-spreading event formerly known as Christmas. Don’t fret, it’s still on! Or, technically, it’s still on because to cancel Christmas would be “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/dec/16/boris-johnson-it-would-be-inhuman-to-cancel-christmas-video">inhuman</a>”, according to the prime minister, Boris Johnson. With the small caveat that, if we can, we really <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/16/keep-christmas-small-and-short-urges-boris-johnson-covid-coronavirus">shouldn’t choose to celebrate it</a> in the old-fashioned, in-person way. Not that he wants to spoil our collective enjoyment or anything, but the fewer of us that spend time with family, the less likely we are to cause thousands of people to die. But hey, who is the prime minister to tell us what to do?</p><p>By trying so hard to be really, really nice Johnson risks making us all crazy. Instead of instructing us on what to do (and basing his edict on the course of action likely to cause the least damage) he is instead inviting us to “think hard and in detail” about how to handle Christmas. As I gather from the people I work with in therapy, this is precisely what everyone was already doing. Anybody with any kind of conscience is beating their brain, calculating all eventualities that may result from showing up for lunch in a week’s time – one of which involves inadvertently killing your aged parents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/18/boris-johnson-christmas-anxiety-nation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Steve McQueen’s five-film anthology based on real people and events celebrates Britain’s Caribbean history, enriches our national story and is a television landmark</p><p>So much of 2020 has been spent discussing, debating and disputing history, from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/13/removal-of-controversial-statues-winston-churchill-protest">removal of statues</a> (“erasing our history” as the complainers would have it) to the reassessments of Britain’s legacies of slavery and colonialism, all prompted by the resurgence of Black Lives Matter. In this context, Small Axe couldn’t have picked a better moment, or found a better means of expression. Far from “erasing” British history, Small Axe enriches it. It fills in gaping holes in our national story that many of us barely even realised were there. It will doubtless stand as Steve McQueen’s magnum opus, and a landmark of British television. Yet this five-film series represents just a glimpse of that missing history: the experience of Caribbean immigrants in London, from the late 1960s to the 1980s. The fact that this was virtually uncharted territory tells its own story.</p><p>When it comes to social history, there’s a tendency on British TV to adopt a dry, sober docudrama mode or to dramatise the story to death with reams of dialogue, slick editing and grandstanding overstatement. Small Axe does neither. Its stories are based on real people and events: the trial of the Mangrove Nine; a typical all-night reggae party in 1980; the early career of trailblazing policeman Leroy Logan; the hard coming of age of the writer Alex Wheatle; and the story of a smart 70s schoolboy branded as “educationally subnormal” (based on McQueen’s own experience). But they are full of emotion, passion, feelings, day-to-day experiences, food, music, conversation, dance, sensuality – life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/18/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2020-no-3-small-axe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>William Boyd remembers an exemplar of the ultimate literary professional, tirelessly writing at the top of his game well into his 80s</p><p>I can still remember the strange thrill I experienced on first reading <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/24/carre-spy-came-cold-boyd">The Spy Who Came in </a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jul/24/carre-spy-came-cold-boyd">from the Cold</a></em>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/johnlecarre">John le Carré</a>’s third novel, published in 1963, and the one that made his name and brought him lasting international success. I must have been in my early 20s, I suppose, but I can vividly recall that feeling of privileged access that the book gave to you – as if you were being let into a private club, a clandestine world for initiates only. It was a bafflingly difficult novel, also, and that added to the engagement. When I came to read more le Carré I discovered that you, the reader, were expected to pay attention. Only that way could you participate in the slow and tortuous decryption of what was going to be revealed as the narrative unspooled. The concentrated act of reading became an almost physical pleasure. That self-conscious, deliberate, teasing difficulty about his novels was – for me, certainly, and I suspect for almost all of his readers – his particular trademark. Reading a le Carré novel became an act of collaboration between reader and author: what the author hinted at or alluded to and what the reader then had to deduce. It proved a most beguiling connection and he manipulated it with enormous skill.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/14/john-le-carre-remembered-margaret-atwood-john-banville-ian-rankin">John le Carré remembered by writers and friends: 'He always had a naughty twinkle in the eye'</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/dec/18/john-le-carre-didnt-invent-the-spy-novel-he-joined-a-tradition-and-made-it-new-again">Continue reading...</a>

## 'They are willing to sacrifice everything': Ai Weiwei pays tribute to the Hong Kong protesters

<p>The artist’s documentary, Cockroach, tells the inside story of the 2019 demonstrations against mainland China’s brutal clampdown – a tough task when he’s not allowed to return</p><p>When Ai Weiwei was growing up in China, it was customary for people from the mainland to look down their noses at Hong Kongers. “We thought they had no serious culture. We thought they were colonial subjects only interested in making money and martial arts films. They weren’t political,” the exiled 63-year-old artist recalls over WhatsApp from the back of a car parked in Lisbon.</p><p>That childhood view gets turned on its head in Ai’s deeply moving documentary Cockroach, about the Hong Kongers who took to the streets to protest against overweening Chinese rule last year. It’s they who become cultured, utopian and offered political resistance to the mainland’s barbarous clampdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/dec/18/ai-weiwei-hong-kong-protesters-documentary-cockroach-interview">Continue reading...</a>

He peers into his webcam as he walks, offers a “Yo!”, and finds a quiet corner of a Los Angeles studio to sit down, then whips off his headgear to reveal spidery braids and a black beard.

It’s as consistent as it has always been.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/18/daveed-diggs-pixar-wanted-feedback-from-a-ton-of-black-folks">Continue reading...</a>

It was maybe the film world’s last happy international event and talking-point before the industry was plunged into lockdown, chaos and a fearful sense that things might never be the same again. But the spectacular success of Parasite brought a welcome revival on UK streaming services of so much of this director’s great back catalogue, including his remarkable Memories of Murder from 2003, based on South Korea’s then unsolved Hwaseong serial murders of the late 1980s – the film sparked an upsurge of interest in the case, and led finally to the culprit’s identification in 2019. Parasite continues to exert a grip, and even had the distinction of getting a luxury-connoisseur black-and-white version released. That was certainly an intriguing new slant, though in my view not as good as the richly and densely coloured original.<br /><br />Parasite, in all its cruelty and ingenuity, actually seems even more claustrophobically appropriate to our new world of hunkering down uneasily together with our families, and forming bubbles with other households, or perhaps transgressing, going into bubbles where we have no business and disobeying physical distancing rules. Perhaps the film is fundamentally about precisely this – the abolition of distancing rules, a world in which the underclass are cramped together and then get up close and personal with the overclass. It’s a film whose satirical reflex extends to a vision of South and North Korea living together in paranoid, resentful intimacy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/18/the-50-best-films-of-2020-uk-no-1-parasite">Continue reading...</a>
