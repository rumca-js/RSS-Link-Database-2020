Scenes from New York's Christmas parade, sponsored by R. H. Macy and Company, shot from corner of 80th Street. The parade started at 110th and Broadway and ran to 34th Street, site of Macy's Department Store. Floats feature the comic strip Katzenjammer Kids and other comic series of the time.

On Thanksgiving morning in 1924, Macy’s department store in New York City held a parade to drum up business and publicity. The theme was Christmas (and shopping for gifts).

Store employees dressed in outrageous costumes and walked six miles from Harlem down to the Macy’s flagship store in Herald Square, accompanied by festive floats and animals from the Central Park Zoo.

The first parade ended with Santa Claus ascending to a golden throne above the store’s entrance and inviting thousands of customers to come and shop.

The parade was such a success that it became an annual tradition.
