I felt the animals preferred my company to that of members of their own species, and many even slept in my bed. At the time, I thought I\u2019d discovered a sort of magic; but after years of studying animal behaviour, I learned of a process known as imprinting, whereby young creatures become attached to the first moving object they encounter.</p><p>I was keen to explore this phenomenon further, but it wasn\u2019t until I was in my 40s that I got the chance. In the early 90s, I was living on a large tract of land in rural Florida, working as a wildlife artist and researcher. One day, I was given a dog bowl full of wild turkey eggs by a tractor driver who had almost driven over them. I had to act fast, procuring an incubator at short notice and turning the eggs twice a day, as a turkey hen would. I would regularly \u201cvocalise\u201d at them, recreating the putts and purrs a wild turkey would make on its nest, in order to get the eggs accustomed to my voice.

When we were kids growing up on a housing estate in Strasbourg, my mother had a ritual: on Sundays, she would play French chanson for us. L\u00e9o Ferr\u00e9, Jacques Brel, Charles Trenet, Georges Brassens, and Juliette Gr\u00e9co. She was the only female artist in the pack so not only did her mysterious voice have a distinctive impact on me, I also assumed she was a tough cookie with character. In my young boy\u2019s mind, she was their equal, a great artist, period. Years later, as I was relaxing at home in the midst of recording my second solo album, I switched on telly and here she was with her husband G\u00e9rard Jouannest who had been Jacques Brel\u2019s pianist and composer, and I thought how amazing it would be to meet them. The following morning, I told the sound engineer at my record company. It just so happened that he had recently worked with Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He was our go-between. I sent her my work and she agreed to meet. One day, she opened the door of her house near Paris to me and we became friends for the next 13 years, spending Christmas and holidays together.</p><p>When Gr\u00e9co met new people, what she was interested in was to find a poetical connection with them. No poetry, no friendship. It didn\u2019t matter that you were from a different milieu, a different country, a different culture, or belonged to a different musical genre, generation, political family or even that you shared the same convictions. The only thing that she cared about was poetry, and style.

The fact that this was virtually uncharted territory tells its own story.</p><p>When it comes to social history, there\u2019s a tendency on British TV to adopt a dry, sober docudrama mode or to dramatise the story to death with reams of dialogue, slick editing and grandstanding overstatement. Small Axe does neither. Its stories are based on real people and events: the trial of the Mangrove Nine; a typical all-night reggae party in 1980; the early career of trailblazing policeman Leroy Logan; the hard coming of age of the writer Alex Wheatle; and the story of a smart 70s schoolboy branded as \u201ceducationally subnormal\u201d (based on McQueen\u2019s own experience). But they are full of emotion, passion, feelings, day-to-day experiences, food, music, conversation, dance, sensuality \u2013 life.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/18/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2020-no-3-small-axe\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/dec/18/the-50-best-tv-shows-of-2020-no-3-small-axe", "date_published": "2020-12-18 08:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "A memorable year: readers reveal their silver linings", "description": "<p>From rediscovering nature in 2020 to getting to grips with Zoom, readers tell us what they gained in a year when so much was lost</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>It was a year to forget, but one we will always remember.

It was maybe the film world\u2019s last happy international event and talking-point before the industry was plunged into lockdown, chaos and a fearful sense that things might never be the same again. But the spectacular success of Parasite brought a welcome revival on UK streaming services of so much of this director\u2019s great back catalogue, including his remarkable Memories of Murder from 2003, based on South Korea\u2019s then unsolved Hwaseong serial murders of the late 1980s \u2013 the film sparked an upsurge of interest in the case, and led finally to the culprit\u2019s identification in 2019. Parasite continues to exert a grip, and even had the distinction of getting a luxury-connoisseur black-and-white version released. That was certainly an intriguing new slant, though in my view not as good as the richly and densely coloured original.<br /><br />Parasite, in all its cruelty and ingenuity, actually seems even more claustrophobically appropriate to our new world of hunkering down uneasily together with our families, and forming bubbles with other households, or perhaps transgressing, going into bubbles where we have no business and disobeying physical distancing rules. Perhaps the film is fundamentally about precisely this \u2013 the abolition of distancing rules, a world in which the underclass are cramped together and then get up close and personal with the overclass. It\u2019s a film whose satirical reflex extends to a vision of South and North Korea living together in paranoid, resentful intimacy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/18/the-50-best-films-of-2020-uk-no-1-parasite\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/18/the-50-best-films-of-2020-uk-no-1-parasite", "date_published": "2020-12-18 06:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Does Megxit mean Megxit?
