Phase 1/2 trial of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with a booster dose induces multifunctional antibody responses, (Nature Medicine, 17th December)

Viral vector coronavirus vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AZD1222)

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-01179-4

190 vaccines currently in development

Neutralizing antibodies against the viral spike protein correlate with protection

Additional antibody functions may also be important in preventing infection

Two jabs, 56 days apart

SD/SD  n = 20

SD/LD n = 32

A booster dose is safe and better tolerated than priming doses

After second dose

Increased anti-spike neutralizing antibody titers,

Increased cell mediated immunity

Increased neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis

Increased complement activation

Increased natural killer cell activation

SD / SD

Stronger antibody responses

T cell responses did not increase with either booster dose

These data support the two-dose vaccine regime that is now being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials
