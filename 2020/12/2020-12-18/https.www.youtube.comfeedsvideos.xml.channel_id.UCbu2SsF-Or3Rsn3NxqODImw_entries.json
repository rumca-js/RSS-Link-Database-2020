Since the game was first revealed in 2012, we had to wait six years before we saw a 48-minute long work in progress gameplay video.\u00a0\n\nNow, Cyberpunk 2077 has finally been released, and we can compare those work in progress visuals to the finished product. In the above video we compare scenes from two key moments in the game, an early mission where V and their friend Jackie Welles are on a job to rescue a wealthy woman who has been kidnapped by scavengers, before visiting the Ripperdoc to enhance V's cybernetics. Then, we take a look at a second mission, where V and Jackie met Militech agent Stout, and infiltrate the Maelstrom gang hideout to pick up an advanced bot for fixer Dexter DeShawn.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor more graphics comparisons, check out our look at the game running on a base PS4 and a PS5.

Guess we should start referring to the new consoles as the current generation, huh? Still sounds weird though, to be honest.\n\nIn the weeks following their launch, Xbox and PlayStation have released updates for their respective new consoles, ranging from bug fixes to quality of life adjustments. Even Xbox Series X|S and PS5 are hard to find, at least both Microsoft and Sony have shown a commitment to improving the experience on their consoles for those who do happen to have one.\n\nSeveral games have received significant upgrades on the new consoles as well, such as Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Borderlands 3. It all pretty much boils down to 4k support at 60fps but a few titles have received other notable improvements, such as splitscreen co-op and 120fps.\n\nOn this episode of Generation Next, Lucy, Tamoor, and Jordan go over all of this. The Gen Next crew is thankful that it hasn't run into any major issues with their Xbox Series X|S and PS5 consoles just yet--hopefully their luck extends into 2021.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:54 - PS5 DualSense USB charging fixed\n02:26 - Next-Gen game patches (Miles Morales, Borderlands 3, etc.)\n05:49 - PS5 stability issues (game crashes, cloud saves, etc.)\n10:47 - Xbox Series X/S Update (Auto HDR, Badges, etc.)\n13:24 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO95ubklQts", "date_published": "2020-12-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
