## Here's what we know about the new variant of coronavirus | Sharon Peacock

<p>My team at the Genomics UK consortium sequenced the new Sars-CoV-2 variant, but we’ll need more evidence to understand how it might change the pandemic</p><p>It was always predictable that the genome of Sars-CoV-2 would mutate. After all, that’s what viruses and other micro-organisms do. The Sars-CoV-2 genome accumulates around one or two mutations every month as it circulates. In fact, its rate of change is much lower than those of other viruses that we know about. For example, seasonal influenza mutates at such a rate that a new vaccine has to be introduced each year.</p><p>Even so, over time the virus population will accumulate a fair few mutations in different combinations. The striking feature of the Sars-CoV-2 lineage 1.1.7 that we discovered here at the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium (familiar now from headlines as the “new variant”), is that its genome has a large number of mutations compared with other lineages we’ve picked up in the UK. It has a total of 23, which is what sets it apart.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/new-variant-coronavirus-genomic-sars-cov-2-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Away facilities upgraded before quarter-final of League Cup, a competition Tottenham’s manager has won four times</p><p>The forecast is for rain and 4C or, to put it another way, the kind of midweek evening in Stoke that asks a particular question of visiting players. For José Mourinho and his Tottenham squad, who are coming to town for their Carabao Cup quarter-final on Wednesday, there is a consolation. At least their dressing room will not be a pigsty.</p><p>The state of the facilities for away teams at the Bet365 Stadium have been on Mourinho’s mind for a while. The Middlesbrough manager, Neil Warnock, brought them to public attention at the start of the month, saying his players had to change in a portable building with blocked toilets, leaky showers, no heating, water on the floor and fumes coming in from an engine outside. “It was a pigsty – and the pigs would’ve run away if they’d been there,” Warnock said.

For centuries, this precious hoard has been kept in a series of leaky, draughty rooms in the palace, gradually filling up every cramped corner.

<p>Stress and overconsumption of food and alcohol leave people feeling less amorous, find researchers</p><p>If Christmas leaves you feeling less than amorous, you’re not alone.

<p>The 23-year-old sports star is a fully fledged national hero. It’s time to celebrate his commitment and grace – but remember he should not have to do any of this</p><p>In April, when Matt Hancock suggested that Premier League footballers should <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/matt-hancock-scored-an-own-goal-with-his-cheap-shot-at-footballers">“play their part” in helping ease the financial crisis</a> caused by the pandemic, what he meant was that they should accept sweeping cuts to their salaries. You know, just like MPs didn’t. What the health secretary could not have imagined was that one footballer would “play his part” by launching a snowballing campaign to prevent children in England from going hungry. Or that in doing so he would highlight underlying inequality and the plight of England’s poorest families.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, the most urgent task facing the England star Marcus Rashford was recovering from a double stress fracture in his back so that he would be match fit for his Manchester United games. But that turned out to be a minor detail in his extraordinary year (his vertebrae got none of the media attention they were due). Instead, in the spring, with the pandemic having brought the 2019-20 season to a halt, the 23-year-old centre-forward used his free time and growing influence to become a formidable voice for social justice. He took on the UK government – and, crucially, won over the public, too. So now, at the end of this bleak year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/oct/09/marcus-rashford-given-mbe-in-birthday-honours-for-school-meals-campaign">Marcus Rashford MBE</a> is a fully fledged national hero, recognised here and abroad for his poverty activism as much as for his footballing talent.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/dec/22/what-marcus-rashfords-campaign-for-hungry-children-tells-us-about-the-footballer-and-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the west African country, not everyone likes girls to play instruments – but this group of seven ultra-cool musicians are ripping up those expectations</p><p>André Balaguemon has a flair for the trumpet and for getting things done. In 2016, this single-minded multi-instrumentalist from central Benin moved to Natitingou in the remote agricultural northwest of the country, and had a chat with the mayor. He had the idea to set up music workshops for local girls, using his own instruments so they wouldn’t have to pay. The mayor got on board, wrote a radio appeal for volunteers, and provided a rehearsal space. Eighteen girls turned up outside the town hall.</p><p>Four years and several serendipitous encounters later, a honed group of seven girls (including Balaguemon’s two daughters, Angélique on drums and Grâce Marina on keys) have been formed. Star Feminine Band’s debut album – recorded live in just two days – sees them cross linguistic and stylistic borders, taking in local Waama rhythms, Congolese rumba, highlife and Sierra Leonean bubu. Exuberant songs are composed, written and arranged by Balaguemon (“The girls bring their ideas, but I do everything”) and unfold in multiple languages (Waama, Peul, Ditammari, Bariba, Fon, French), with ululations and call-and-response so good you can’t not get on your feet. As 10-year-old Angélique puts it: “When we play, everyone dances.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/22/star-feminine-band-benin-girl-group-west-africa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A gang of macho Moscovites battle to save humanity in a sci-fi tale that offers a close encounter with the land of nod</p><p>We’re all going to die. And if you decide to sit through this crashingly loud apocalyptic Russian sci-fi, you may find yourself willing the fate of the Earth to hurry on up. It opens in Moscow in the nearish future, a neon cityscape where flying cars zip past glass skyscrapers. Off-duty soldier Oleg (Aleksey Chadov) is on a date in a swanky penthouse restaurant when planes start dropping out of the sky. Without warning, the world is plunged into darkness – everywhere except Moscow and the surrounding area. From here a garbled and very boring plot is spun.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/01/the-50-best-films-of-2020">The 50 best films of 2020 in the UK: the full list</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/22/the-blackout-invasion-earth-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To undo the damage Trump has wrought at home and abroad, the US must move beyond outdated foreign policy ideas<br /></p><p>Democracy is in disrepair. Over the past four years, President Donald Trump has mocked its rules and norms, accelerating the decay of democratic institutions in the United States. We are not alone: a global reckoning is underway, with authoritarian leaders capitalizing on broken promises and failed policies.</p><p>To reverse the trend, President-elect Joe Biden has proposed to convene a Summit for Democracy. His campaign <a href="https://joebiden.com/americanleadership/">presents the summit</a> as an opportunity to “renew the spirit and shared purpose of the nations of the Free World”.

<p>From the superb Stuart Broad and Monty Panesar to the less celebrated Boris Johnson and Cricket South Africa</p><p>Spending a fortnight locked in a quarantine hotel with a 10-month-old, as I learned in Perth this month, can inspire any number of strange decisions. For me, this included going back to read the earliest editions of this column. And before going any further, yes, I’m well aware it was this type of behaviour that made me so popular in high school. But it was all with a purpose in mind: to pen this end-of-year reflection, aiming to work out the origin of <em>The Spin</em> annual awards – inventively titled … <em>The Spins</em>.</p><p>Of course, it was Lawrence Booth who started this newsletter – cricket’s answer to <em>The Fiver – </em>in time for England’s 2002-03 Ashes hiding. By the end of the next home summer, awards season arrived, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2004/dec/31/thespin.cricket">morphing into a Christmas stocking-stuffer</a> in late 2004. From there it was a handy “get-out clause” – to quote the now-<em>Wisden</em> supremo – when there wasn’t much else on. By the time Andy Bull was on the tools, it was more often than not rebadged as a Test XI of the year, others occasionally flirting with the earlier lampooning style at the end of an English season. Given the shambolic time 2020 has been, I feel compelled to follow suit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/22/the-spins-end-of-year-cricket-awards-for-a-shambolic-2020">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Available online </strong><br />This online stream of a 2016 Soho theatre show whips through the young comic’s angst and uncertainty</p><p>There’s a moment in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/aug/23/rhys-james-why-did-i-get-into-stand-up-so-young-jack-whitehall">Rhys James</a>’s 2016 show Forgives when the 25-year-old composes a letter to his 40-year-old self.

As he turns 30 in the new year, James and the rest of us can check back in with his younger self: his generational angst, his uncertainty about his place in the world, the questions he’d pitch to the grownup he’ll one day become.</p><p>All of which makes Forgives sound more contemplative than it is. In fact, it never gives us pause to contemplate anything. This was James’s third solo show, and finds him still in the precocious stage of his development: clever, great at writing jokes, but not giving much of himself away – perhaps because (beyond his physical immaturity and romantic inadequacy, which he over-emphasises) there’s not yet much to give. These 48 minutes unfold at a clip, as if he’s desperate to keep ahead of us, forever on to the next joke before we think too hard about the last one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/22/rhys-james-review-slick-quickfire-standup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From actor Jon Voight to Kirstie Alley, Trump’s celebrity fans have declared war on the left – and there is little sign hostilities will end soon<br /></p><p>On 11 November, Midnight Cowboy and Coming Home star Jon Voight <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/11/jon-voight-donald-trump-re-election-campaign-civil-war">posted a video</a> on Twitter. “This is our greatest battle since the civil war,” he said, referring to the election results. “The battle of righteousness versus Satan, yes, Satan. Because these leftists are evil, corrupt and they want to tear down this nation.” Voight’s support of President Trump has been full-throated. His video messages promote conspiracy theories about the election and use violent language.

<p>He was so angry he could pick up red-hot coals with his bare hands. And all because of my Auntie Marj</p><p>Two things happened that Christmas in the late 70s; my Auntie Marj was involved in both. Marj was one of my nan’s sisters. She lived with a lot of cats on the Coventry Road in Birmingham. She had a big personality and a frame to match – there was a lot of her to love. Her catchphrases were: “You’ve got to laugh,” and “I’ve never seen the like in all my nudge.” Nudge? She had a ferocious, wheezy laugh, which would often give her cause to fish in her bag for a large, primitive black inhaler device for her asthma. She’d pump away at this to settle things down before resuming frivolities.</p><p>I was sitting on the floor playing a game with my brother when she arrived that Christmas morning. I must have been about 11. “Stand up, Ade,” she said. “Let’s have a look at you.

He was slow off the mark, slow to the ball, slow to react. Occasionally entire passages of play seemed to pass him by.

One of the many reasons for this was to stop natural selection doing its work. When a virus is allowed to spread, spending time in different hosts, it evolves and mutates. Scientists have now found a “mutant” variant of the virus that causes Covid-19, which has <a href="https://www.cogconsortium.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Report-1_COG-UK_19-December-2020_SARS-CoV-2-Mutations.pdf">17 alterations</a> to its genetic sequences, including changes in the spike protein that enables the virus to enter our cells.</p><p>Despite the warnings, the government’s strategy throughout the pandemic has been to slow the spread of the virus and reduce pressure on the NHS, rather than eliminating Covid altogether. As late as 13 March, <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/888783/S0383_Fifteenth_SAGE_meeting_on_Wuhan_Coronavirus__Covid-19__.pdf">Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) minutes</a> recorded that “measures seeking to completely suppress [the] spread of Covid-19 will cause a second peak”. Advisers warned that countries such as China, where heavy suppression was already under way “will experience a second peak once measures are relaxed”. Instead of eliminating coronavirus, the logic seemed to be, Britain would learn to live with it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/22/uk-government-blamed-covid-19-mutation-occur">Continue reading...</a>

The orbital paths of the two huge planets ensure great conjunctions every 20 years, but many are impossible to see with the naked eye because they happen during the daytime. Great conjunctions happen when Jupiter, which laps the sun in a shade under 12 years, and Saturn, which orbits every 29.5 years, come into near alignment with the Earth. It will be 2080 before the planets align so closely again</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/gallery/2020/dec/22/jupiter-and-saturns-great-conjunction-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Guardian health editor Sarah Boseley looks at the fast-spreading Covid variant that has prompted the prime minister to put London, the south east and the east of England into tier 4 and more than 40 countries to ban UK arrivals because of concerns about the spread </p><p>Yesterday Boris Johnson held an emergency Cobra meeting to look at the emergence of a new Covid variant that has prompted flights from the UK to be suspended to countries across the world including Spain, Italy, Canada, India and Hong Kong. France has shut its border with the UK for 48 hours, meaning no lorries or ferries can leave from the port of Dover.</p><p>The Guardian’s health editor, <strong>Sarah Boseley</strong>, talks to<strong> Rachel Humphreys </strong>about what we know so far about the variant, which is said to be as much as 70% more transmissible than previous versions. It now accounts for more than 60% of new infections reported in London. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said there was no evidence that this strain of the virus was more lethal. But faster transmission would mean more cases, which could lead to more hospitalisations and deaths. On Monday, Prof Neil Ferguson, a member of the government’s New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), said preliminary data hinted that the variant could more effectively infect children, though causality had not been established.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/22/the-new-strain-of-coronavirus-that-has-cancelled-christmas">Continue reading...</a>
