Congratulations go out to Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie, whom The New Yorker named its Pandemic Person of the Year for December 21. "Adam Weiner [is] the songwriter, singer, piano player, and chief showman behind the band — and occasional solo act — Low Cut Connie," wrote Nick Paumgarten in the New Yorker. "His sixth album, 'Private Lives,' came out this fall. … What has enabled him to show off his … chops and his bountiful good vibes — Little Richard meets Mr. Rogers, maybe — is his twice-weekly interactive live stream, called 'Tough Cookies,' which he began in March. Deprived of the thrill and the income of performing live, he started broadcasting from the guest room of his row house, in South Philadelphia." 
Weiner is a friend of The Current; he and Low Cut Connie have performed in our studio a number of times, played Rock the Garden 2018 and played at our Day Party during SXSW 2019. Weiner has hosted the radio program The Connie Club, and not long before the pandemic, Weiner performed a solo MicroShow at the Bryant Lake Bowl in south Minneapolis for a roomful of lucky attendees. Here are three live performances by Adam Weiner and Low Cut Connie, recorded for The Current. 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Help Me" (2019)
3:12 "Private Lives" (2019)
7:08 "Stay As Long As You Like" (2020, solo)

Sunday, Dec. 20, was the birthday of Billy Bragg! Billy has visited our studio a handful of times, but we only have a couple videos to share. The first is from deep in our archives: Bragg's performance of "Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards" from SXSW 2008, which begins with a bit of Bragg's signature banter. Next, we have a more recent performance, a 2016 duo with Joe Henry from Bragg and Henry's collaborative album, "Shine A Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad." Happy birthday, Billy Bragg, and we hope to see you again before too long.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards" (2008)
5:16 "Railroad Bill" (2016, with Joe Henry)

PERSONNEL
Billy Bragg – vocals, guitar
Joe Henry – vocals, guitar
