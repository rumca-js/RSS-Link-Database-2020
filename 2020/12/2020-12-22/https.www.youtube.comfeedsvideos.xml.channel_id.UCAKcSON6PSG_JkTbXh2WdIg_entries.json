Deprived of the thrill and the income of performing live, he started broadcasting from the guest room of his row house, in South Philadelphia.\" \nWeiner is a friend of The Current; he and Low Cut Connie have performed in our studio a number of times, played Rock the Garden 2018 and played at our Day Party during SXSW 2019. Weiner has hosted the radio program The Connie Club, and not long before the pandemic, Weiner performed a solo MicroShow at the Bryant Lake Bowl in south Minneapolis for a roomful of lucky attendees. Here are three live performances by Adam Weiner and Low Cut Connie, recorded for The Current. \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Help Me\" (2019)\n3:12 \"Private Lives\" (2019)\n7:08 \"Stay As Long As You Like\" (2020, solo)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Patrick Galbreath; Devon Quick; Helen Teague; Eric Romani; Lauren Cutshall\nAudio: Erik Stromstad; Michael DeMark; Eric Romani\nProduction: Brett Baldwin; Luke Taylor\n\nFIND MORE:\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/02/26/low-cut-connie-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/05/27/low-cut-connie-keep-the-swagger-in-rock-n-roll\n2018 Rock the Garden performance:\nthecurrent.org/feature/2018/07/02/low-cut-connie-ignite-the-crowd-at-rock-the-garden\n2019 The Current Day Party during SXSW:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/03/17/watch-low-cut-connie-perform-at-the-current-day-party-in-austin-texas-sxsw\n2019 The Connie Club episode 4:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/11/02/listen-the-connie-club-episode-four-with-guest-cat-oriordan\n2020 Adam Weiner MicroShow at the Bryant Lake Bowl:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/02/03/low-cut-connie-adam-weiner-plays-a-solo-microshow\n2020 Adam Weiner of Low Cut Connie Virtual Session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/04/28/adam-weiner-of-low-cut-connie-plays-an-uplifting-live-virtual-session\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#adamweiner #lowcutconnie", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDjW34AzewA", "date_published": "2020-12-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Bartees Strange - Virtual Session", "description": "Bartees Strange joins Jade for a virtual session to talk about leaving places that prevent you from feeling free, covering The National and SAMIA, and what he's working on in his studio for his family this Christmas.
