SO sit back and relax while we review all the Christmas themed VR games I could find. \n\nI reviewed almost all the VR games that were about Christmas only last year, and almost no new ones were made, I hope I wasn\u2019t responsible\u2026 So instead I looked to all my other VR headsets for Christmas themed VR games. We cover the Oculus Quest 2, the Vive, the Index, The Rift and I played some VR phone games\u2026 but they were terrible.\n\nThe Rift had a number of Christmas themed VR games that I played but didn\u2019t review in this video, simply because they were terrible.\n\nAnyway. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. Enjoy my Christmas themed VR bonanza.\n\nAll my music and sound is from here: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/8pficg\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/UpIsNotJump \nMerch: https://www.pixelempire.com/products/... \nTwittz: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump\n\nEdit Workflow by Milo at Speedwagon Productions www.speedwagon.me\n\nSuper special thanks to my members!\nCorbin Carter\nGreenCoatGaming\nTheMediaJack\n\nDance of the Sugar Plum Fairy by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 licence. https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100270\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Py9UCdNCwDw", "date_published": "2020-12-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
