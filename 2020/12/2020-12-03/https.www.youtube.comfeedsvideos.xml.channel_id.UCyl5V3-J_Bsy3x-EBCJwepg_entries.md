Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk about the week’s biggest stories like Biden’s all-female communications team reminding us that we should already know what’s wrong in the nation, Biden’s arm falling off in peanut butter jar opening attempt, and a bowl of porridge getting a record-shattering 80 million votes.
