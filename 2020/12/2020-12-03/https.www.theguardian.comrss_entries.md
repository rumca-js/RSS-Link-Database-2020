<p>Tensions arise between a writer and her coterie aboard an ocean liner in Steven Soderbergh’s sweet, unfocused drama</p><p>There’s an awful lot going on in this new movie from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/stevensoderbergh">Steven Soderbergh</a>. The title is appropriate: it’s garrulous, elegant, bristling with classy performances from an A-list cast, and Deborah Eisenberg’s screenplay has a theatrical intimacy. It’s loosely and waywardly plotted, perhaps as a result of having gone through many drafts, though maybe not enough. It is slightly unfocused and uncertain as to where its emotional centre really lies – though there is a charm and a big dramatic finale.</p><p>The story is mostly set (and economically filmed, by Soderbergh himself) on a luxury liner, , the Queen Mary 2, crossing from New York to Southampton. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/merylstreep">Meryl Streep</a> plays Alice Hughes, a renowned novelist whose reputation and sales rely chiefly on a sensational early book about the collapse of a woman’s marriage. Her agent (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/28/gemma-chan-film-interview-nothing-will-top-the-night-i-pole-danced-with-celine-dion">Gemma Chan</a>) takes her out for lunch and has to charm her cantankerous client into going to London to accept a prestigious award; she is also nervous about the fact that Alice still hasn’t delivered her latest manuscript but excited at the rumours that it could be a sequel to the sensational early book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/dec/03/let-them-all-talk-review-steven-soderbergh-meryl-streep-gemma-chan">Continue reading...</a>

Former French president who brought in socially liberal reforms but whose grand style ultimately proved offputting to voters<p>As Valéry Giscard d’Estaing became the Grand Old Man of French politics – a position he held for at least two decades – it became harder to recall the intellectually brilliant and reforming politician who in 1974 became the Fifth Republic’s youngest president.</p><p>Giscard, who has died aged 94, was 48 when he became president and only 55 when he stopped, after one seven-year term, meaning he experienced his political career go into decline at an age when most of his contemporaries were only just making a bid for high office. Thereafter Giscard fought to remain relevant, particularly in European politics, as he saw off his bitter rivals – <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-francois-mitterrand-1323110.html" title="">François Mitterrand</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/26/jacques-chirac-obituary" title="">Jacques Chirac</a> – to become the longest lived former French president in history. It would be a mistake, however, to remember Giscard, or VGE as he was often known, solely for his longevity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/03/valery-giscard-destaing-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## 'We're the UK's biggest boy band!' Michael Ball and Alfie Boe, the new kings of Christmas

<p>Having recovered from coronavirus, the singers stuffed choirs and orchestras into a Christmas album to lift the spirits – and are now the most successful UK duo in chart history<br /></p><p>“We’ve topped the charts more than Wham! or Chas &amp; Dave? We’re a mixture of them both,” jokes Michael Ball. I have just informed Ball and Alfie Boe that their three UK album No 1s also outstrip Simon &amp; Garfunkel and, indeed, any non-family singing duo in history (the Carpenters also scored a trio, but two were greatest hits). Equally impressively, Ball &amp; Boe’s latest chart-topper, the festive collection Together at Christmas, is outselling BTS, the world’s biggest pop group.</p><p>“So we’re the biggest boyband in the country!” explodes Ball, 58, like a child opening a present, although the duo’s armoury of skills has not extended to the technical demands of the Zoom interview. The first words Ball says to me are: “How do we turn the camera on, Alf?” But suddenly, here they are – two grinning mates in dinner suits, their album cover come to life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/03/were-the-uks-biggest-boy-band-michael-ball-and-alfie-boe-kings-of-covid-together-at-christmas">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This newly-restored 16th-century hotel and inn, immortalised by the novelist, had a rocky start due to the pandemic. But, unlike most of his stories, there is hope of a happy ending</p><p>Dorchester is at the heart of what the National Trust calls “Hardy Country” – and he is everywhere. Not that I mind. I’m a big fan of his Wessex novels. And I was pretty excited to be spending the night in a newly reopened hostelry that gets a mention in at least one of them. Thomas Hardy was a regular at the King’s Arms. He is said to have devised, or even written The Mayor of Casterbridge in a room upstairs. Casterbridge is a fictionalised Dorchester, but he refers to the town’s “chief hotel” by name, describing a “spacious bow-window, projected into the street over the main portico” – exactly as it is now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/dec/03/thomas-hardy-favourite-hotel-inn-kings-arms-dorchester-review">Continue reading...</a>

It’s also symbolic of a trend that has come to blight the British Christmas: a repeated failure of NPD. Those letters should stand for New Product Development.

<p>Risk-taking is increasingly rare in the modern game and urgent action is required to keep fans interested</p><p>Given the time of year, rugby union needs to go shopping for charismas. Amazon Prime dipped into the petty clash to find the £20m to secure the television rights for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/12/amazon-gives-rugby-20m-lifeline-and-could-spark-six-nations-bidding-war">Autumn Nations Cup</a>, but it is difficult to argue it has had value for money.</p><p>The game in Europe is in one of its sclerotic periods on the field and mired in administrative inertia off it. Amazon has the final it would have hoped for on Sunday with England and France offering the most potential new subscribers, but <em>Les Bleus</em> are having to field a reserve team. That’s because the Top 14 clubs and the French Rugby Federation agreed that no player would appear in more than three matches this autumn, which started with a warm-up to the Six Nations finale. Does that merit a rebate?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/dec/03/rugby-union-obsession-with-defence-must-be-tackled-if-game-is-to-thrive-the-breakdown">Continue reading...</a>

Drama student Daisy Widdess*, who found a flat last week, says she is one of the lucky ones. “A lot of people have absolutely no idea who they’re going to live with.

Bullies latched on to Pengsoo’s towering frame – at nearly 7ft, Pengsoo is almost twice the height of the average emperor penguin – and its large, unblinking eyes.</p><p>“The other penguins didn’t play with me because I was too big,” 10-year-old Pengsoo told producers at a studio in the Korea Educational Broadcasting System (EBS) headquarters in Seoul in April 2019. Sitting in a gray room, empty save a too-small chair positioned beside a childish self-portrait, Pengsoo stared at the producers as it spoke. Pengsoo had swum to South Korea from the Antarctic “not too long ago”, it said, in the hopes of becoming the next big sensation on YouTube, which was “getting very popular” in its homeland. But the bullying there had been too much.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/dec/02/pengsoo-penguin-south-korea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With its celebrity collaborations and turbo-charged launches, Philip Green’s Topshop brought fun and drama to the once uninspiring business of clothes-shopping.

Are you stupid or what? I’ve never read so much rubbish in my life.”</p><p>It was February 2010, and I was at my desk in the Guardian office. Philip Green didn’t need to introduce himself. His habit of bellowing down the phone was unmistakable, and I had just written <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/feb/02/topshop-high-street-fashion">an article about how I was falling out of love with Topshop</a> after a decade being in thrall to its shop floor.

<p>He was ‘the first black punk in Hull’ and was named one of the world’s 50 most beautiful people. But the singer turned his back on pop stardom. He reveals why he’s returning with a gritty musical about a band called The Blacks</p><p>There are no film posters up in Roland Gift’s house in Holloway, London, and the platinum discs are all packed away. It’s a home that gives few clues to the remarkable life story the 59-year-old is about to recount: how the “first black punk in Hull” went on to become an international pop and movie star. </p><p>“I’ve always been afraid of getting wrapped up with fame and that glamour world,” is how he puts it today. Indeed, even when Gift’s band, Fine Young Cannibals, topped the charts on both sides of the Atlantic with their 1989 second album, The Raw &amp; the Cooked (reissued this month, along with their eponymous 1985 debut), he had an uneasy relationship with stardom. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/dec/03/fine-young-cannibal-roland-gift-i-went-back-to-where-being-pretty-didnt-matter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Eastern Caribbean islands enjoy pleasant weather all year, but are also prone to tropical storms and hurricanes</p><p>Situated in the eastern Caribbean Sea, the Leeward Islands (and their more southerly counterparts, the Windward Islands) were so-named by the early Spanish and British explorers during the days of sail-power. The name derives from their geographical position relative to the direction of the wind. Today they form the northern islands of the Lesser Antilles chain, and include the Virgin Islands, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Montserrat and Guadeloupe.</p><p>Like much of the Caribbean region, the Leeward Islands have a very pleasant and equable climate: sunny and warm almost all-year-round, with very little difference in temperatures between winter and summer. The rainy season is from July through to November; though rain can and does fall in any month of the year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2020/dec/03/weatherwatch-the-climate-of-the-leeward-islands-caribbean-sea">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Academic Agnieszka Graff, lawyer Karolina Więckiewicz and gynaecologist Anna Parzyńska discuss their fight for abortion rights. An attempt by authorities to impose a near-total ban on terminations has sparked mass demonstrations across the country</p><p>On 22 October, Poland’s constitutional court ruled to ban abortions in cases of congenital foetal defects, even if the foetus has no chance of survival. The decision by the court’s 15 pro-ruling party judges, many of them appointed unlawfully, would allow terminations only in instances of rape, incest and when the mother’s life is at risk – a tiny fraction of cases. Women’s groups estimate that an additional 200,000 Polish women have abortions either illegally or abroad each year – Poland has some of Europe’s strictest abortion laws. </p><p>The ruling sparked an immediate reaction. Across the country, hundreds of thousands of demonstrators, mainly women and young people, took to the streets in the largest protest movement in the three decades since the fall of communism. The writer and activist <strong>Agnieszka Graff</strong> tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about the protests, and the influence the Catholic church has had on Poland’s increasingly restrictive abortion laws.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/dec/03/three-women-on-their-fight-for-abortion-rights-in-poland-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
