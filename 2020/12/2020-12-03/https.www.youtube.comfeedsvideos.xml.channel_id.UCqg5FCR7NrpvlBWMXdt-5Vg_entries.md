If I’m being perfectly honest, a lot of the missions in Watch Dogs: Legion kind of blend together for me. There are dozens that follow the very similar flow of going to a place, hacking some stuff, and then escaping said place. And while the gameplay is certainly a lot of fun and the “play as anyone” mechanic has the potential to be truly revolutionary, the scenarios themselves left me a bit wanting. That is — except for one mission. It’s called “Coming Home,” and it left me stunned at how expertly it broke away from the mold and delivered one of my most memorable gaming experiences of 2020.
