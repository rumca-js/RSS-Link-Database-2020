LYRICS

all of the lights
will fade into the dark of night
but all that aside
we'll be the ones who come alive

let's do it again
we can run into the dusk of dawn
time to pretend
it ain't that hard to carry on

there's nothing i can say
tonight
all i really know
it feels right

nothing i can do
so hold tight
all i really know
it feels right
it feels right
it feels right
it feels right

we're late for the show
yeah now the race is almost run
cause before you know
we'll set into the morning sun
let's do it again
we can run into the dusk of dawn
time to pretend
it ain't that hard to carry on

there's nothing i can say
tonight
all i really know
it feels right

nothing i can do
so hold tight
all i really know
it feels right
it feels right
it feels right
it feels right

there's nothing i can say
all i really know
nothing i can do
all i really know
it feels right, it feels right

there's nothing i can say
tonight
all i really know
it feels right

nothing i can do
so hold tight
all i really know
it feels right
it feels right
