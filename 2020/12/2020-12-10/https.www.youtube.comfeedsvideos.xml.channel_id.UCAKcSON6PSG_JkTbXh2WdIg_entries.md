Bon Iver is one of two acts (the other being Courtney Barnett) who hold the distinction of playing Rock the Garden more than once. Bon Iver's first appearance was in 2008, when Rock the Garden was rebooted following a four-year hiatus. In 2008, Bon Iver opened the show, which stands in stark contrast to 2017, when Bon Iver headlined the day. The Current's upcoming On-Air Fest, happening December 12 and 13, will feature live recordings of Bon Iver from Rock the Garden 2008 and 2017, along with an in-studio session cut. Watch two performances by Bon Iver from Rock the Garden 2017.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Holocene"
6:01 "22 (OVER S∞∞N)"

## Tegan and Sara - three songs at The Current (2010; 2016)
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZMld9ASDSk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZMld9ASDSk)

Tegan and Sara's recording careers started in 1997, when they used their school's recording studio to record their first demo. In 1999, the Canadian sisters independently released their debut LP, "Under Feet Like Ours." Their poppy, emotive indie-folk style attracted the attention of Neil Young's label Vapor Records, who signed them in 2000. Since that year, Tegan and Sara have released eight full-length albums, the most recent being 2019's "Hey, I'm Just Like You." Sisters Tegan and Sara Quin have visited The Current studio on a number of occasions, and we'll feature a selection of their live recordings in our upcoming On-Air Fest, happening December 12 and 13. Here are three of those live performances by Tegan and Sara at The Current.
