Cyberpunk 2077 has a robust character creator that allows you to make delicate tweaks to all aspects of your character, V. You can adjust your hair, skin tone, and skin type… but Cyberpunk 2077 offers plenty many more options beyond those.

In the above video, we select a lifepath and then create a custom V for our Cyberpunk 2077 journey. We cycle through most of the customization options the game has on offer, and adjust V's tattoos, cyberware location, and even their eyeballs--it is the future, after all. A huge talking point for Cyberpunk has been its genital options, but unfortunately we had to blur those, sorry--take it up with YouTube. We also take a quick look at V's core attributes, like intelligence, cool, and reflexes.

Cyberpunk 2077 launches on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Stadia on December 10, you can read GameSpot's review of CD Projekt Red's latest here.
