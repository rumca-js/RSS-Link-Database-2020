Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan are joined by actress Wendy Shapero, who you may know from Dirt, Free Samples, Robot Chicken, or the voice of the mom from our very own Babylon Bee animation. They talk about the week’s biggest stories like how our government is covering up aliens being among us, the vaccine being distributed through pyramid schemes, and how Santa’s Nice List has become compromised through software glitches. They also talk about how Kung Fu masters look to spread the gospel of the iron crotch, read hate mail, and wonder how many trendy food products Wendy will pitch to us before the show ends.

Kyle and Ethan from the Babylon Bee talk to Bridget Phetasy about the time she was on the show, Baggage, which was a Jerry Springer spin off show. She was able to get on after sharing her “baggage” of dealing with a heroin addiction and then hilarity ensued from the audience.
