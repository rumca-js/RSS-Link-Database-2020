<p>Justice secretary Robert Buckland breaks cabinet omertà by criticising controversial Barnard Castle visit</p><p>Dominic Cummings’s notorious trip to Barnard Castle in April was a “deeply unfortunate episode” that undermined the government’s coronavirus message, the justice secretary, Robert Buckland, has admitted.</p><p>Appearing on the BBC’s Question Time on Thursday, Buckland was asked by the host, Fiona Bruce, if he thought the former chief Downing Street adviser broke the guidelines.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/dec/10/top-tory-says-dominic-cummingss-trip-was-deeply-unfortunate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Research shows people who have a dog with type 2 diabetes are 38% more at risk of having disease themselves</p><p>It’s said that dogs resemble their owners, but the similarities may also extend to their risk of diabetes, research suggests. The same cannot be said of cat owners and their companions, however.</p><p>Previous studies had hinted that overweight owners tend to have porkier pets, possibly because of shared health behaviours such as overeating or not taking regular exercise. To investigate whether this extended to a shared risk of type 2 diabetes, Beatrice Kennedy, of Uppsala University in Sweden, and colleagues turned to insurance data from Sweden’s largest pet insurance company, using owners’ 10-digit national identification numbers to pull their anonymised health records.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/dec/10/dogs-owners-found-share-resemblance-diabetes-risk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tottenham marched into their final Europa <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/uefa-europa-league" title="">League</a> Thursday evening of the year with two simple objectives: to secure the victory that would place them as Group J victors and to do so while preserving key players ahead of a suffocating Christmas to come. In the end, they achieved both feats well enough, concluding as 2-0 winners over Royal Antwerp with second-half goals provided by Carlos Vinícius and Giovani Lo Celso.</p><p>Over their previous 19 games Tottenham’s only loss came against Royal Antwerp in Belgium six weeks ago, who finished as 1-0 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/oct/29/antwerp-tottenham-hotspur-europa-league-match-report" title="">winners</a> . It reflected perhaps the only thing that has not quite worked well for Spurs this season - the insipid performances when José Mourinho has attempted to rest his best players and rotate his team in Europa League away fixtures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/10/tottenham-royal-antwerp-europa-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The forward’s goals made him a national hero in 1982 after a two-year ban threatened to destroy his playing career</p><p>Paolo Rossi scored more than 150 goals in his career but if you wanted to understand the brilliance of a player whose death at the age of 64 sent Italy into mourning on Thursday, it may be enough to watch the one he grabbed in the 1982 World Cup final.</p><p>Or, more realistically, perhaps a slow-motion replay. The Italy striker does not appear to have position on his West Germany opponent Karlheinz Förster as Claudio Gentile prepares to send in a cross from the right. Only with repeat viewings does it become clear Rossi has started his run a frame or two sooner, building velocity, anticipating the delivery before it has even been dispatched. He beats Förster, and his own team-mate Antonio Cabrini, to the ball by a fraction, heading in from close range.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/dec/10/paolo-rossi-quick-feet-world-cup-joy-lives-on-tribute">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The EU is wise not to believe the prime minister. The result is a tragedy in the making for Britain</p><p>Boris Johnson got where he is today by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/jul/14/boris-johnson-brussels-bashing-stories-shaped-politics" title="">telling lies about Europe</a>. He made stories up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/10/boris-johnson-brussels-europe" title="">as a journalist</a>.

A good deal is there to be done, he told the Commons. But in the evening it was the very opposite. Mr Johnson arrived in Brussels to tell the EU that Britain was not ready to make a fisheries agreement, would never accept the European court of justice as the arbiter on future disputes, and could not agree to any form of agreement on trading standards that tied Britain’s hands to EU rules. The two sides now remain far apart, the Commons was told on Thursday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/dec/10/the-guardian-view-on-boris-johnson-in-brussels-not-to-be-trusted">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Hampstead theatre, London</strong><br />This revival of Harold Pinter’s two-hander about a pair of Beckettian hitmen raises questions for the age of strongman politics</p><p>There is an “amusing story” about the first performance of <a href="http://www.haroldpinter.org/plays/plays_room2.shtml">The Dumb Waiter at the Hampstead Theatre Club in 1960</a>, according to its director, James Roose-Evans. The run was packed out, he remembers, despite the disaster of Harold Pinter’s second play, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/02/theatre.samanthaellis">The Birthday Party</a>, which was cancelled after a week. But though this third play was a sensation, Roose-Evans says that “there were all these very smart people arguing about what it was about – what the play meant”.</p><p>We know better now not to expect clearcut motivations or meanings from this tight two-hander about hitmen waiting for their next job, and its 60th anniversary production at the same (renamed) venue seems to accentuate its deliberate enigmas.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/dec/10/the-dumb-waiter-review-pinters-enigma-picks-at-the-roots-of-power">Continue reading...</a>
