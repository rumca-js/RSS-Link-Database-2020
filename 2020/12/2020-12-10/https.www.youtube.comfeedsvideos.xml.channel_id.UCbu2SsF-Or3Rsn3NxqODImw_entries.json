You can adjust your hair, skin tone, and skin type\u2026 but Cyberpunk 2077 offers plenty many more options beyond those.\n\nIn the above video, we select a lifepath and then create a custom V for our Cyberpunk 2077 journey. We cycle through most of the customization options the game has on offer, and adjust V's tattoos, cyberware location, and even their eyeballs--it is the future, after all. A huge talking point for Cyberpunk has been its genital options, but unfortunately we had to blur those, sorry--take it up with YouTube. We also take a quick look at V's core attributes, like intelligence, cool, and reflexes.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 launches on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Stadia on December 10, you can read GameSpot's review of CD Projekt Red's latest here.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iX9mcdU6lGY", "date_published": "2020-12-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Game Awards 2020 Livestream", "description": "The Game Awards 2020 will be a special night for gaming, delivering new game announcements, musical performances, and plenty of awards.
