Charlie Brown Christmas was a staple of my childhood. Thought it would be cool to combine a couple of Guaraldi's classics to achieve ultimate nostalgia. The different time signatures made it tricky...high-fiving Ben Rose (producer and drummer) for helping me accomplish this mission. 

A mashup of Vince Guaraldi's "Christmas Time Is Here" & "Linus and Lucy" from "A Charlie Brown Christmas"

LYRICS

Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year

Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

Buh-da-da-da-da-da-da-daaaa
Buh-da-da-da
Buh-da-da-da-da-da-da-daaaa
Buh-da-daaa

Christmas time is here
We'll be drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

Buh-da-da-da-da-da-da-daaaa
Buh-da-da-da
Buh-da-da-da-da-da-da-daaaa
Buh-da-daaa

Christmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Oh, that we could always see 
Such spirit through the year
