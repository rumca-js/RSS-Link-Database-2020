They talk about the week\u2019s biggest stories like how our government is covering up aliens being among us, the vaccine being distributed through pyramid schemes, and how Santa\u2019s Nice List has become compromised through software glitches. They also talk about how Kung Fu masters look to spread the gospel of the iron crotch, read hate mail, and wonder how many trendy food products Wendy will pitch to us before the show ends.\n\nSubscribe on iTunes: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-babylon-bee/id1468715531\n\nGain Access to the Exclusive Content and Writing Forum: https://babylonbee.com/plans\n\nThe Official Babylon Bee Store: https://shop.babylonbee.com\n\nFollow The Babylon Bee:\nWebsite: https://babylonbee.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/thebabylonbee\nFacebook: http://facebook.com/thebabylonbee\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/thebabylonbee", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTK-fzX8-Rw", "date_published": "2020-12-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCyl5V3-J_Bsy3x-EBCJwepg", "title": "Bridget Phetasy Met Jerry Springer After Dealing With A Heroin Addiction", "description": "Kyle and Ethan from the Babylon Bee talk to Bridget Phetasy about the time she was on the show, Baggage, which was a Jerry Springer spin off show.
