With the butterfly keyboard gone, Apple's laptops are starting to look good once again. The Mac Pro is expensive but has a market. iMac Pro is looking a bit awkward and iMac is pretty good except a dated design. Boy, this sure is rambly isn't it? Gotta get them keywords though. We'll also talk a look at iPad Pro and it's upcoming Magic Keyboard for iPad Pro\u2014cursor support\u2014finally! iPhone 12 rumors as well as iPhone SE 2 or iPhone 9 rumors are going wild so I'm hopeful that things will turn at. All OLED screens, a smaller size, support for AR with the new LIDAR camera sensor, and more. This video is a fun one\u2014and I didn't proofread this at all\u2014so buckle up.
