The card is to be screened live in Britain on Sky Sports Racing and is expected to attract plenty of interest from fans of horse racing here, starved of local action for weeks and likely to remain so for some time.</p><p>The Guardian made a tentative initial foray into Hong Kong tipping on Wednesday\u2019s card at Happy Valley and found it entertaining without being especially rewarding, though the final winner spared our blushes. Sha Tin is not as sharp as Happy Valley, being a mile and a quarter around, and there is generally less trouble in running, though the draw can still play its part. There is a straight five-furlong course which can favour those drawn high, towards the stands\u2019 rail.</p> <a

The past week has been a disgrace. When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/eu-risks-break-up-over-coronabonds-row-warns-italian-pm\">ministerial talks</a> collapsed on Thursday over the plan for a \u201ccoronabond\u201d, the reaction seemed terminal. Germans and Dutch insulted Italians and Spaniards. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52224838\">said his country faced</a> an \u201ceconomic and social emergency\u201d, and the EU appeared not to care. The Danes <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52221259\">spoke of</a> \u201ca financial crisis on steroids\u201d. The European commission\u2019s vice-president, Frans Timmermans, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52211650\">predicted</a> \u201cthe EU as we know it will not survive this\u201d.</p><p>Finally a last-minute package was agreed, for \u20ac500bn of emergency loan finance. This was little more than an extension of the existing European stability mechanism, designed to help individual countries in short-term emergencies. Even then, it was a mere third of what the European Central Bank had <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-eurozone/ecb-urges-measures-worth-1-5-trillion-euros-this-year-to-tackle-virus-crisis-sources-idUKKBN21Q0U9\">said was needed</a>, \u20ac1.5tn euros. What was specifically not agreed was any sharing of the economic burden of the pandemic across European treasuries in general. It was mostly more loans.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-crisis-truth-eu-union-financial-rescue\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-crisis-truth-eu-union-financial-rescue", "date_published": "2020-04-10 12:47:11+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "My Twitter listening parties are like gigs - but nobody nicks your beer | Tim Burgess", "description": "<p>Every night, the likes of Oasis, Flaming Lips and the Cribs have been joining in as we listen to their albums in full.
