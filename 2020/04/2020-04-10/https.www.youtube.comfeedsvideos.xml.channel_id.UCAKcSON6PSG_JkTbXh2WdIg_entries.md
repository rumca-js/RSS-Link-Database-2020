Best Cost perform "Different Light" at The Current.

Bethany Consentino says, "I think part of what I've learned through my music and my lyrics is that, yeah, I've struggled with a lot of things, but I needed to go through all that stuff to come out on the other side."

From Best Coast's 2020 album, Always Tomorrow, available on Concord Records.

Best Coast perform "Everything Has Changed" at The Current.

"I think a lot of prior songs were a lot of me grappling with codependent relationships and toxic things in my life â€” not even necessarily romantic, but people, places, things in my life that were not good for me," Cosentino says. "And I feel like I was constantly going to battle for things that I should have learned years ago weren't worth going to battle for because they were just kind of keeping me in my sort of 'pool of darkness,' I suppose, if you want to call it that."

From Best Coast's 2020 album, Always Tomorrow, available on Concord Records.

Best Coast perform "For The First Time" at The Current.
