<p>French jockey Antoine Hamelin looks poised to make a big start to his hastily arranged career in the region</p><p>Antoine Hamelin may be able to make a dream start to his career in Hong Kong, having been handed the ride on <strong>Perfect Match</strong> (<strong>10.45am </strong>London time) in the Austin Handicap, the final and most valuable contest on Sunday’s fixture at Sha Tin. The card is to be screened live in Britain on Sky Sports Racing and is expected to attract plenty of interest from fans of horse racing here, starved of local action for weeks and likely to remain so for some time.</p><p>The Guardian made a tentative initial foray into Hong Kong tipping on Wednesday’s card at Happy Valley and found it entertaining without being especially rewarding, though the final winner spared our blushes. Sha Tin is not as sharp as Happy Valley, being a mile and a quarter around, and there is generally less trouble in running, though the draw can still play its part. There is a straight five-furlong course which can favour those drawn high, towards the stands’ rail.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/11/talking-horses-perfect-match-the-answer-to-hong-kongs-sunday-card">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On 10 April 1999 the King of Pop turned up and Fulham’s players were not dressed for the occasion when he came in after the match </p><p>On 10 April 1999, a little under two years since their takeover by Mohamed Al Fayed, Fulham were a third-tier club being propelled remorselessly upwards, running away with the league title – they were 16 points clear, with seven games to go – inspired by Kevin Keegan and rocket-fuelled by their owner’s chequebook.</p><p>Still, Keegan apart they were short of superstars. Their record transfer and most famous player was Chris Coleman – at £2.1m his was the highest fee paid by a third division club, a record beaten only when Sunderland signed Will Grigg 21 years later. The Welsh centre-back was a fine defender but not exactly box office, though they also had the Belgium international Philippe Albert, another centre-back, on loan from Newcastle. Hugh Grant, whose most successful film, Notting Hill, would be premiered in Leicester Square later that month, stood alone as their most famous fan. And then Michael Jackson turned up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/10/the-day-michael-jackson-visited-fulham-king-of-pop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Easter, Passover and spring itself are all about the renewal of life. Surrounded by sorrow and death, this brings solace</p><p>If this virus complied with the rules of ancient literature, it would have struck in the depth of winter. We would have been surrounded by bleakness and death just as nature had shrivelled up and the trees were stripped bare. But this plague refused to conform to any pathetic fallacy of our making, choosing instead to arrive with the spring. The news bulletins speak of a UK death toll of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/uk-daily-death-toll-to-surpass-900-for-first-time">nearly a thousand a day</a>. Outside your window, the sun is shining and there is blossom and bloom.</p><p>There is something cruel about that. Especially for those whose homes are cramped – an overcrowded flat, say, with no outside space, no room for a barbecue or paddling pool – a glimpse of blue sky and a warming sun might well be tantalising and taunting, a joy that is painfully out of reach. Even for those lucky enough to have a garden, it will seem perverse. Spring is about life and renewal, while all around is death and sorrow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/pandemic-easter-passover-renewal-death-hope">Continue reading...</a>

It seems absurd, now that everyone of advanced age and comorbidities has been told to see no one at all, but way back then (three weeks ago), this seemed reasonable. She immediately bartered the number up to six. It was like negotiating with Tony Soprano: there was no way she was coming out of the deal without the upper hand. Then I asked her how she planned to tell the rest of her associates that they weren’t on the list, and she said: “Good heavens, I’m not going to <em>tell </em>them. That would be so rude!”</p><p>Then the list was reduced to zero, but mysteriously, one of the original six went round anyway to fix her letterbox.

She said she would prefer to have less advice, and be given a lethal injection. “I wouldn’t mind,” she said, graciously. “I”m not sure whether the main impediment to euthanasia is whether or not you mind,” I observed, extremely calmly and not at all sarcastically.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/sunny-days-lockdown-furious-coronavirus-pandemic-rules">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s as if my mission brief was to stop my wife ever having a feeling of sexual desire for me again</p><p>I would never have described myself as vain. When I got my first standup spot on television, I returned home to find my wife and mother waiting to stage a hair intervention, immediately taking me to get it cut. I had apparently left it so long that my wife described my look as “recently released political prisoner”. Similarly with clothes: once we had children, I discovered that anything nice had a life expectancy of about an hour before one of them smeared ketchup, snot or a concoction that could only be identified by sending it to a lab, all over it, sometimes accidentally. So, for a long while, I just gave up on wearing nice stuff.</p><p>Since then, I have started to get my hair cut more frequently and make a sartorial effort. My wife would argue that I have gone too far the other way, as it is fair to say I have developed something of a trainer addiction. I recently wore a box-fresh pair of Yeezys to Chessington World of Adventures, which my wife and kids insisted would lead to the day being ruined by me crying over getting any kind of mark on them. Yeezys are the only fashion item I have ever possessed where, before deciding whether to wear them or not, I have to check the news to see if the designer, Kanye West, has said something twattish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/10/so-long-box-fresh-yeezys-from-now-on-wearing-gruffalo-slippers-and-boxers-romesh-ranganathan">Continue reading...</a>

Now the daily totals are approaching the 1,000 mark, we are down to one global email per day. It feels as if so many people are losing their individual identity and just becoming a statistic. So to redress the balance a little, I would like to tell you about Pete, who died of Covid-19 last weekend, the first person I have known to have died of the disease.

There is none more impressive than the human immune system, equipped as it is with a rich arsenal to defend against different types of pathogen. Viruses have evolved to trick, bypass and evade these defences. Our immune systems have, in turn, learned to recognise and deter these virus stealth tactics. In Covid-19, the enemy is a tiny piece of genetic material wearing a lipid coat and a protein crown.</p><p>So how is our immune system able to defend against viral infections, and how does this apply to Covid-19? The virus that causes Covid-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2), and was first detected in humans around five months ago. It is a coronavirus. “Corona”, in Latin, means crown. The virus is adorned with an outer layer of protein covered in spikes, like a crown. These spikes help the virus attach itself to target cells. The research community is<strong> </strong>fast learning about immunity to Covid-19, and we are also applying our knowledge of similar respiratory viruses to predict what to expect in this infection.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/heres-how-body-gains-immunity-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Attacked by Trump and ignored by many of its most powerful members, the World Health Organization is facing a major crisis – just at the moment we need it most. By Stephen Buranyi</p><p>If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.</p><p>Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How does half of stoner duo Cheech and Chong cope with coronavirus lockdown? Fine – thanks to drugs, his wife and the experience of nine months in prison for selling bong pipes</p><p>Tommy Chong has got the munchies. It’s early afternoon in locked-down LA, and last night he was on the pot cookies. “My wife, Shelby, just made a whole batch of them – oatmeal and maple syrup.” He stops to correct himself. “I put the pot in there, and of course I put too much in. Last night it got me almost comatose. Shelby got kinda mad at me. You know like when a kid gets so stoned all you do is sit there and grin.” Chong is 82 next month.</p><p>He sounds about four decades younger – his voice is deep, sexy, pulsing with life. Chong is one half of the most famous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/25/back-with-a-bong-why-we-need-stoner-movies-more-than-ever">stoner comic partnership in history, Cheech and Chong</a>. In the 1970s, they not only sold out their live shows, they topped the album charts and had huge box-office hits with movies such as Up in Smoke and Cheech and Chong’s Next Movie. The double-act were as radical as they were bonkers. And while the films were ostensibly about two aspiring rock stars in search of the next spliff, they introduced audiences to a downtown, multiracial Los Angeles rarely seen in movies.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/10/tommy-chong-interview-cheech-movies-stoner-quarantine">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New Zealand’s drive against Covid-19 is showing promise and it is not too late for other countries to follow</p><p>Epidemiologists love to evoke the memory of John Snow, who famously advocated removing the handle from the Broad Street pump in London, an action that helped to <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)60771-0/fulltext">end a severe outbreak of cholera</a>. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic we need to take the same kind of decisive action, yet western countries have appeared remarkably slow to do so, despite the advantages of immense scientific knowledge and modern tools of pandemic control.</p><p>New Zealand now appears to be the only “western” nation following an articulated elimination strategy with the goal of completely ending transmission of Covid-19 within its borders. The strategy appears to be working, <a href="https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-current-cases">with new case numbers falling</a>. Most cases are now returning travellers, who are safely quarantined at the borders, and the few remaining case clusters in the community are being traced and further spread stamped out. But it is far too soon to claim victory, and the country is remaining under an intense lockdown to support the elimination effort.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/elimination-what-new-zealands-coronavirus-response-can-teach-the-world">Continue reading...</a>
