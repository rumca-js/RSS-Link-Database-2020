No major story spoilers but I talk about Half Life: Alyx\u2019s gameplay at length.\n\nVirtual Reality finally has a game I think most can agree is a great game that has been made excellent in VR. I may not be a Half Life fan as such, but I have played Half Life 1 and 2, and Half Life: Alyx has made me fall in love with the series.\n\nHalf Life Alyx is without a doubt the best virtual reality game I have ever played, I compare it a lot to Boneworks and The Walking Dead: Saint and Sinners because I think it highlights where those games missed the mark a little, and what future games need to try and do to make VR really take off as a platform. \n\nI played Half Life: Alyx on the Index, but it seems to play just as well on the Vive. I would recommend the Index version as the Index has the best virtual Reality controllers I have used so far. \nAnyway, that\u2019s enough of me talking about VR, go get Half Life: Alyx if you can!\n\nAll my music and sound is from here: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/8pficg", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnwsL6BO8ls", "date_published": "2020-04-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
