It goes over how I use OBS on my Mac to use an external mirrorless Sony a6000 camera with a Cam Link 4K USB to HDMI adapter. I also use an external microphone for better audio quality, and a hotshoe LED light panel for better lighting and to add a catch light to my eyes.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9dSMAXHNDw", "date_published": "2020-04-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCR-DXc1voovS8nhAvccRZhg", "title": "Ansible 101 - Episode 3 - Introduction to Playbooks", "description": "Jeff Geerling (geerlingguy) dives deeper into Ansible, exploring the basic unit of automation, Ansible Playbooks.\n\nThis episode will follow material from chapters 3 and 4 in the bestselling Ansible book, Ansible for DevOps.\n\nBuy Ansible for DevOps:\u00a0https://www.ansiblefordevops.com\n\nSponsor Jeff on GitHub:\u00a0https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nSupport Jeff on Patreon:\u00a0https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\n\nContents:\n\n00:00:00 - Intro\n00:04:25 - Questions from last episode\n00:08:20 - Multi-host ad-hoc orchestration\n00:19:02 - Using different modules ad-hoc\n00:24:38 - Intro to Playbooks\n00:28:18 - Comparing to shell scripts\n00:32:35 - Moving commands into YAML playbooks\n00:39:28 - Making playbooks more Ansible-ish\n00:53:02 - Running the Apache playbook\n00:56:24 - Limiting playbook runs to specific servers\n01:00:14 - Outtro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNmKjtWtqIc", "date_published": "2020-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
