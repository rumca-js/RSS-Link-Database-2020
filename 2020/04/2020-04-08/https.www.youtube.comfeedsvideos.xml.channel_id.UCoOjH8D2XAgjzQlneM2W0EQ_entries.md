Let’s say you’re a political leader or an aspiring one of a country and you want more power
Because with more power, comes more money, more business
You want to bring back the good ol’ days of kings and queens and royalty
So we need to learn how to maneuver around the population
And what better example to learn how to master this skill than from the world’s second greatest economy - China

The enemy of the government is information
If you control the flow of information, you control the population
Controlling the internet is so important to China that they have an entire division of the government dedicated to it and have an entire industry that’s booming financially
Allow people to criticise the gov to give them the illusion of free speech, but don’t let them mobilize
Use the very clever Chinese tactic of flooding
Instead of outright censoring websites, use people’s impatience to your advantage

If you’re a US company and you want access to China’s 1.4 billion people to sell and market to, you have to kiss the ring
China offers Chinese tech startups the incentive of less competition
It’s citizens are put in a similar position. Things could be better, but our GDP per Capita, average income, and our overall quality of life has improved so much
We’re here to build an empire of subservient subjects - it will take some time

The culture of a society is the root of everything
It’s not the laws and institutions that influence the crowd, it’s the crowd’s culture that allows for the laws to be passed and for the institutions to act as they do
This is the hardest part of the equation bc changing a culture takes time
Luckily for China, their culture has already been rooted in the family instead of the individual for generations
If you’re able to solve this problem of culture, everything will fall into place with much less friction bc all the powers, censorship, surveillance, leverage, and puppet strings will just be an inevitable downstream of the culture you created
