Things could be better, but our GDP per Capita, average income, and our overall quality of life has improved so much\nWe\u2019re here to build an empire of subservient subjects - it will take some time\n\nThe culture of a society is the root of everything\nIt\u2019s not the laws and institutions that influence the crowd, it\u2019s the crowd\u2019s culture that allows for the laws to be passed and for the institutions to act as they do\nThis is the hardest part of the equation bc changing a culture takes time\nLuckily for China, their culture has already been rooted in the family instead of the individual for generations\nIf you\u2019re able to solve this problem of culture, everything will fall into place with much less friction bc all the powers, censorship, surveillance, leverage, and puppet strings will just be an inevitable downstream of the culture you created\n-----------------------\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
