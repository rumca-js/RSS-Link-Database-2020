My wife finally had enough of her fabric and sewing supplies living in piles and shelves all around our basement, so I was happy to help her consolidate into a new sewing area in the basement.

I had a notion she'd want to keep warm in the cold basement, so I re-insulated the joist bays using solid foam insulation (replacing old loose fiberglass batts), added a worklight with a motion sensing switch, added a new electrical circuit for her sewing machine and an iron, and then we put down some commercial remnant carpet squares.

It seams she enjoys the new sewing area.

I have been asked during my livestreams and by others who know my past history with live streaming major events how I do live streams, and if I can offer any advice for others live streaming on a budget.

I made this video to show how I do my livestreams, and also leave some advice for those who might be trying to improve the quality of their live streams after trying to just stream an event from a phone mounted on a tripod. It goes over how I use OBS on my Mac to use an external mirrorless Sony a6000 camera with a Cam Link 4K USB to HDMI adapter. I also use an external microphone for better audio quality, and a hotshoe LED light panel for better lighting and to add a catch light to my eyes.
