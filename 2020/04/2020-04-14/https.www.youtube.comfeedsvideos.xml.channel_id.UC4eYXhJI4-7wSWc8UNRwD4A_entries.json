Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nApril 14, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- On the raw video Kevin Morby and Katie Crutchfield (aka Waxahatchee) sent to us, Kevin takes a deep breath, gives a sweet smile as he looks into his camera, clasps his hands, and says, \"Hello everyone, we're going stir crazy \u2014 this is take number 55.\" The performance, though, feels fresh and relaxed. Recorded at Kevin's tiny desk in Kansas City, they play two songs from Waxahatchee's new album Saint Cloud, sing together on Kevin's 2016 tune \"Beautiful Strangers,\" and find new meaning in the late Jason Molina's song \"Farewell Transmission.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Fire\"\n\"Beautiful Strangers\"\n\"Lilacs\"\n\"Farewell Transmission (Songs: Ohia Cover)\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NArUd2vMgA8", "date_published": "2020-04-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
