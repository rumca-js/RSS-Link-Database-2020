Here's everything you need to know about Chimera Squad, from playable aliens to permadeath.\n\nXCOM developer Firaxis announced a new game in the series, and it's coming to PC via Steam very soon. Chimera Squad launches on April 24, and it'll cost you $10 on day one--the price will jump up to $20 on May 1, however.\n\nChimera Squad is a spin-off, not a sequel. It's set five years after the events of XCOM 2 XCOM 2 and changes up the series' gameplay quite a bit. Perhaps most significantly, it removes permadeath: your mission will simply restart if a squad member bleeds out. You can learn more about Chimera Squad and its key differences in the video above.\n\n#XCOM #ChimeraSquad #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RqYsF09PbQ", "date_published": "2020-04-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "How To Remap Your Switch Joy-Con Buttons", "description": "Nintendo Switch system update 10.0.0 is out now, and its biggest feature is the option to remap your Joy-Con button inputs.
