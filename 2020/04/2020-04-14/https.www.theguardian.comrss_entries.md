<p>This year’s Derby could take place away from Epsom and on a different weekend – for the first time in its 240-year history </p><p>When is a Derby not a Derby any more? It is a question that racing’s planners, executives and fans seem sure to be asking themselves over the next few weeks as the sport plots what seems sure to be a very slow return to some kind of normality when the lockdown starts to ease. What, if anything, can be done to save British Flat racing’s most famous Classic?</p><p>There has been a Derby winner every year since Diomed’s success in the first running of the race in 1780. The first four Derbys were staged over a mile but it switched to 12 furlongs from 1784 and all but 10 of the 240 horses to win the Derby since 1780 did so at Epsom in either late May or early June.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/talking-horses-new-day-new-track-but-would-it-still-be-the-derby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Kim Kardashian to Selena Gomez, the perceived trend for wanting to appear black shows no sign of slowing down </p><p>On Monday night Interview magazine dropped their new cover on Instagram – a hyper-urban shot of singer<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7BEWRBkVD/"> Selena Gomez</a> with her tongue sticking out, dressed in black boots, leggings and a Balenciaga X-Rated top. On her head the singer sported a braided hairstyle with baby-hair edges. The hispanic Gomez also appeared to have a darker complexion than she would normally have. “She is done letting people control her narrative,” the magazine wrote in the caption below. And yet the cover image styling appeared to show the singer appropriating from another culture completely. “This is blackfishing y’all wake up,” read one comment under the cover image, while the website <a href="https://twitter.com/popcreave/status/1249698482673397760">Pop Crave</a> tweeted the question: “Why is Selena Gomez trying to be black …” – featuring pictures from the Interview shoot.</p><p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0; padding: 0 4px;"> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7BEWRBkVD/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" style="color: #000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; line-height: 17px; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">At just 27, @selenagomez is a global pop star, a tabloid fixture, a documentary and TV producer—and a philanthropist who has shifted her attention to coronavirus relief efforts.

<p>The director of the acclaimed Diego Maradona documentary on the Argentina legend and his love of Liverpool</p><p>For most of us it feels like a lifetime ago but just over three weeks have passed since the UK went into social lockdown. Friday 20 March to be precise – the day it was announced all cafes, pubs and restaurants had to shut because of coronavirus and everyone in the country realised they were in for many, <em>many</em> nights stuck in front of the television.</p><p>So began the search for things to watch and for football lovers quick relief came on that first Saturday when Channel Four showed Diego Maradona, the critically acclaimed documentary by director Asif Kapadia. I’d seen it at a screening in central London 10 months earlier and found myself nodding in agreement as praise for the film filled social media. Kapadia witnessed the outpouring too and even for a man who has been there, done that and got the Oscar, there was satisfaction to be taken from the way his work was being received.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/14/asif-kapadia-jurgen-klopp-is-honest-passionate-and-cares-i-love-him">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Club with no full-time players have won promotion but will not be changing their ethos or their pay structure<br /></p><p>Richmond’s return to the Championship is a parable for the most challenging period rugby has faced. A club that do not have contracts with their players and whose priority is the organisation and everyone involved in it rather than the first team stood alone the last time they were first promoted to English rugby’s second tier three years ago. But their model is set to be copied by others as the financial impact of the coronavirus lockdown deepens.</p><p>“The finances of the Championship simply don’t work,” says Steve Hill, Richmond’s director of rugby for the past 10 years and first-team head coach. “With the cuts to it that will be made by the Rugby Football Union, more clubs will have to look at our model. Outside Ealing Trailfinders, who have a wealthy backer, virtually all are losing money and it cannot continue. You do not want clubs going out of existence but we are in danger of that happening as things stand.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/14/richmond-may-be-sustainable-model-for-the-future-of-championship-rugby">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My family is house-sharing with my husband’s brother during the pandemic. I’m worried our mutual attraction could go too far<br /></p><p><strong>Because of the coronavirus, I am </strong><strong>staying </strong><strong>in my late mother’s home with my husband, his brother and wife, and our young children. This </strong><strong>seemed like a good idea, so we could share chores and childcare (two of us are still </strong><strong>working, from home, full time</strong><strong>). But the situation has become uncomfortable for me because I am extremely attracted to my brother-in-law. I</strong><strong> had </strong><strong>hoped this feeling would die down, </strong><strong>but it</strong><strong> has </strong><strong>got</strong><strong> worse</strong><strong> and over the past three weeks I have become aware that he seems to be lusting after me. My husband and I rarely have sex, </strong><strong>owing to his </strong><strong>lack of interest, which </strong><strong>set in after our second child was born, so I am frustrated and afraid that something</strong><strong> is going to happen, or that others in the house will pick up on the vibe between us. How can I stop this feeling?</strong></p><p>Under normal circumstances, erotic tension is increased when there is an obstacle to acting on it. But now you have an extra challenge, because courting danger in non-virus-related ways is a common behaviour during this time. Like many others, you may be unconsciously drawn to a peril that you can control. Recognise this and set firm boundaries. Do your best never to be alone in a room with your brother-in-law. Stop fantasising about him. Increase your bonds with his wife and children. Work to improve your relationship with your husband and try to reawaken your sex life together. Focus on your children, on establishing routine, exercising, calming your mind and keeping your family safe. All this shall pass.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/14/i-am-extremely-attracted-to-my-brother-in-law-and-now-were-locked-down-together">Continue reading...</a>

But the industry is on the precipice of oblivion: most restaurants in the UK are closed, and those that have switched to takeaway and delivery know it’s merely a sticking plaster. In London, the country’s food metropolis, the shutters are down from Soho to the Old Kent Road.</p><p>As this became clear, my first reaction was to go into cheerleader mode: pick up pom-poms and shout that this great industry needs to be bailed out at any cost.

## Radical Wordsworth by Jonathan Bate review  – fleet-footed and inspiriting

<p>On the 250th anniversary of his birth, a biography focusing on the poet’s most creative years zings with passion and energy</p><p>In 1798, William Wordsworth arrived from Bristol at the cottage of his friend, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, in Nether Stowey in Somerset. Twenty-five years later, William Hazlitt, who was also in residence at the time, still remembered his first sight of the future poet laureate, a tall “Don Quixote-like” figure, quaintly dressed in a brown fustian jacket and striped pantaloons. There was, wrote Hazlitt, “a roll in his gait” and a “fire in his eye”; when he began to talk, he heard in Wordsworth’s voice “a strong tincture of the northern burr, like the crust on wine”. The poet “instantly began to make havoc” of a Cheshire cheese that was on Coleridge’s table.</p><p>The year 1798 was a miraculous one for Coleridge and Wordsworth, their glorious bromance as yet unpolluted by jealousy and opium (Coleridge), pomposity and indiscretion (Wordsworth). There, on the edge of the Quantocks – they were not yet the Lakeland Poets – Wordsworth wrote <em>Tintern Abbey</em> and Coleridge <em>Kubla Khan</em> and <em>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>. Striding out in the countryside, accompanied by Wordsworth’s sister, Dorothy, they talked of Shakespeare and Spinoza, their brains, like their lungs, expanding with every stride. The atmosphere, all poetry and high-mindedness, was exciting, even febrile. But Britain was also at war with France, and young men of odd appearance and grand ideas were apt to attract attention. Word of their activities having reached the wrong ears, a government spy was dispatched to observe them. What this emissary made of Wordsworth’s striped pantaloons is, alas, not known.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/14/radical-wordsworth-by-jonathan-bate-review-fleet-footed-and-inspiriting">Continue reading...</a>

And yet, like a phoenix, it rises, every time stronger than before. The appetite for its product is insatiable especially in times of political trouble and uncertainty about the future. People want to escape. They want to be entertained.</p><p>The way we make movies most certainly must change. In the best of circumstances, we are a crew of 75 people jammed into a room with very little ventilation, holding our breath until we hear “CUT”. We are in close contact with one another all day long. We never really thought about it before. All of that is about to change. Film sets usually function as big families, and moving forward, that family unit will take on a stronger, protective meaning.

<p>The crisis has brought the economy to a near halt, and left millions of people out of work. But thanks to intervention on an unprecedented scale, a full-scale meltdown has been averted – for now. By Adam Tooze</p><p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world’s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p><p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations – known in the new slang of March 2020 as “<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs" title="">Rona rigs</a>” – screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets.

## Grains of truth: what the flour shortage tells us about who we are

<p>The current crisis has prompted a rush on baking ingredients. It shows the daily loaf retains its ancient, essential role – providing sustenance, social bonding and satisfaction</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>After the early and unedifying bog-roll panic, the real shortage of the pandemic became clear: flour. Dried yeast, inevitably, was the next casualty. Price gougers on eBay were quick off the mark; by the middle of last week, a 1.5kg bag of plain flour (usually about £1.50) was going for £19. A pot of yeast (normally 98p) was almost a tenner. As supermarket shelves emptied, corner shops came into their own. They had stocked these store-cupboard essentials all along – who knew?</p><p>The problem is partly operational. About 96% of flour from large millers is produced in bulk for bakers and food manufacturing, and that demand has stayed relatively stable. Demand from home bakers may have doubled, but since it was only 4% of the total, it is not the flour that is lacking so much as the ability to package smaller units in greater numbers. Across the country, most mills are running at full capacity, 24 hours a day. They are producing 4m bags a week, whereas previously they were producing 2m – yet it is still not enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/14/grains-flour-shortage-tells-us-about-who-we-are">Continue reading...</a>
