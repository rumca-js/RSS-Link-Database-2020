Twenty-five years later, William Hazlitt, who was also in residence at the time, still remembered his first sight of the future poet laureate, a tall \u201cDon Quixote-like\u201d figure, quaintly dressed in a brown fustian jacket and striped pantaloons. There was, wrote Hazlitt, \u201ca roll in his gait\u201d and a \u201cfire in his eye\u201d; when he began to talk, he heard in Wordsworth\u2019s voice \u201ca strong tincture of the northern burr, like the crust on wine\u201d.

Striding out in the countryside, accompanied by Wordsworth\u2019s sister, Dorothy, they talked of Shakespeare and Spinoza, their brains, like their lungs, expanding with every stride. The atmosphere, all poetry and high-mindedness, was exciting, even febrile. But Britain was also at war with France, and young men of odd appearance and grand ideas were apt to attract attention. Word of their activities having reached the wrong ears, a government spy was dispatched to observe them.

Dried yeast, inevitably, was the next casualty. Price gougers on eBay were quick off the mark; by the middle of last week, a 1.5kg bag of plain flour (usually about \u00a31.50) was going for \u00a319.

About 96% of flour from large millers is produced in bulk for bakers and food manufacturing, and that demand has stayed relatively stable. Demand from home bakers may have doubled, but since it was only 4% of the total, it is not the flour that is lacking so much as the ability to package smaller units in greater numbers.
