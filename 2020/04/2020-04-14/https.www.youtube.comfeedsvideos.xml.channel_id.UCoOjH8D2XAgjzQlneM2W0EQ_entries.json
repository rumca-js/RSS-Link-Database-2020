You know how to spend their money better than they do, their money is better off in your hands.\nYou want more money for troubling times, when everyone was too irresponsible to prepare\nThey\u2019ll instinctually look to the government for help. If you don\u2019t offer any welfare, they\u2019ll blame on you\nBut if you had money on your hands, you'll have the ability to give them some welfare, stimulus checks, unemployment insurance and benefits, some grants\nThe main way to make money is from taxes, but can't tax too much\nIf you could print free money, you'd get the same result as taxing. \nThe idea of the gov printing as much money as they want just doesn't sound right and reminds people of hyperinflation in places like Germany, Venezuela, Zimbabwe\nEnter - the Federal Reserve - America\u2019s money printer\n\nThe Panic of 1907 happened: stock market dropped almost 50%, there were bank runs, banks and small and large businesses declared bankruptcy\n\nIn 1910, you go to Jekyll Island with your five guests\nAssistant secretary of the US treasury Heads of the most powerful banks at the time, National City Bank of New York, JP Morgan, and Kuhn, Loeb & Company\n\nBig bankers:\nSmall banks were popping up all over, the big banks in New York were losing of market share to competition\nInterest rates at the time were set by the free market, which meant less profits\nTo make more money as a bank, more risk, lend out more of your depositors\u2019 money, but you didn\u2019t have gov bailouts and stimulus packages\nThe Federal Reserve system was born\n\nYou can\u2019t just say \u201cWe\u2019re gonna print $2 trillion dollars today!\u201d\nCalling it something more technical: \nDiscount Window, Open Market Operations, changing the reserve ratio, Quantitative Easing\nAnything that doesn\u2019t allude to \u201cWe\u2019re inflating the money supply & making your money less valuable\u201d\n\nGov Debt: the gov takes out loans as treasury notes or bonds\nThis debt forms the foundation for nearly all of the nation\u2019s money supply\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
