Murphy says the only numbers he has total faith in are the Australian numbers, because \u201cwe have the highest testing rate in the world\u201d (Trump has also claimed this mantle). </p><p>I think China is in a really difficult position. They did clamp down incredibly hard and they stopped transmission. But their population is not immune. They still have a lot of people in their population and they are, obviously, trying very hard to prevent second waves. I think they have been pretty transparent but as I said, I\u2019m only confident about our numbers. <strong>I\u2019m certainly not confident even the numbers out of the US are much higher than being reported because nobody else in the world has been doing testing like we have. </strong>Nobody else in the world got on to all those original cases out of Wuhan in January and contained them. That\u2019s why we are now dealing with what we know rather than a huge community transmission that happened all through February in countries like Italy and the US. We\u2019re on top of our cases. But we still have a long way to go.</p><p>At the current rate if we keep doing what we\u2019re doing and keep doing the work to upgrade ICU capacity and secure the extra ventilators then right now that trajectory is promising, it\u2019s encouraging, but there are no guarantees.
