<p>The strict UK lockdown means that this virtual race could pull in more viewers than the actual Aintree spectacular could</p><p>Around lunchtime on Saturday, somebody somewhere will hit “enter” on their keyboard and, a fraction of a second and many millions of calculations later, it will generate the result of the 2020 Virtual Grand National. A few hours after, many millions of viewers – more, perhaps, than might have watched the real thing – will tune in to ITV to watch as the computer’s thought processes get the full CGI treatment and its calculation becomes (virtual) reality.</p><p>If algorithms are not your thing, think of it as the rolling of a 100-sided dice, with Tiger Roll’s name on about 16 of the faces and the other 39 virtual horses distributed around the remaining 84 faces in proportion to the computer’s idea of their chance. Poor old Double Shuffle, at 100-1, is only there once, but in the unlikely event that his name does come up, it should guarantee a healthy return for NHS Charities Together, which will receive all bookmakers’ profits on the virtual race.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/04/talking-horses-millions-will-tune-in-for-itv-virtual-grand-national-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Parasitic roundworms can infect lambs with a potentially fatal disease. Accurate localised weather forecasts allow farmers to move lambs to safer pastures</p><p>At this time of year, sheep farmers in the UK start keeping an eye on a website linked to local weather stations making forecasts: not of rain or sun, but parasites.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.moredun.org.uk/research/diseases/nematodirus">Nematodirus</a></em> or thread-necked worms, are parasitic roundworms that infect lambs when they start eating grass. The infection is usually mild, but lambs ingesting large numbers of worm larvae can suffer severely, with a mortality rate of up to 30%. <em>Nematodirus</em> hatching is triggered by specific weather conditions. A cold snap followed by several days of temperatures of 10C or more will produce mass hatching and extremely dangerous conditions. This tends to be in April or May in southern England, but might be in June in Scotland, with a local variation due to differences in microclimate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/03/weatherwatch-parasite-forecast-allows-lambs-to-safely-graze">Continue reading...</a>

The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/jeremy-corbyn-says-still-working-21787329">recent attacks</a> on him for appearing in the House of Commons and working in his Westminster office during the crisis at the age of 70, despite official advice that older people should stay at home, have in a sense taken the years of assaults on his legitimacy to their logical conclusion. To many of his critics, Corbyn has no right to exist as a significant public figure.</p><p>Yet this drastic shrinking of his status has also coincided, thanks to the crisis, with a huge expansion of what governments do. And expanding the state’s role in society and the economy is what much of Corbyn’s career has been devoted to. Corbynism was – and is – primarily a politics about addressing emergencies: the stark inadequacies of modern capitalism, the damage caused by austerity, and the accelerating effects of the climate crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/labours-new-leader-corbynism-more-relevant">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The abject failure of the administration has magnified this crisis.

To hit the lowest end of the target, a staggering 100,000 American deaths, would show that his administration had done “a very good job”, Donald Trump claimed this week. The highest end would be more than double the US casualties in the first world war.

## Boris Johnson will be judged on the next four weeks. That prospect should frighten him | Jonathan Freedland

<p>The British public are being patient over the coronavirus crisis, but they will not forgive governmental confusion for ever</p><p>Boris Johnson and his government are on probation, watched by a public whose mood could turn rapidly and brutally. For now, and on paper, Johnson has the people with him: his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-28/coronavirus-gives-boris-johnson-s-political-immunity">poll ratings</a> have surged north of 50%, a feat last managed by a Tory government at the height of the Falklands war nearly 40 years ago. But the wisest heads in Downing Street will not be turned by those numbers. They know that there’s always a “rally around the flag” effect at moments of extreme crisis: when citizens are frightened, they want to believe their leaders have got things under control. That’s why incumbents around the world, even useless and immoral ones <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/trump-narcissism-american-blood-coronavirus">such as Donald Trump</a>, have enjoyed an initial corona bounce in their ratings, almost regardless of their actions. At the start of the Iran hostage crisis in 1979 Jimmy Carter saw his approval numbers <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/survey-finds-carters-popularity-has-risen-sharply-in-iran-crisis.html">leap from 32% to </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1979/12/10/archives/survey-finds-carters-popularity-has-risen-sharply-in-iran-crisis.html">61%</a> – only for him to crash to defeat a year later. Johnson will know that one day, and perhaps quite soon, he, too, will be judged.</p><p>He can point to some concrete achievements. The opening today of what is a giant field hospital in east London’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video">Ex</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video">CeL </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/03/prince-charles-opens-nhs-nightingale-hospital-for-coronavirus-patients-video">centre</a>, constructed within nine days, is the prime example. Those who drooled with totalitarian envy at China’s ability to throw up a hospital in Wuhan within a week were adamant that a western democracy like Britain could never match that accomplishment, and they have been proved wrong. Rishi Sunak’s promise that the state will pay <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/government-pay-wages-jobs-coronavirus-rishi-sunak">80% of workers’ wages</a> has won plaudits around the world, even if the chancellor has had to return repeatedly to his economic rescue package, tweaking it to catch those groups he left behind first time around. And the government has imposed a national lockdown that has been largely observed, one that might even see a flattening of the infection curve in the next week or so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/boris-johnson-judged-coronavirus-confusion">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Working with him was all adrenaline': Rory Bremner on writer John Langdon

<p>The comedian looks back on the brilliant, pun-packed career of his friend, writing partner and master of the one-liner <br /></p><p>You may not know the name John Langdon, who died on 23 March, but you’ll very probably have laughed at his jokes or even read his pun-packed posters on the London Underground in the 1980s. When the story of BBC Radio Light Entertainment is written, the legend of Langdon will feature large, not least because he wrote the famous Week Ending sketch about Derek Jameson (“a man who thinks erudite is a type of glue”) for which the tabloid editor sued the BBC and lost. But to me, he was my best friend, my greatest encourager and, for over 35 years, my constant writing partner.</p><p>He’d appreciate the irony of now being the late John Langdon, as that was a salient part of his reputation – his inability to deliver scripts on time, or rather, his infallible ability to produce far too many jokes at the very last minute. “Do you want it funny or do you want it Friday?” he’d say, knowing that producers invariably wanted it Friday. But he, equally invariably, managed, through a combination of chaotic genius and perfectionism, to push it into the small hours of Saturday. One producer blamed the break-up of his marriage on the fact that his wife wouldn’t believe him when he insisted he was working late editing John’s scripts and decided he must be having an affair. Barry Cryer would say John was like Brigadoon, the Scottish village that appeared out of the mist one day every 100 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/03/rory-bremner-on-writer-john-langdon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Virtual expedition team ascends 5,364 metres over five days in indoor mountain climbing challenge </p><p>April in Nepal usually means thousands of trekkers trudging up to Everest base camp. This spring the mountain is free of crowds but the trekkers are still trudging – up stairs, back steps, even up ladders in a virtual push to reach an altitude of 5,364 metres. Led by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rorysouthworth/?hl=en">trail runner Rory Southworth</a>, a team of about 30 climbers will reach their target this evening after five days of climbing.</p><p>Southworth decided to organise a group challenge after receiving positive feedback online for three solo hikes during the first week of lockdown. “I did Snowdon on my bottom step; Ben Nevis on the seven stairs down to my garden; and ran up the hill at the back of my garden 29 times to scale Scafell Pike. For this challenge, I wanted to bring people with me on the journey.

When I get to his age I hope that I’m as much of a legend as he is.” However, this week I have run towards the midlife crisis with my arms open wide, ready to embrace it, move in with it, and resent it as the early magic of the relationship wanes. This week, I bought DJ equipment.</p><p>I am not saying that I am too old to DJ.

Still, we were determined to make it happen. Just as soon as the time was right. But we do not live in right times, we live in wrong times; a perpetual state of uncertainty where each year there is another emergency (climate, political, medical, all of the above), and another personal battle to fight fire in.</p><p>Eventually, a right-enough time did arrive.
