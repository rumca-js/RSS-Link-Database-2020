Celebrities during the quarantine are an inspiration to us all. How they talk down to us, telling us how to live, and empathizing on how hard things are as they're trapped on their multi-million dollar estates. And Gal Gadot singing her condescending, cringe worthy version of Imagine is gonna help pull us all through this difficult crisis.
