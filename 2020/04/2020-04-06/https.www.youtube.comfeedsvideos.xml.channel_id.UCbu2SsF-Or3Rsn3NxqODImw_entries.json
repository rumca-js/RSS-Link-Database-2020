Running from April 7-21, the update is bringing a map change and a batch of new cosmetics.\n\nThat map change is a town takeover, adding a prowler enclosure to World's Edge where you'll find both antagonistic animals and high-tier loot. The Old Ways also offers a series of challenges you can complete to unlock new cosmetics, two of which are recolored versions of skins that were previously available during Season 1's Legendary Hunt. In fact, all the cosmetics from that event can be obtained during The Old Was if you missed them the first time around.\n\nThe game overall will see some changes outside of the event. Apex Legends is permanently adding duos as a game option, and you'll also be able to choose to drop on either World's Edge or King's Canyon. There's more info on all of this in the video above.\n\n#ApexLegends #TheOldWays #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Fgy_P5mzaY", "date_published": "2020-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare & Warzone - Official Season 3 Trailer", "description": "Take it to the next level.\n\nExperience Season 3 including old friends, bigger squads, fresher rides, and more.

Here's why it's in your best interest to see them through.\n\nWe know, we know! You\u2019ve been waiting 15 years for the remake of Final Fantasy 7 and you can\u2019t wait to speed through the whole thing to satisfy that insatiable nostalgia of yours, but take a deep breath and trust your ol\u2019 pal GameSpot on this one, because you\u2019re going to want to complete every side mission you can. Here\u2019s why.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7, when it released 23 years ago, spent a good chunk of time in Midgar, running you through an overview of the world, the story, and it\u2019s characters, but because it was such a big game, you had to spread your one-wing eventually and fly away, relegating the city of Midgar to only some late game shenanigans. \n\nThis time around, the iconic locale plays a much larger role in the story and gives your party members more personal time to shine. In the remake, after entering the Sector 7 Slums and completing some chores with Tifa, you can either go to sleep--like a total chump--or become the most badass merc on the market by helping out some of the local shop owners and neighborhood watch. Some of these tasks might have you rounding up lost cats or exterminating some were-rats, and while this labor might seem menial in the moment, you\u2019ll find that the time you spend one-on-one with Tifa, talking about your history together, the state of the world, and Avalanche\u2019s role in it, really fleshes out her character\u2019s motivations and life in the slums. As her endless onslaught of affection slowly chips away at Cloud\u2019s cold exterior, you see him start to expose some of the vulnerabilities we normally wouldn\u2019t see until halfway through the original, culminating in an optional story encounter we won\u2019t spoil here. \n\nBut if emotions aren\u2019t your thing, don\u2019t worry, we haven\u2019t forgotten about you! By completing these side-missions, you can get your hands on some crucial early game upgrades to your armor, or in a different part of town later on, even receive weapons you won\u2019t find anywhere else--at least that we\u2019ve found so far. \n\nIf the specifics aren\u2019t enticing enough already, then how about the thrill of earning some cold, hard, cash? Once you slay a couple of monsters for the neighborhood watch, you\u2019re going to want to spend all this gil you\u2019re getting on some new pieces of armor from the weapons shop that provide bonus materia slots. Equip all the materia you possibly can, because the only way they level them up is if they\u2019re slotted into your weapons and armor! While you\u2019re at it, buy another healing materia spell as well, so you can stack your party with options in a struggle. \n\nLastly, you may find a slightly unsettling boy on the streets named Chadley. I know every instinct in your body will tell you to run away and not look back, but believe me, he\u2019s got an offer you can\u2019t refuse. I mean, maybe you can, but don\u2019t. Chadley gives you the Assess materia, and after using the ability during combat to scan for weaknesses, Chadley will develop new forms of materia for you, and later on, provide you with opportunities to fight Summons in VR so you can add them to your growing stockpile. The earlier you start helping Chadley, the faster you get access to some super strong Materia, like Synergy or Shiva.\n\nWe won\u2019t spoil the next round of side-missions, but rest assured, they\u2019re well worth your while if you\u2019re trying to get your hands on a fan-favorite weapon, or watch as Cloud wallows his way through the Midgar gig economy with a fan-favorite character. We hope you heeded our warning, and if not, be sure to check out all our other coverage of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake.\n\n#FinalFantasy #FF7 #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciaRtV8HqSg", "date_published": "2020-04-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
