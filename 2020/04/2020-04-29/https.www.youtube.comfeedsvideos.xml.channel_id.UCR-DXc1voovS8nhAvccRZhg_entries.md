In this video, I introduce the concept of Raspberry Pi clustering, and cluster computing in general. Technology like Beowulf clusters and Kubernetes has made it easy to build clusters using off-the-shelf components.

I walk through how I built my 'Pi Dramble' (https://www.pidramble.com) over the years using various Raspberry Pi model B computers, and I compare a set of Raspberry Pis to a giant 'ThreadRipper' CPU, leading up to an introduction to the Turing Pi, a game-changing Raspberry Pi-based cluster board.
