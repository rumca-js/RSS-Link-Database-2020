Called Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the game is scheduled to get a brand-new trailer very soon.\n\nIf you missed out on the livestream or couldn't watch the whole thing (because, again, it was eight hours long), we have you covered. The video above is a sped-up timelapse of the complete stream, condensing the entire experience into five minutes. That's a little bit more manageable in our opinion.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is scheduled to release this year, though an exact launch date hasn't been announced yet--Ubisoft hasn't revealed which systems the game is coming out for either, though it's a good bet we'll see the game on Xbox One, PS4, PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5.\n\nGiven the time period--The Viking Age started in the ninth century and continued through to the eleventh--it's likely Valhalla will continue the origin story of the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order, which began in Assassin's Creed Origins and continued in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. The Viking Age actually ends just before the events of the original 2007 Assassin's Creed.\n\n#AssassinsCreed #Valhalla #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSTuUqSZXTE", "date_published": "2020-04-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Evolution of Assassin\u2019s Creed Gameplay - From The Holy Land To Valhalla", "description": "With the announcement that Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla is taking us to the Viking Age, let\u2019s take a look back at how the gameplay of Ubisoft\u2019s flagship franchise has evolved over time. From early days of Altair's social stealth, to Ezio's city renovations, Edward's naval combat, Bayek's Eagle Vision, and beyond. Let\u2019s delve into the Animus and explore the series major gameplay evolutions.\n\nWith the announcement of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Ubisoft's popular history-based franchise dives into The Viking Age, which occurred between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Funnily enough, that's right before the events of 2007's Assassin's Creed, the game that started this massive franchise in the first place--meaning Ubisoft has almost gone full circle.\n\nOr at least it has in terms of its story. When it comes to gameplay, the franchise as a whole has been a steady evolution. What started as a stealth-driven action game has now become a franchise defined by its massive open worlds and action-focused combat. In the video above, Lucy James details this full transformation, describing how the mechanics and features of Assassin's Creed have changed since 2007.\n\nFull disclosure: the video only covers the mainline entries of Assassin's Creed. That means we skip over handheld titles (like Assassin's Creed Pirates and Assassin's Creed Rebellion) and spin-offs (such as Assassin's Creed III: Liberation and Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China). It's not that those games haven't contributed long-term gameplay traditions or storybeats too, but this video is already over 10 minutes long--it would be a monstrous task to cover all 22 Assassin's Creed games.\n\nSide note: Can you believe that there have been 22 (soon to be 23) Assassin's Creed games in 13 years?

Additionally, since Gears Tactics is a Gears of War game, the enemies you encounter behave like they do in the rest of the franchise--encouraging you to go up against them with similar strategies.\n\nIn GameSpot's Gears Tactics review, Mike Epstein wrote, \"Though Gears Tactics wears itself a little thin by the end of its protracted campaign, the rush of pulling together a victory from the jaws of defeat carries an exciting, chaotic energy. Unlike most strategy games, playing well doesn't necessarily make you feel like a mastermind, so much as though you've cheated death. Every successful plan, even a last-ditch effort, feels like a small stroke of genius.
