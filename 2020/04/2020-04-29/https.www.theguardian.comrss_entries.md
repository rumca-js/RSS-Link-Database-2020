His wife, Elsie, was 44, a much-loved nurse, mother to their children, Anna, 16, and Andrew, 22; she was his soulmate and best friend, a “genuine person,” he says. Elsie died on 8 April, on a ventilator, in Birmingham’s Good Hope hospital.</p><p>Ken believes she became infected sometime in that eerie, frightening week after Monday 16 March, when Boris Johnson’s government reconsidered its previous light-touch approach, which had envisaged 60% of the population – 40 million people – would become infected, and while many would die, the majority would recover and attain “herd immunity”. That week, although more physical distancing had been advised by Johnson, normal life mostly continued until the compulsory lockdown; pubs, restaurants and gyms stayed open, as did schools, until Friday 20 March. Sazuze, who served 10 years in the British army before studying to be a nurse himself, says he “never liked that herd immunity idea”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p> It would require a heart of stone not to be moved by such a story of illness and new life. But this is no apolitical birth</p><p>Less than a month ago, Boris Johnson was close to becoming the first prime minister to die in office since the Victorian era. Today he is the third prime minister of the 21st century to be celebrating the birth of a new baby in No 10. It would require a heart of stone – and doubtless there are some of those where Johnson is concerned – not to be moved by this vertiginous private ascent from darkness into light. As a metaphor for the optimistic way the prime minister would like a troubled country to see the coronavirus crisis, it is beyond audacious. You could not make it up.</p><p>Let’s acknowledge, if nothing else, that today’s announcement was a brilliantly executed piece of political tradecraft. The operation in Downing Street is still a lot smarter than many would like to think when they see it preside over those wooden and evasive daily briefings. That’s because, over the 24 hours preceding the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-and-carrie-symonds-announce-birth-of-baby-boy">announcement</a> that Carrie Symonds and Johnson had had a baby son, No 10 played the media brilliantly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/boris-johnson-baby-personality-politics">Continue reading...</a>

Probably emerging in the spring of 1918 in the American midwest, this new virus moved through the US largely unnoticed by a nation at war. Soon, though, it travelled to Europe through American troops, infecting first combatants, then the entire continent and beyond. But this pandemic was only getting started. In late August a second, more deadly wave crashed on to the shores of the US, France and Sierra Leone almost simultaneously and rushed from there to sicken the entire world. This was, in many communities, soon followed by a third wave. When the virus finally slowed in 1920, an estimated 500 million people had been stricken worldwide, and 50 million to 100 million people had perished. Of those, 675,000 deaths were in the US.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/us-responses-1918-flu-pandemic-offer-stark-lessons-coronavirus-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From baobabs to London planes, the unique characteristics of the Earth’s trees and their role in human lives</p><p>There’s a whole world in every tree, says Jonathan Drori. Travelling eastwards from his London home, he chooses 80 trees from the 60,000 or so species on the planet. He starts with the London Plane, “a tree of pomp and circumstance”, first planted in Berkeley Square, Mayfair, in 1789. A hybrid of the American sycamore and the Oriental plane, they have set an example to urban planners around the world.</p><p>The smooth bark of the beech has long been associated with writing: beech boards once enclosed vellum books and in many languages the words for this tree and for the written word are similar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/29/around-the-world-in-80-trees-by-jonathan-drori-review-a-wonderful-tour">Continue reading...</a>

## Lockdown is distorting our memories – but there are ways to regain control | Julia Shaw

<p>In the absence of life’s daily landmarks, we can stop our brains creating false memories by staging memorable events at home<br /></p><p>Since the lockdown began, time and memory seem to have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/lockdown-time-coronavirus-prisoners">lost all meaning</a>. In March, the days seemed incredibly long, interspersed by daily news that had radical effects on our lives. I found myself saying things like, “can you believe it’s only been three days since we went into lockdown”? Now, in April, the converse is true. I often find myself trying to remember whether it has been two, three or five weeks since this first started.</p><p>During lockdown, the passing of time has come to resemble a Salvador Dalí dreamscape. The surrealist artist’s famous painting of melting clocks includes a silver pocketwatch draped like a shirt hung up to dry over a dead tree branch. Like overripe cheese, his clocks are soft and malleable, and represent what Dalí referred to as “the camembert of time”. In an attempt to challenge our sense of reality, he titled this piece <a href="https://uk.phaidon.com/agenda/art/articles/2016/may/10/salvador-dalis-the-persistence-of-memory-explained/">The Persistence of Memory</a>. It reminds us that time and memory are inherently linked, and neither are as rigid as we seem to think.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/29/lockdown-distorting-memories-daily-landmarks-brains-false-memories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The German Society for Nature Photography (GDT) has selected its Nature Photographer of the Year 2020.</p><p>The winning image is part of a series of photographs taken in Dortmund’s north by Peter Lindel. Compared with many international nature photography hot spots, this region has little to offer. Lindel spent a lot of time and blood, sweat and tears working on this project on his doorstep. It is a beautiful statement about the long-term exploration of a single species and region.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/apr/29/2020-gdt-nature-photographer-of-the-year">Continue reading...</a>

## Survey of London: Oxford Street review – a bravura history, but also an obituary?

<p>From public hangings to Primark … a lively account of the capital’s famous shopping street, edited by Andrew Saint </p><p>In all its years, the Survey of London has never before accorded an entire volume to a single road. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/05/top-pf-the-shops-oxford-street-survived-death-high-street">Oxford Street stretches for more than a mile</a> and exhibits, as editor Andrew Saint writes in his lively and erudite introduction, nothing so much as “persistent incoherence”. London’s most famous street, if not the most elegant, has been indulging shopping preferences and fashion fads for more than two centuries. Vogue<em> </em>magazine’s fictional Mrs Exeter might, in the 1950s, have favoured Bond Street, where she window shopped and dreamed expensively, but Oxford Street was already well established as the province of “that increasingly exuberant pair, Mr and Mrs Everyman”. The street and its environs, under the intense scrutiny of Saint and his colleagues, reveals itself as a kind of diorama, demonstrably thriving one moment, jaded and playing catch-up the next.</p><p>Initially, the western end,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/jan/09/what-to-see-near-marble-arch-tube"> Tyburn, </a>was unconducive to anyone except ghoulish types eager to witness public executions. By the close of that business in the 1780s, Tyburn Road had already become Oxford Street – its continuation, the Edgware Road, turns north there – while the gruesome site was marked by an insignificant tollhouse and, later, by Marble Arch. Further east, the first shops were in front rooms, unshowy and homely, tending to a specialism. In the late 18th century, a third of the 92 businesses were connected to the garment trade. By the 1820s, a flurry of covered bazaars on the Parisian model had sprung up; architect Owen Jones, bathed in the reflected glory of his role at the 1851 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/aug/28/how-the-great-exhibition-of-1851-still-influences-science-today">Great Exhibition,</a> soon upped the game with the Crystal Palace Bazaar of 1858 and Osler’s Glass Shop, the “most scintillating” of Victorian shop interiors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/29/survey-of-london-oxford-street-review-a-bravura-history-but-also-an-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the world wonders about the health of North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un, his sister’s new prominence is nothing to welcome<strong><br /></strong></p><p>Rumours of Kim Jong-un’s death have been greatly exaggerated: according to South Korea’s national security adviser, the North Korean leader is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/kim-jong-un-is-alive-and-well-says-south-koreas-security-adviser">“alive and well”</a>. In a CNN interview on Sunday, Moon Chung-in refuted the conjecture that Kim is seriously ill or dead, saying he seemed to be holed up in the North Korean resort town of Wonsan.

<p>Illustrator Jonathan Edwards on how his travel sketchbooks are bringing back memories of places and experiences </p><p><strong>On family holidays, my parents would give me a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>book of A4 </strong><strong>paper to keep me quiet</strong>. I’m drawing in every holiday photo! Actually, I’ve drawn every day for as long as I can remember. <br /><br /><strong>I’ve always taken a sketchbook on my travels … and a </strong><strong>major part of my work as an illustrator is based on travel drawings</strong>. I see what catches my eye, then sit on a bench or at a cafe window and stay for about an hour. I take two sketchbooks: an A6 one that fits in my pocket and an A4 watercolour sketchbook that I use if I have more time. In Britain, no one pays me any notice. In, say, Japan, people are more likely to come and talk or to stand at a respectful distance and watch.<br /><br /><strong>My tools are usually just a grey brush pen and a black brush pen</strong>. With pencil, you know you can rub it out if it goes wrong and in a similar way, grey ink seems to fool the mind into thinking it’s not permanent. I go over the sketch in black ink later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/29/my-travel-sketches-jonathan-edwards-some-drawings-remind-me-how-the-sun-felt-on-my-skin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Hollywood star and bestselling author is becoming a podcaster. He discusses his fight against circumcision, his fear of Harvey Weinstein – and why he is an optimist to the core</p><p>‘I’m loving the idea of being here for a sustained period of time,” says Alan Cumming, speaking over Zoom from his “country pile” buried deep in New York’s Catskill mountains. It is purpose-built for isolation. “I realised I’ve been craving it; it’s a shame it took a global pandemic to make it happen.”</p><p>The 55-year-old actor has been rigorous about lockdown. He is asthmatic, so he has been out past his gate only once in five weeks. Cumming spends his days with his husband, the artist Grant Shaffer, and their dogs Lala and Jerry, mostly writing. In the evenings, he has Zoom cocktails – last night it was with his old Good Wife co-star <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/julianna-margulies-the-good-wife-hot-zone-ebola-interview">Julianna Margulies</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/29/alan-cumming-i-never-thought-about-my-foreskin-until-i-came-to-america">Continue reading...</a>

## A €22m chair? Eileen Gray, the design genius who scared the pants off Corbusier

<p>Her ravishing interiors shocked Paris, thrilled the avant-garde and gave the world its most expensive chair. But the fast-living aristocrat wasn’t just overlooked – Le Corbusier actually vandalised her work naked</p><p>‘A room fit only for nightmares and insomnia.” This was the response of one critic to Eileen Gray’s radical scheme for a bedroom in 1923, installed at the 14th Salon de la Société des Artistes Décorateurs in Paris. The Irish designer’s daring <a href="https://www.architecture.com/image-library/RIBApix/image-information/poster/monte-carlo-bedroomboudoir-xiv-salon-des-artistes-decorateurs-paris-1923/posterid/RIBA69850.html">Boudoir for Monte Carlo</a> was a shock to French tastes. Her zebra-wood divan stood before wall panels lacquered with abstract red and white shapes. It was flanked by two screens made of glossy white bricks, while a blue lantern dangled above a carpet swirling with further abstract squiggles. “A chamber for the daughter of Dr Caligari in all its horrors,” concluded another reviewer.<br /><br />Despite all the abuse, Gray received an admiring postcard from JJP Oud, the leading architect of the Dutch <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stijl">De Stijl movement</a>, who saw her installation pictured in a journal. “I am highly interested and should like to see any more of your works,” he wrote. “I saw until now very few good modern interiors.” In a PS, he added: “Do you have any modern ‘movement’ in your country?”</p><p>You might think of 1920s Paris as being at the cutting edge of modern style, but it took the bedroom fantasy of an Irishwoman from County Wexford to catch the eye of the European avant garde. Her curious design is reproduced in a substantial new book from <a href="https://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?k=9780300251067">Yale University Press</a>, published this month to accompany <a href="https://www.bgc.bard.edu/gallery/exhibitions/99/eileen-gray">an exhibition </a>on Gray at the Bard Graduate Center Gallery in New York – which has now, like every other venue, been forced to close its doors. When it reopens, visitors will be treated to a collection of 200 objects, including never-before-exhibited furniture, lacquer works, architectural drawings and ephemera. Like the book, these paint a complex picture of Gray as a multifaceted creator.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/29/most-expensive-22m-chair-eileen-gray-design-genius-scared-corbusier-naked">Continue reading...</a>

## Ten reasons why a 'Greater Depression' for the 2020s is inevitable

<p>Ominous and risky trends were around long before Covid-19, making an L-shaped depression very likely</p><p>After the 2007-09 financial crisis, the imbalances and risks pervading the global economy were exacerbated by policy mistakes. So, rather than address the structural problems that the financial collapse and ensuing recession revealed, governments mostly kicked the can down the road, creating major <a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/white-swan-risks-2020-by-nouriel-roubini-2020-02">downside risks</a> that made another crisis inevitable. And now that it has arrived, the risks are growing even more acute. Unfortunately, even if the Greater Recession leads to a lacklustre U-shaped recovery this year, an L-shaped “<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/coronavirus-greater-great-depression-by-nouriel-roubini-2020-03">Greater Depression</a>” will follow later in this decade, owing to 10 ominous and risky trends.</p><p>The first trend concerns deficits and their corollary risks: debts and defaults. The policy response to the Covid-19 crisis entails a massive increase in fiscal deficits – on the order of 10% of GDP or more – at a time when public debt levels in many countries were already high, if not unsustainable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/29/ten-reasons-why-greater-depression-for-the-2020s-is-inevitable-covid">Continue reading...</a>
