The next Assassin's Creed, titled Valhalla, has officially been announced and it has, you guessed it, vikings. Cliff Blezinski, of Gears of Wars, LawBreakers, and Radical Heights fame, is making the most of his quarantine time and is working on a new project, but it may not be a game.

Techland is bringing Hellraid back from the dead and the project is getting a second lease on life as paid DLC for Dying Light. Also, the Epic Games Store is taking some extra precautions for its free games.

## Assassin's Creed Valhalla Story Details & Characters: What We Know So Far

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is set at the height of the Viking Age, and we spoke to game's narrative director about crafting its unique story. 

Valhalla focuses on the Viking clans as they are driven out of Norway s. You play as clan leader Eivor, who can be either a man or woman, much like Assassin's Creed Odyssey's dual protagonists Alexios and Kassandra. We explore this, and more information about the game, in the video above.

Valhalla releases on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via the Epic Games Store this holiday. There are multiple special editions in the works, so check GameSpot's pre-order guide for pricing information.

Over the course of an eight-hour livestream, Ubisoft slowly revealed that the rumors were true: the next Assassin's Creed game will take place during The Viking Age. Called Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the game is scheduled to get a brand-new trailer very soon.

If you missed out on the livestream or couldn't watch the whole thing (because, again, it was eight hours long), we have you covered. The video above is a sped-up timelapse of the complete stream, condensing the entire experience into five minutes. That's a little bit more manageable in our opinion.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is scheduled to release this year, though an exact launch date hasn't been announced yet--Ubisoft hasn't revealed which systems the game is coming out for either, though it's a good bet we'll see the game on Xbox One, PS4, PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5.

Given the time period--The Viking Age started in the ninth century and continued through to the eleventh--it's likely Valhalla will continue the origin story of the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order, which began in Assassin's Creed Origins and continued in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. The Viking Age actually ends just before the events of the original 2007 Assassin's Creed.

## Evolution of Assassin’s Creed Gameplay - From The Holy Land To Valhalla

With the announcement that Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is taking us to the Viking Age, let’s take a look back at how the gameplay of Ubisoft’s flagship franchise has evolved over time. From early days of Altair's social stealth, to Ezio's city renovations, Edward's naval combat, Bayek's Eagle Vision, and beyond. Let’s delve into the Animus and explore the series major gameplay evolutions.

With the announcement of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Ubisoft's popular history-based franchise dives into The Viking Age, which occurred between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Funnily enough, that's right before the events of 2007's Assassin's Creed, the game that started this massive franchise in the first place--meaning Ubisoft has almost gone full circle.

Or at least it has in terms of its story. When it comes to gameplay, the franchise as a whole has been a steady evolution. What started as a stealth-driven action game has now become a franchise defined by its massive open worlds and action-focused combat. In the video above, Lucy James details this full transformation, describing how the mechanics and features of Assassin's Creed have changed since 2007.

Full disclosure: the video only covers the mainline entries of Assassin's Creed. That means we skip over handheld titles (like Assassin's Creed Pirates and Assassin's Creed Rebellion) and spin-offs (such as Assassin's Creed III: Liberation and Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China). It's not that those games haven't contributed long-term gameplay traditions or storybeats too, but this video is already over 10 minutes long--it would be a monstrous task to cover all 22 Assassin's Creed games.

Side note: Can you believe that there have been 22 (soon to be 23) Assassin's Creed games in 13 years? Which one was your favorite? Let us know in the comments section below.

## Gears Tactics - 7 Crucial Tips To Keep Your Units Alive

Gears Tactics can be tough, especially if you've never played a tactical turn-based game before. Luckily, Jake has 7 tips and strategies to help you tear through the Locust horde.

Gears Tactics is now out, providing a very different gameplay experience for a Gears of War game--even more so than the open-world nature of Gears 5. Whether Gears Tactics is your first tactics game or you're a longtime fan of the genre, there are a few key details to know before going in.

In the video above, Jake Dekker goes over seven tips and tricks for Gears Tactics. Follow his advice and you'll have a much better chance at overcoming its tough, tactics-based combat. Tactics game veterans may recognize a few pieces of advice--like making sure to know the differences between and then utilizing low and high cover--though Gears Tactics does have a few mechanics and features all its own that you'll have to take into account. 

For example, using executions nabs you extra action points, allowing you to increase the duration of your turn and end a conflict more quickly. Additionally, since Gears Tactics is a Gears of War game, the enemies you encounter behave like they do in the rest of the franchise--encouraging you to go up against them with similar strategies.

In GameSpot's Gears Tactics review, Mike Epstein wrote, "Though Gears Tactics wears itself a little thin by the end of its protracted campaign, the rush of pulling together a victory from the jaws of defeat carries an exciting, chaotic energy. Unlike most strategy games, playing well doesn't necessarily make you feel like a mastermind, so much as though you've cheated death. Every successful plan, even a last-ditch effort, feels like a small stroke of genius. That's no small feat."

## How Games Get Grenades Wrong - Loadout

Most games and movies get grenades wrong. Whether it’s tactically cooking a frag in Call of Duty, throwing grenades back in Battlefield, or the huge fireballs we see in blockbusters like Commando, games and movies have totally exaggerated the humble hand grenade.

While there is a grain of truth in how games and movies depict the handheld explosive, the vast majority of depictions blow its impact out of proportion, so where does the truth end and the action movie trope begin?
