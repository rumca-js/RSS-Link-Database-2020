Here's a live looping jam of Gorlami with Brad Pitt as Aldo Raine from Inglourious Basterds

Equipment used:
- Elektron Octatrack MkII
- Novation Circuit
- Korg Microkorg XL+
- iConnectAudio4+
- Fender Stratocaster w Vintage Noiseless pickups
- Fender Precision Bass
- myVolts mickXer

Music-nerd stuff:
This jam is DAWless. All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.
The Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+ (ica4+), which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit, Microkorg. MIDI start/play message goes to the Circuit only, and starts the drum kit, but since it's tied to a Thru machine Track 1 on the Octatrack that only trigs at a later section, you hear it come in later.
This jam uses the Arranger with one-shot record trigs, depending on the pattern, recording different tracks. The final guitar improv was a manual trigger of the recording (I turned on Record Quick Mode). I'd much rather use a pedal, but I'm short one MIDI cable to connect my Logidy UMI3 to it. Perhaps the next one.
