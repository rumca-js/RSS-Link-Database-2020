Believe you\u2019re not an accident. Believe you were made to last forever. Believe God has chosen you to have a relationship with Jesus, who died on the cross for you. Believe that no matter what you\u2019ve done, God wants to forgive you. Second, receive. Receive his forgiveness for your sins. Receive his Spirit, who will give you the power to fulfill your life purpose. ... Wherever you are reading this, I invite you to bow your head and quietly whisper the prayer that will change your eternity. \u2018Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you.\u2019 Go ahead. If you sincerely meant that prayer, congratulations! Welcome to the family of God!\u201d\u201d \r\n\r\n     Lord I Lift Your Name on High\r\n\r\n   Bible\u2019s emphasis on resurrection --\r\n\r\n ...If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. \r\n\r\n \u201cBy vindicating Christ in His resurrection, the Father declared His acceptance of Jesus\u2019 work on our behalf... Had Christ not been raised, we would have a mediator whose redeeming work in our behalf was not acceptable to God.\u201d -- RC Sproul\r\n\r\n \u201cThe cross and the empty tomb stand at the center of the Christian faith. Without these, there is no good news \u2014 no salvation.\u201d -- Albert Mohler\r\n\r\n Emptiness of \u201creligion\u201d and the alternatives\r\n\r\n A.) Pop culture -- \u201che\u2019s in a better place\u201d\r\n\r\n B.) Atheist eulogy: And the physicist will remind the congregation of how much of all our energy is given off as heat. There may be a few fanning themselves with their programs as he says it. And he will tell them that the warmth that flowed through you in life is still here, still part of all that we are, even as we who mourn continue the heat of our own lives.\r\n\r\n And you'll want the physicist to explain to those who loved you that they need not have faith; indeed, they should not have faith. Let them know that they can measure, that scientists have measured precisely the conservation of energy and found it accurate, verifiable and consistent across space and time. You can hope your family will examine the evidence and satisfy themselves that the science is sound and that they'll be comforted to know your energy's still around. According to the law of the conservation of energy, not a bit of you is gone; you're just less orderly. Amen. \r\n\r\n Proofs of the Resurrection\r\n\r\n   Empty tomb -- why didn\u2019t his enemies just produce his body?\r\n\r\n   Eyewitnesses -- Christianity began spreading rapidly as the eyewitness accounts began to spread.\r\n\r\n   Disciples\u2019 boldness -- Seeing a resurrected Christ turned Peter from being afraid of a little girl to proclaiming Christ...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHC9A12M0EQ", "date_published": "2020-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
