All the recording, playback and sequencing was done within the Octatrack.\nThe Octatrack is the master clock, which is sent via MIDI DIN to the iConnectAudio4+ (ica4+), which sends midi out via usb to the Circuit, Microkorg. MIDI start/play message goes to the Circuit only, and starts the drum kit, but since it's tied to a Thru machine Track 1 on the Octatrack that only trigs at a later section, you hear it come in later.\nThis jam uses the Arranger with one-shot record trigs, depending on the pattern, recording different tracks. The final guitar improv was a manual trigger of the recording (I turned on Record Quick Mode). I'd much rather use a pedal, but I'm short one MIDI cable to connect my Logidy UMI3 to it. Perhaps the next one.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=df3465-QUW8", "date_published": "2020-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
