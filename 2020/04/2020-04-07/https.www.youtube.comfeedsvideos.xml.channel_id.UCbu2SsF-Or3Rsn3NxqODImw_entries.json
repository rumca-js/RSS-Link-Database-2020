This franchise is a seemingly never-ending discovery of new characters, features, and money-making schemes. We have only scratched the surface.\n\nWhich is our way of saying that we have even more tips we wish we had known before starting our island adventure in New Horizons. In the video above, Kallie Plagge details six more strategies for getting the most out of Nintendo's latest Animal Crossing game. For example, did you know that you can actually shorten the time it takes to craft an item by spamming the \"A\" button?\n\nThough we've discovered even more secrets since our last video, that doesn't mean we've found them all. If you notice that we haven't gone over your favorite way of earning Bells or you know of a faster means of unlocking certain buildings that we haven't talked about--please tell us! Let us know what we've missed in the comments below.\n\nIn GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review, Kallie Plagge writes, \"New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n#AnimalCrossing #NewHorizons #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MFOD_PWq3g", "date_published": "2020-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call Of Duty Modern Warfare Season 3: Everything You Need To Know In Under 3 Minutes", "description": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Season 3 launches on April 8 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and it's bringing a bunch of new content to both Modern Warfare itself and the free-to-play, standalone Warzone.

He arrives alongside three new multiplayer maps: Talsik Backlot, Hovec Sawmill, and Aniyah Incursion.

But until recently, we've had questions about how the game's single-play campaign would function.\n\nPhil and Tony discuss this in the video above, touching on Disintegration's apocalyptic setting, where fully integrated robots are at war with those who wish to retain their humanity. Each mission has you fighting against the Reyon forces, led by the indomitable Black Shuck. \n\nDisintegration is still slated for a 2020 release. It's coming to PS4, Xbox One, and PC.\n\nNote: Each multiplayer crew in Disintegration has their own specific loadout, a Gravcycle with unique weapons, and various ground units with a variety of special abilities. These crew loadouts cannot be customized; however there will be a variety of options to change the appearance of each crew with a host of cosmetic unlocks.\n\n#Disintegration #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzvMrt6w2SI", "date_published": "2020-04-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Let's Play Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare Season 3", "description": "Call Of Duty Season 3 has begun!

Running from April 7-21, the update is bringing a map change and a batch of new cosmetics.\n\nThat map change is a town takeover, adding a prowler enclosure to World's Edge where you'll find both antagonistic animals and high-tier loot. The Old Ways also offers a series of challenges you can complete to unlock new cosmetics, two of which are recolored versions of skins that were previously available during Season 1's Legendary Hunt. In fact, all the cosmetics from that event can be obtained during The Old Was if you missed them the first time around.\n\nThe game overall will see some changes outside of the event. Apex Legends is permanently adding duos as a game option, and you'll also be able to choose to drop on either World's Edge or King's Canyon.

He also analyzes the Basement Theme itself, speaking to guests (Jules Conroy and Adam Neely) with a better understanding of musical theory and composition to find out whether there was intent behind the madness of its execution.\n\nCheck out FamilyJules here: https://www.youtube.com/user/FamilyJules7X/about\n(Including his full cover of Mansion Basement: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIhZBiLtl1Y)\n\nAdam Neely:  https://www.youtube.com/user/havic5\n\nSubscribe to our channel here: https://www.youtube.com/user/gamespot\nThe previous episode of Remember When: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIMxAnBW7dA\n\nFollow us!\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/GameSpot\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/gamespot/?hl=en \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/GameSpot/\n\n#RememberWhen #ResidentEvil #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-En6wZOsm4k", "date_published": "2020-04-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
