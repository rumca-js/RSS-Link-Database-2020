In the days of three channels and no streaming, Texas-set soap opera Dallas regularly attracted more than 20 million viewers to the BBC. In 1980, its \u201cWho shot JR?\u201d cliffhanger kept an entire nation in suspense for the eight months between the oil baron\u2019s attempted murder and the big reveal of the culprit. By that point, evidently, UK audiences could wait no longer and the BBC decided to compress the usual two-week delay between US and UK broadcast to just 18 hours.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/28/once-upon-a-time-from-america-how-us-television-took-over-our-screens\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/28/once-upon-a-time-from-america-how-us-television-took-over-our-screens", "date_published": "2020-04-28 08:00:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The war on coronavirus should be led by councils.

He lives in Hong Kong, where he runs a payment technology firm. His staff isn\u2019t large \u2013 just 20 employees \u2013 but finding even a few hundred masks proved hard. Part of the problem was that last year, after protesters in Hong Kong used masks to hide their identity, the Chinese government restricted supplies from the mainland. Before the pandemic, half the world\u2019s masks were manufactured in China; now, with production there shifting into overdrive, that figure may be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-richest-country-on-earth-cant-get-you-a-face-mask-11585741254\" title=\"\">as high as 85%</a>. If China isn\u2019t sending you masks, you likely aren\u2019t getting any at all. We have no masks, local pharmacies told Olea, but if you find some, we\u2019ll buy them from you.</p><p>Olea got to work. In a journal article, he read that epidemiologists spoke highly of N95 respirators, masks that filter out 95% of small particulate matter. Stealing time out of his day job, Olea began phoning N95 suppliers in Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Ireland. Each one turned him down. \u201cThe answers ranged from \u2018No\u2019 to \u2018We only sell to accredited buyers\u2019 to \u2018Come back next year,\u2019\u201d Olea told me. After three days, Olea found a South African firm named North Safety Products, which had 500,000 masks in stock. Olea bought them all, at less than a pound per mask, certain that he would be able to sell the surplus.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/face-masks-coveted-commodity-coronavirus-pandemic\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/face-masks-coveted-commodity-coronavirus-pandemic", "date_published": "2020-04-28 05:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Nightlife in quarantine: what club kids are wearing in lockdown", "description": "<p>With club spaces closed worldwide, DJs, performers and other disco dwellers are faced with a new challenge \u2013 how do you keep the party going? <br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2020/apr/28/nightlife-in-quarantine-what-club-kids-are-wearing-in-lockdown\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2020/apr/28/nightlife-in-quarantine-what-club-kids-are-wearing-in-lockdown", "date_published": "2020-04-28 05:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The extreme loneliness of lockdown: 'Even though my partner is here, I\u2019m struggling to cope'", "description": "<p>After weeks of isolation, many people are falling prey to loneliness.
