Another is Made in China 2025\nYour energy demands for electricity, oil, etc, are higher than ever and it\u2019s gonna keep growing \nThe original Silk Road that connected China to the rest of the world runs through an area of China called Xinjiang.\nXinjiang is also home to a ton of natural resources.\nIt has 40% of your coal reserves, 25% of your gas reserves, so Xinjiang is your most important piece of land\nXinjiang is home to the Uighurs\nIf Uighurs don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re a part of the Chinese culture, they could want to form their own independent nation\nIf you don\u2019t do something about this issue, everything falls apart\n\nYou need to flood the city with police and 24 hour surveillance to keep the peace. So you turn Xinjiang into a high tech police state to categorize people as safe, regular, or unsafe\n\nSo you build re-education camps\nThis is gonna cost a lot of money to build and maintain but the ROI of tightening our grip on this region will be make us a lot more money \nWhile you have all these people captured, you might as well use them as cheap labor\nWe can\u2019t afford to lose any business so once word does get out, you gotta suck up your pride and control the narrative\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
