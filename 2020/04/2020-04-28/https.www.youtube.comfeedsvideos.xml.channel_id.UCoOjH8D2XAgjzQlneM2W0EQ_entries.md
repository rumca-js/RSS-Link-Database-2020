-----------------------
So you’re China
You have the ambitions to take over the world and your economy is growing fast
One way you’re funding your goal is with your Belt and Road Initiative, or one belt one road, a plan to make it easier for anyone to trade with China. Another is Made in China 2025
Your energy demands for electricity, oil, etc, are higher than ever and it’s gonna keep growing 
The original Silk Road that connected China to the rest of the world runs through an area of China called Xinjiang.
Xinjiang is also home to a ton of natural resources.
It has 40% of your coal reserves, 25% of your gas reserves, so Xinjiang is your most important piece of land
Xinjiang is home to the Uighurs
If Uighurs don’t feel like they’re a part of the Chinese culture, they could want to form their own independent nation
If you don’t do something about this issue, everything falls apart

You need to flood the city with police and 24 hour surveillance to keep the peace. So you turn Xinjiang into a high tech police state to categorize people as safe, regular, or unsafe

So you build re-education camps
This is gonna cost a lot of money to build and maintain but the ROI of tightening our grip on this region will be make us a lot more money 
While you have all these people captured, you might as well use them as cheap labor
We can’t afford to lose any business so once word does get out, you gotta suck up your pride and control the narrative
