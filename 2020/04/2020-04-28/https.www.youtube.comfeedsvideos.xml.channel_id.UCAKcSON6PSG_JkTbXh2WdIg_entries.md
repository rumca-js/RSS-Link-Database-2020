Norwegian singer-songwriter Aurora Aksnes — known professionally as Aurora — had first imagined the songs she was working on would comprise three albums, then one, before she firmly decided on two. "I realized that with time, with a lot of thinking, I did realize that I have been writing about two very different parts, but of the same process I would say," she says. "So it makes very much sense spiritually and musically to split it into two parts, so it makes sense now."

That first part, Infections of a Different Kind - step 1, was released in September, 2018. The second part, A Different Kind of Human (Step 2) was released in June, 2019. While in town for a show in the First Avenue Mainroom in 2019, Aurora — along with bandmates Silja Sol, Fredrik Vogsborg and Magnus Skylstad — stopped at The Current for a session hosted by Mac Wilson.

Aurora is based in Bergen, a city on Norway's west coast that Aurora says is home to a thriving artistic community. "It is a very good place to become a musician or a producer or artist," she explains. "We're all very close; we all know each other and support each other. … There's a lot of indie music coming out from Bergen. It's a very good community; we're very lucky."

SONGS PERFORMED

"Animal"
"Churchyard"
"It Happened Quiet"

The second and third songs is from Aurora's 2018 album, Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1); the first song is from Aurora's next album A Different Kind of Human (Step 2), released in 2019. Both are released on Decca Records and distributed in the U.S. on Glassnote Records.
