<p>City known for its labyrinthine lanes draws up ‘confidence charter’ to reassure visitors</p><p>More than 8 million people visit York each year, packing cheek-by-jowl into its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snickelways_of_York">narrow snickelways</a> and labyrinthine lanes. Yet what was until recently a key attraction of the Viking city is now a physical distancing nightmare: how can you keep two metres away from everybody else when one of the top tourist attractions is a street called the Shambles that is scarcely wide enough to navigate on a go-kart?</p><p>One idea is the introduction of a one-way system for pedestrians, which would stop tourists rubbing up against each other in streets that in the 14th century allowed the Black Death to spread so rapidly that half the population was wiped out one summer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/28/one-way-shambles-how-york-is-trying-to-keep-its-narrow-streets-safe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prime minister’s steadfast approval ratings may be down to the large number of people coping with coronavirus – so far<br /></p><p>If asked a month ago how the nation would celebrate the easing of the lockdown, I would never have imagined it would be with a trip to the council tip.</p><p>Yet it’s a measure of how dramatically our horizons have shrunk that the heady prospect of dumping some rubbish, plus the chance of a socially distanced trip to the garden centre, can now be held out by ministers as a reward for six weeks of self-sacrifice. Nobody falls asleep at night dreaming of a chance to offload six weeks’ worth of grass clippings. Yet after a month or more inside, some of us have learned to take our thrills where we can: a cup of tea in the sunshine, a phone call, a friendly word with the neighbours when putting out the bins. The happiest people in lockdown are those most capable of finding solace in small things, and it’s this dramatic lowering of expectations under pressure that might help explain the baffling paradox in politics right now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/happiness-increasing-boris-johnson-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Although he graced European and FA Cup finals, the former striker, who has died at 61, truly shone as a broadcaster in Spain </p><p>Michael Robinson had a big heart and loved telling stories. He told stories on the telly, he told stories on the radio and he told stories every time you were with him. Warm, funny, human stories. Endlessly. He could talk and talk, though he listened too. You couldn’t meet him for lunch and get back before dinner. He loved football but above all he loved people, good people. The game, which he understood and communicated better than anyone – an explanation of on-field “reference points” lingers in the mind, a moment’s revelation – was the excuse for everything else, he said.</p><p>The problem with that is it suggested he wasn’t good at the game, which is what he tended to suggest too. Ian Rush was a genius who made him look good, he would say: all he had to do was nod the ball on, any old place, and it would magically become the perfect assist. As if that was easy. Not just anyone joins Liverpool, where he would play in goal in training – Cat, they called him – and stand outside the toilet reading the programme to Kenny Dalglish on match days. Where he managed to go to West Ham and score a hat-trick in the pouring rain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/michael-robinson-european-cup-winner-voice-spanish-tv-died-61">Continue reading...</a>

## Trump is unravelling – even his supporters can't ignore it now | Arwa Mahdawi

<p>The president is leaning heavily on sarcasm to excuse a range of blunders, but US conservatives are unimpressed<br /></p><p>I don’t know what kind of disinfectant Donald Trump has been injecting, but the man does not appear to be well. The president’s lethal medical musing has turned him into (even more of) a global laughing stock and the widespread ridicule has clearly bruised his fragile ego. While Trump has never been a paradigm of calmness or competence, he has become increasingly irate and erratic in recent days. Now even his diehard supporters seem to be cooling towards him. Is the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/19/a-very-stable-genius-review-donald-trump-leonnig-rucker-washington-post">very stable genius</a>” starting to unravel?</p><p>Let’s start with the president’s weekend tweetstorm, which, even by Trumpian standards, was spectacularly unhinged. On Sunday, Trump lashed out at what he called a “phony story” in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html">New York Times</a> that claimed he spends his days eating junk food and watching TV. “I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night &amp; read &amp; see [in the Times] that I am angrily eating a hamberger &amp; Diet Coke in my bedroom,” he tweeted. “People with me are always stunned.” He then deleted the tweet and <a href="https://twitter.com/gtconway3d/status/1254491971558748160?s=20">replaced it with one</a> in which hamburger was spelled correctly. (This was clearly a challenge for him: he has previously misspelled hamburgers “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/01/16/burger-king-hamberder-chain-trolls-president-trump-over-tweet/2590994002">hamberders</a>”.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/28/trump-is-unravelling-even-his-supporters-cant-ignore-it-now">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Dallas to Friends, US shows have dominated UK TV for decades – and the special relationship is still going strong</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/picture/2020/apr/28/modern-toss">Modern Toss on Friends</a></li></ul><p>“I’ll be there for you,” they told us, and they weren’t lying. This week marks 25 years since the US sitcom Friends first aired on UK television, although sometimes it seems as if no time has passed at all. Between 1995 and 2004, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/friends">Friends</a> was such a dominant presence on UK screens that it is difficult to remember what our nights in were like without the old gang. Even now, getting in some hang-time with Ross, Rachel, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Pheebs is as easy as firing up Netflix or switching to Channel 5.</p><p>US television has been waging a steady invasion campaign for decades, so while Friends was a turning point, it certainly wasn’t the first American TV show to find a major audience on British screens. In the days of three channels and no streaming, Texas-set soap opera Dallas regularly attracted more than 20 million viewers to the BBC. In 1980, its “Who shot JR?” cliffhanger kept an entire nation in suspense for the eight months between the oil baron’s attempted murder and the big reveal of the culprit. By that point, evidently, UK audiences could wait no longer and the BBC decided to compress the usual two-week delay between US and UK broadcast to just 18 hours.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/28/once-upon-a-time-from-america-how-us-television-took-over-our-screens">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We’re working from home, and I was hoping that would lead to more sex. But she seems uninterested</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong>My girlfriend and I have great sex. </strong><strong> From day one of our relationship she has embraced my desire for BDSM. She lets me tie her up</strong><strong> – to chairs, the bed</strong><strong>, the sofa. However, in recent months, I feel her desire has dwindled. I’m a very sexual person; I fantasise about her on a regular basis and want to try new things</strong><strong>. My worry is that she doesn’t feel as sexually driven as me. We’re </strong><strong>working from home due to coronavirus, and for me that’s great</strong><strong>; in my head, we have all the time in the world to have sex. But she seems </strong><strong>uninterested. We do still have sex every now and then, but I worry that we’re worlds apart when it comes to desire.</strong></p><p>Don’t judge your sex life according to how you are experiencing it during this difficult time. Many of the current realities are causing temporary sexual changes in people, such as lowered desire or even a total absence of it. The fear and the many losses everyone is dealing with – such as loss of freedom, loss of social life, loss of safety, loss of privacy, loss of jobs and even loss of loved ones – contribute to anxiety, depression and other psychological issues that in turn negatively affect your sexual response cycle. In addition, working at home has affected you and your girlfriend in different ways; while you see it as offering sexual opportunities, she sees it as an unwelcome distraction from completing her work. Don’t take it personally, and don’t catastrophise. Simply recognise that this is a time to listen more acutely to each other’s evolving needs, to be patient and understanding and work as partners to adapt to the new lifestyle. This may mean talking gently with her to establish a comfortable time for sex when she is not stressed by the challenge of working at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/28/i-see-lockdown-as-a-chance-for-more-bdsm-but-my-girlfriend-doesnt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ben Mercer’s thought-provoking new book offers an insight into the life of an itinerant rugby union player, a lifestyle likely to become a thing of the past</p><p>If the penny is not already dropping for the majority of English rugby’s professional rugby players it soon will. When the sport does finally resume there will be tighter budgets, fewer alternative boltholes for those out of contract and, in the worst-case scenario, a rise in insolvent clubs. Aside from a lucky few, rugby’s age of austerity is about to kick off in earnest.<br /><br />The repercussions are starting to lap at the feet of Premiership players during the current lockdown and things will become significantly worse should the next Premiership TV deal involve less money and the RFU’s central funding decrease. What will that mean for squad sizes, reserve teams and academies? And if that is not enough to make all involved feel queasy, where does that leave those already struggling to scrape a living at Championship clubs?<br /><br />There is already a broader trend emerging. Squeezed between the top-end players and the legions of young hopefuls on tiny wages are hundreds of middle-ranking pros, once the bedrock of every club. Suddenly, if it boils down to a choice between a Premiership club renewing the contract of a 29-year-old on, say, £120,000 or signing an academy graduate on £12,000, harsh economic truths are coming into play.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/feb/28/rugby-union-needs-to-wake-up-to-the-slow-strangling-of-the-grassroots-game">Rugby needs to wake up to the slow strangling of the grassroots game</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/28/rugbys-journeymen-were-reaching-the-end-of-the-road-before-this-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

There are currently no details of which books the partnership will tackle, though many of Pratchett’s books have been adapted before: Sky has dramatised Hogfather, The Colour of Magic and Going Postal; Soul Music and Wyrd Sisters have been turned into animations, and Good Omens, starring David Tennant as the demon Crowley and Michael Sheen as the angel Aziraphale, was recently aired on Amazon Prime and the BBC, to positive reviews.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/28/terry-pratchett-novels-faithful-tv-adaptation-discworld">Continue reading...</a>

We were also referencing the Swedish vampire film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/22/let-right-one-alfredson-horror">Let the Right One In</a>, which replaced the darkness of a gothic story with a white wasteland.

Rather than the mythical business of lightning and thunder, we show power generated through electricity as a fantastical thing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/28/the-national-theatre-frankenstein-designer-mark-tildesley-danny-boyle">Continue reading...</a>

He is right, even when it comes to his peer group – possibly the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/11/barcelona-coaching-champions-league">most successful coaching class in history</a> – but it is still an unusual reflection for a man who was La Liga’s top scorer and, as a player and manager, won the league in three countries. All the more so when it is a reflection prompted by the time he led Chile to the 2016 Copa América. Minutes after winning the final, Pizzi sat before the press – and started talking about failure.</p><p>He laughs now but there was a lesson there. “It’s true: when you take over a team, most of the objectives you set, you fail to meet,” he says. “And however much you try to console yourself with your style, methodology, some improvement, what you want is to win and when you don’t, which is most of the time, disappointment comes. You lose more than you win and your mind is occupied more with defeat than enjoying victory, which is gone very quickly.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/28/juan-antonio-pizzi-bobby-robson-barcelona-chile-guardiola-alexis-sanchez-manchester-united">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the backstreets of Paris in Perfume to sun-baked Provence in Jean de Florette, visit France through great fiction</p><p>• <strong>Share your favourite fiction set in France in the comments</strong></p><p>I’ve written about France for The Guardian for more than a decade and have been visiting for longer: since my days as a teenage au pair and later a language student. I love it mainly for its food and wine, but also for its combative attitude to politics, its love of good living, elegant cities and variety of land- and seascapes. We can still visit it through the pages of literature. So, here are my personal top 10 novels that give <em>une véritable saveur</em> of the country almost nine million British people visited last year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/28/10-best-novels-about-france-paris-provence">Continue reading...</a>

For Sepuya, this time is harder.</p><p>“It seems much worse, in some ways, than September 11,” he says. “I was living downtown, maybe a mile from it, watching the whole thing happen.

<p>The global scramble for this vital item has exposed the harsh realities of international politics and the limits of the free market. By Samanth Subramanian</p><p>If Ovidiu Olea is astonished by the fact that he’s gone from being a finance guy to a mask mogul in four months, he shows no sign of it. The transition started innocuously. Late in January, when the coronavirus spread beyond Wuhan, Olea decided he would buy masks for his staff. He lives in Hong Kong, where he runs a payment technology firm. His staff isn’t large – just 20 employees – but finding even a few hundred masks proved hard. Part of the problem was that last year, after protesters in Hong Kong used masks to hide their identity, the Chinese government restricted supplies from the mainland. Before the pandemic, half the world’s masks were manufactured in China; now, with production there shifting into overdrive, that figure may be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-richest-country-on-earth-cant-get-you-a-face-mask-11585741254" title="">as high as 85%</a>. If China isn’t sending you masks, you likely aren’t getting any at all. We have no masks, local pharmacies told Olea, but if you find some, we’ll buy them from you.</p><p>Olea got to work. In a journal article, he read that epidemiologists spoke highly of N95 respirators, masks that filter out 95% of small particulate matter. Stealing time out of his day job, Olea began phoning N95 suppliers in Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Ireland. Each one turned him down. “The answers ranged from ‘No’ to ‘We only sell to accredited buyers’ to ‘Come back next year,’” Olea told me. After three days, Olea found a South African firm named North Safety Products, which had 500,000 masks in stock. Olea bought them all, at less than a pound per mask, certain that he would be able to sell the surplus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/face-masks-coveted-commodity-coronavirus-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>
