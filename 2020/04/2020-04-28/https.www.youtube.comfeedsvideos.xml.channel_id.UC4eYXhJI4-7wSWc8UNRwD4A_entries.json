Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nApril 28, 2020 | Felix Contreras -- This unprecedented period of worldwide lockdown has halted public musical performances. But it has also inspired intimate performances by musicians directly from the places where they create their music.\n\nThe Mexican duo known as Rodrigo y Gabriela travel the globe playing to crowds who are captivated by their almost telepathic acoustic guitar interplay. But they make their home in Mexico in a sunny Pacific beach town called Zihuatanejo (remember The Shawshank Redemption?). For this performance we get a peek at their home studio, where they surround themselves with guitars and dress down in sneakers and casual clothes. They run through tunes from throughout their recorded history, including a song they played at the Tiny Desk back in 2009. Rodrigo y Gabriela's picking and strumming feel more relaxed than usual but maintains their intense focus.\n\nSET LIST\n\nTamacun\nDiablo Rojo\nHanuman\nMettavolution", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMpGjox3TBs", "date_published": "2020-04-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
