Editor-in-chief Kyle Mann and creative director Ethan Nicolle talk to Dr. Jeff Myers, President of Summit Ministries, and author of the new book  Unquestioned Answers. They discuss cheesy church sign and bumper sticker theology, canned Christian clichés, easy answers, and the need to think deeply about the reasons for why we believe what we believe. Kyle and Ethan own Jeff with the ironclad "rabbit poop" proof for atheism and talk about the need for a more thoughtful faith.
