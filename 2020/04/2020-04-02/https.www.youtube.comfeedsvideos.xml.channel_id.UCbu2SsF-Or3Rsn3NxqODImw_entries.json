He also discusses the fairy tale influences behind her Persona, Cendrillon.\n\nIt doesn't feel like four years have passed since Persona 5 was originally released in 2016. Atlus' PlayStation 4-exclusive RPG developed a fervent fanbase and, thanks to their efforts, the title has remained an ever-present part of gaming culture. Persona 5 is a game that, in more than a few ways, was built to linger in the mind and stay in conversations. It's themes and subject matter are complex and its characters are nuanced. Everything from their visual design, to their personalities and their place within the story resonated with people on a meaningful level.\n\nIt can't be easy, then, to go back and introduce something new. Changing something that such a huge number of people have fallen deeply in love with is a daunting challenge, but to have that change be a brand new character placed at the center of the story is a potentially overwhelming one. But that's exactly what Atlus has done for Persona 5 Royal, and the task of designing the new character fell upon Shigenori Soejima. \n\nSoejima has defined the Persona series as we know it and, many of gaming's most recognizable characters are from his mind. In this episode of Audio Logs, Soejima shows us exactly how he approaches creating a new character. More specifically, how he created Kasumi, the newest member of the Phantom Thieves, who makes her debut in Persona 5 Royal.\n\nFrom the inspirations for her profile, to the fairy tale aesthetic of her Persona, Cendrillon, Soejima breaks it all down. The legendary designer puts a great deal of thought into even the smallest details and to be given insight into the thinking behind them is a rare treat, check it out above. \n\nYou can check out more episodes of Audio Logs on YouTube, where you'll find the entirety of Season 1 of the show, as well as numerous episodes from Season 2. We've got episodes for Death Stranding, Control, Gears 5, Cuphead, and more--they're all well worth watching.\n\n#Persona5Royal #AudioLogs  #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mb8EMQi1jpI", "date_published": "2020-04-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Resident Evil 3 - Official Launch Trailer", "description": "Reach for the S.T.A.R.S.\nResident Evil 3 is out now on PS4, XB1, and PC, with Resident Evil Resistance included!

A hulking, menacing beast, Nemesis is a more intelligent bad guy who hunts down Jill and torments her basically everywhere she goes. He can use weapons, too, which makes him an even deadlier combatant. \n\nBe sure to watch the full video to see some of the scariest Nemesis encounters in the Resident Evil 3 Remake. One thing to note is that this video includes a look at the final boss, so if you don't want to see that, pause or stop before the end. \n\nResident Evil 3 Remake launches on April 3 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC.

Well you came to the right place--in the video above, Jake Dekker walks through three sure-fire methods for quickly earning large amounts of Bells. \n\nYou'll have to get creative when it comes to making money in New Horizons. There are plenty of small time money-making schemes you can pull off--finding a money rock or growing a money tree--but if you want to make some real cash, you'll have to be a shrewd business tycoon. Pretty much all of the methods that Jake discusses breakdown to one core philosophy: overwhelm the demand with a massive supply. \n\nThat means bugs, arachnids, and the stalk market, ladies and gentlemen. Ignore the fish--too much effort for too little payoff. We're here to make money, not friends with C.J. Selling clothes and furniture also takes too much time, and time is money. \n\nHere's what you want: Peacock Butterflies and Tarantulas. Watch Jake's video for the best strategies in getting these critters to spawn (prepare yourself, you're going to need to create Tarantula Island). Then take these pricey prizes to Flick. The fellow gives you a swell deal on all things that scitter. \n\nNow you could just stop there, but you're here because you want to join the 1%. So now isn't the time to stop--the top 1% don't stop when it comes to achieving even greater wealth. Take control of your island's economy by hitting up that Stalk Market. Buy big and sell big. Now you're thinking like a Bellionaire--and with these strategies, you'll eventually be one too.\n\n#AnimalCrossing #NewHorzions #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pM0nrryc4", "date_published": "2020-04-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Let's Play Resident Evil 3 Remake", "description": "Today we check out the newest remake in the Resident Evil series.
