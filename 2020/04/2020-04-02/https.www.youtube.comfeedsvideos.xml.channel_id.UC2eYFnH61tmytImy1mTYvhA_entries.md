We recently hit both 80k subscribers (since I actually started putting up videos again (lol)), but also 12 million views total and 1,000,000 view *hours* total. Here I answer some random questions that I've hear a lot or I've heard recently. I might do another FAQ in the recent future if people have more random questions for me.
