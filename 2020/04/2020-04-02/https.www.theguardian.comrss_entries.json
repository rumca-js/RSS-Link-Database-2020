Two film posters were ubiquitous that summer: the first was for Batman, starring Michael Keaton, and the second was for Licence to Kill, starring Timothy Dalton. In the months leading up to the release of these films, I watched their trailers seemingly hundreds of times: they were both franchises about a superhero (because, really, what else is the ageless, unkillable Bond by this point?); both featured a good guy with a gun killing a lot of bad guys with guns; both lightened the bloodshed with a sprinkling of winking jokes. Yet while I queued up to see Batman the day it was released and have watched it about 3,000 times since, I not only never saw Licence to Kill but I have never watched a single Bond movie, ever. Honestly, the whole Bond thing repelled me then and repels me now.</p><p>Let\u2019s get this out of the way: it\u2019s not the sexism. I don\u2019t care that the character is a tedious sexist anachronism who shags everything, especially, if <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I63XGBqRsmw\">he\u2019s played by Roger Moore and said thing is 30 years younger</a> than him. He\u2019s from a different era \u2013 I get it. But he\u2019s such a little boy\u2019s idea of sexy machismo, with those absurd dinner jackets and perfect hair and all that wankiness about martinis. He\u2019s an issue of GQ come to life, and you know he smells of terrible Armani colognes, just like GQ does. The comedy in Batman was genuinely funny and self-satirical: \u201cCan somebody tell me what kind of world we live in where a man dressed up as a <em>bat</em> gets all of my press?\u201d. But Bond\u2019s humour is self-serving and self-satisfied, the kind beloved by people who belong to private members\u2019 clubs. In short: \u201cLet me tell you a joke that will make me look marvellous and all the rest of you stupid and little.\u201d In his 2006 book on Bond, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/08/film\">The Man Who Saved Britain</a>, Simon Winder claims this is a reflection of Britain\u2019s psyche after the loss of empire: a desire to believe that Britain \u2013 in this case, represented by Bond \u2013 was still the coolest cat in the room. I\u2019m sure Winder is right, that Bond is basically Britain in breakdown mode. But like all breakdowns, it\u2019s painful to watch.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/02/ive-never-seen-james-bond-the-spy-who-loved-me-hadley-freeman\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/02/ive-never-seen-james-bond-the-spy-who-loved-me-hadley-freeman", "date_published": "2020-04-02 13:03:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Eddie Large \u2013 a life in pictures", "description": "<p>Large, from comedy duo Little and Large, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/02/comedian-eddie-large-little-and-large-dies-after-contracting-coronavirus-son-says\">has died from coronavirus aged 78</a>.

At an emergency virtual meeting last Thursday, G20 leaders took steps in the right direction. But we are still far away from having a coordinated, articulated global response that meets the unprecedented magnitude of what we are facing.</p><p>Far from flattening the curve of infection, we are still well behind it. The disease initially took 67 days to infect 100,000 people; soon, 100,000 people and more will be infected daily. Without concerted and courageous action, the number of new cases will almost certainly escalate into the millions, pushing health systems to breaking point, economies into a nosedive and people into despair, with the poorest hit hardest.<br /><br />We must prepare for the worst and do everything to avoid it. Here is a three-point call to action \u2013 based on science, solidarity and smart policies \u2013 for doing just that.<br /><br />First, suppress transmission of the coronavirus. <br /><br />This requires aggressive and early testing and contact tracing, complemented by quarantines, treatment and measures to keep first responders safe, combined with measures to restrict movement and contact. Such steps, despite the disruptions they cause, must be sustained until therapies and a vaccine emerge. <br /><br />Crucially, this robust and cooperative effort should be guided by the World Health Organization, a member of the United Nations family; countries acting on their own \u2013 as they must for their people \u2013 will not get the job done for all.<br /><br />Second, tackle the devastating social and economic dimensions of the crisis. <br /><br />The virus is spreading like wildfire, and is likely to move swiftly into the global south, where health systems face constraints, people are more vulnerable, and millions live in densely populated slums or crowded settlements for refugees and internally displaced persons. Fuelled by such conditions, the virus could devastate the developing world and then re-emerge where it was previously suppressed. In our interconnected world, we are only as strong as the weakest health systems.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/un-secretary-general-coronavirus-crisis-world-pandemic-response\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/un-secretary-general-coronavirus-crisis-world-pandemic-response", "date_published": "2020-04-02 11:58:32+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "International Booker prize shortlist led by 28-year-old\u2019s debut", "description": "<p>The Discomfort of Evening by Marieke Lucas Rijneveld joins five other \u2018expansively imagined\u2019 novels contending for \u00a350,000 award<br /></p><p>Dutch author Marieke Lucas Rijneveld has become one of the youngest writers to be shortlisted for a Booker prize, after their debut novel made the final line-up for the International Booker.</p><p>Rijneveld, a rising star in Dutch literature, is 28 \u2013 slightly older than British author Daisy Johnson was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/20/man-booker-2018-shortlist-daisy-johnson-anna-burns-rachel-kushner-richard-powers-esi-edugyan-robin-robertson\">when she was shortlisted for the Booker prize in 2018</a>, age 27.

I pressed him to be more specific and was told bluntly that I wouldn\u2019t last a year. I would be lucky to have half that time.

It is in desperate need of research; when it is advanced there is very little effective treatment. This was not something I expected in my late 20s. Early on, after reading the bleak statistics, I started preparing myself for the inevitable. But treatment began positively and my focus changed to getting better.

Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another\u2019s space; suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we\u2019re not allowed to hug.

Coronavirus has turned etiquette on its head and what once were gestures of friendship are now acts of daring. Fundamentally, society used to run on the idea that we were all welcome in one another\u2019s space; suddenly, civility amounts to how much distance we keep between ourselves, and how much we shield others from our presence. It is one hell of a gear shift. And it is also important not to overcorrect, not to judge one another from a thousand yards, not to needlessly insult one another in situations that are not, actually, that endangering. Courtesy has never been more serious: it is the way we signal that we still care about each other, when we\u2019re not allowed to hug. So here are some answers to the questions that we are increasingly asking.</p><p><strong>This social distancing thing: how should I walk down the pavement? In the middle? On the left? On the right?
