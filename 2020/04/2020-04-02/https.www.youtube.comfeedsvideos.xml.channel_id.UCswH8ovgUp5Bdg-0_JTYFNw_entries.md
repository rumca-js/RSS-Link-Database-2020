A clip from the upcoming Under The Skin with Joe Wicks aka  "The Body Coach”.
During this Coronavirus Pandemic lockdown Joe has begun doing a daily morning YouTube Livestream "P.E With Joe" to try and help children and adults stay active.
His livestream has been viewed millions and he has around 500,000 live viewers every morning! And it has raised £85k for the NHS!
