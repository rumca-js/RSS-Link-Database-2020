Fallout 76 is adding NPCs via the Wastelanders update, which changes the post-apocalyptic online RPG in many different ways. As detailed in the video above, the expansion revamps the base game's main quest while offering its own story to experience, involving Raiders and Settlers moving into the wasteland.

Wastelanders was delayed briefly, but the expansion will come to PS4, Xbox One, and PC on April 14. The Steam version of Fallout 76 will be available one week ahead of the expansion, on April 7.

Persona's longtime character designer, Shigenori Soejima, walks us through how he gave life to the newest member of the Phantom Thieves, Kasumi Yoshizawa. He also discusses the fairy tale influences behind her Persona, Cendrillon.

It doesn't feel like four years have passed since Persona 5 was originally released in 2016. Atlus' PlayStation 4-exclusive RPG developed a fervent fanbase and, thanks to their efforts, the title has remained an ever-present part of gaming culture. Persona 5 is a game that, in more than a few ways, was built to linger in the mind and stay in conversations. It's themes and subject matter are complex and its characters are nuanced. Everything from their visual design, to their personalities and their place within the story resonated with people on a meaningful level.

It can't be easy, then, to go back and introduce something new. Changing something that such a huge number of people have fallen deeply in love with is a daunting challenge, but to have that change be a brand new character placed at the center of the story is a potentially overwhelming one. But that's exactly what Atlus has done for Persona 5 Royal, and the task of designing the new character fell upon Shigenori Soejima. 

Soejima has defined the Persona series as we know it and, many of gaming's most recognizable characters are from his mind. In this episode of Audio Logs, Soejima shows us exactly how he approaches creating a new character. More specifically, how he created Kasumi, the newest member of the Phantom Thieves, who makes her debut in Persona 5 Royal.

From the inspirations for her profile, to the fairy tale aesthetic of her Persona, Cendrillon, Soejima breaks it all down. The legendary designer puts a great deal of thought into even the smallest details and to be given insight into the thinking behind them is a rare treat, check it out above. 

You can check out more episodes of Audio Logs on YouTube, where you'll find the entirety of Season 1 of the show, as well as numerous episodes from Season 2. We've got episodes for Death Stranding, Control, Gears 5, Cuphead, and more--they're all well worth watching.

The horrifying Nemesis creature returns in the Resident Evil 3 Remake, and he's every bit as terrifying as you remember. The Nemesis attacks you multiple times in the new game, and here in this video, we're rounding up some of the most gasp-inducing moments with the beast. 

The video highlights seven encounters in all, and they're each confronting and alarming in their own unique ways. A hulking, menacing beast, Nemesis is a more intelligent bad guy who hunts down Jill and torments her basically everywhere she goes. He can use weapons, too, which makes him an even deadlier combatant. 

Be sure to watch the full video to see some of the scariest Nemesis encounters in the Resident Evil 3 Remake. One thing to note is that this video includes a look at the final boss, so if you don't want to see that, pause or stop before the end. 

Resident Evil 3 Remake launches on April 3 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Keep checking back with GameSpot for lots more on the game, including our final review score.

## How To Become A Millionaire In Animal Crossing: New Horizons

So you want to be a Bellionaire in Animal Crossing: New Horizons? Well you came to the right place--in the video above, Jake Dekker walks through three sure-fire methods for quickly earning large amounts of Bells. 

You'll have to get creative when it comes to making money in New Horizons. There are plenty of small time money-making schemes you can pull off--finding a money rock or growing a money tree--but if you want to make some real cash, you'll have to be a shrewd business tycoon. Pretty much all of the methods that Jake discusses breakdown to one core philosophy: overwhelm the demand with a massive supply. 

That means bugs, arachnids, and the stalk market, ladies and gentlemen. Ignore the fish--too much effort for too little payoff. We're here to make money, not friends with C.J. Selling clothes and furniture also takes too much time, and time is money. 

Here's what you want: Peacock Butterflies and Tarantulas. Watch Jake's video for the best strategies in getting these critters to spawn (prepare yourself, you're going to need to create Tarantula Island). Then take these pricey prizes to Flick. The fellow gives you a swell deal on all things that scitter. 

Now you could just stop there, but you're here because you want to join the 1%. So now isn't the time to stop--the top 1% don't stop when it comes to achieving even greater wealth. Take control of your island's economy by hitting up that Stalk Market. Buy big and sell big. Now you're thinking like a Bellionaire--and with these strategies, you'll eventually be one too.
