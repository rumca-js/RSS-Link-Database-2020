<p>It’s mostly about eating the hottest chillies they can find and comparing everything to testicles. But buried in this weary outing is a glimpse of the Gordon Ramsay of old</p><p>Even at the best of times, I feel I need another programme following three men – especially Gobshite Clarkson, May and the wee one – on a trip to discover/sneer at foreign coastlines/cars/cultures like I need a hole in the head. The contrived scenarios. The forced banter. The woefully scripted links. The hilarious inclusion of bloopers that are neither hilarious nor, actually, bloopers. The pitifully fragile masculinity on display throughout.</p><p>All of the above are of course present in the latest instalment of the Gordon, Gino and Fred franchise, Gordon, Gino and Fred: American Road Trip (ITV). For the avoidance of doubt, I should state that Gordon is Gordon Ramsay, of Gordon Ramsay fame, Gino is Gino d’Acampo of “beginning his career as This Morning’s chef and presenting several of his own cookery series since” fame, and Fred is Fred Sirieix of First Dates fame. It is his conciliatory charm and ineffable grace that keep the two chefs from killing each other and provide balm to the soul of any viewer who would otherwise find the whole setup too pointlessly exhausting, especially in already emotionally draining times.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/02/gordon-gino-and-fred-american-road-trip-review-its-painful-in-every-sense">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She ended gerrymandering in Michigan against all odds. Now, as the documentary Slay the Dragon arrives, Katie Fahey’s hoping the momentum is replicated in other states</p><p>For many years Michigan was divided evenly along party lines – a checkerboard of red and blue every election. Then, in 2011, Michigan’s Republican party legally rigged the system. Charged with drawing new district lines, the lawmakers did so with unprecedented precision – <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/gerrymandering-michigan-among-nations-worst-new-test-claims">carving</a> unnatural boundaries to keep their favored voters and locales in hand – to guarantee a majority for their party.</p><p>It worked perfectly. The process of creating these doctored maps, known as gerrymandering, resulted in widespread victories for the Republicans. The party controlled almost every level of government, from the state supreme court to municipal workers. And with tangible impact on Michigan’s people: the <a href="https://psmag.com/magazine/among-the-gerrymandered">Flint water crisis</a>, which killed 12 people, happened because party legislators appointed emergency managers whom voters opposed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/02/katie-fahey-slay-the-dragon-gerrymandering">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The health secretary wrote off £13bn of NHS debt, promised 100,000 tests and acted like a grownup</p><p>For much of the week, it’s been as if the government has gone out of its way to appear wilfully clueless. First, the psychotically unstable Dominic Raab, then the pathologically untrustworthy Michael Gove, culminating with the shambolically underprepared Alok Sharma. History repeating itself first as tragedy, then as farce. It was as if the only real contingency plans the government had made were for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/uk-likely-to-postpone-cop26-un-climate-talks-glasgow-coronavirus">the postponement</a> of this year’s climate change conference. Sometimes, doing absolutely nothing proves to be entirely the right option.</p><p>But cometh the hour … There are some words I thought I’d never write. Like “Thank God for Matt Hancock”. But thank God for Matt Hancock. It seemed a high-risk strategy to send out the health secretary for the daily Downing Street press conference as it was only six days since he announced that he had contracted coronavirus. And the official NHS guidance is for anyone with symptoms to self-isolate for a week.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/words-i-thought-id-never-write-thank-god-for-matt-hancock">Continue reading...</a>

Zilkha encouraged no wave band the Contortions to record a disco album, Off-White, and attracted artists who thought along similar lines to him and Esteban: the Waitresses, Don and David Was, Lizzy Mercier Descloux.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/02/cristina-no-wave-pop-cristina-monet-palaci-things-fall-apart">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on the UK’s testing failure: much to learn from Germany | Editorial

<p>Matt Hancock says our European rival did better because of its industrial strengths. But it also benefited from its political ones</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></strong></li></ul><p>Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the World Health Organization, made <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-51916707/who-head-our-key-message-is-test-test-test" title="">“test, test, test”</a> the battle cry of governments combating the coronavirus pandemic. However, the UK has been painfully slow to adopt it – with predictably disastrous results. To contain such a viral pathogen, nations must develop a test and use it to identify infected people, isolate them, and trace those they’ve had contact with. That is what South Korea and Germany are doing. It is what the United Kingdom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/absolutely-wrong-how-uk-coronavirus-test-strategy-unravelled" title="">did not</a>.</p><p>Because Downing Street underestimated the risks and moved too slowly to a regime of mass testing, the Covid-19 virus was allowed to spread faster and wider than might have been the case, by which point the materials and swabs that the tests needed were harder to procure. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/02/uk-coronavirus-live-news-updates-covid-19-testing?page=with:block-5e85c02e8f08532a0e666852#liveblog-navigation" title="">said</a> on Thursday that the resource gaps would be filled. Such promises are easily made, but experience ought to tell us to be sceptical about whether they will be met. A grim landmark was <a href="https://twitter.com/MaxCRoser/status/1245613419446693889?s=20" title="">passed</a> hours before Mr Hancock spoke. The number of daily deaths from Covid-19 surpassed those of tuberculosis.

<p>It is 100 years since Britain’s sports grounds were last used to treat the sick – none of us expected it to happen in our lifetime</p><p>In the last months of the first world war, a ship arrived at Manchester from the US, its passengers deathly ill. They were mostly southerners, infected with a powerful influenza that had overtaken them on their transatlantic journey and quickly turned into pneumonia. The matron of a nearby Red Cross hospital, Mrs Geldart, heard of their plight and took them in, at no small risk to the health of her own – mostly voluntary – staff. For the next 12 weeks her hospital struggled and suffered through the deadliest trial it had faced in four years of war.</p><p>Many patients did not recover. Those who did took rehabilitative walks on the oval sward of grass they could see from their ward windows. Their beds took up every available inch of floor space in the Old Trafford pavilion: the long room, the dressing rooms, the corridors, and even, when weather permitted, the roof. It was only a short stroll to the cricket pitch, and no one told the convalescents off for walking on it. Lancashire’s players weren’t using it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/02/elite-sports-coronavirus-cricket-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stars and entrepreneurs will find bizarre opportunities in the conspiracy-theory laced hell for ordinary folk that is the coronavirus pandemic</p><p>Spare a thought for those tasked with covering the world of showbiz in this unprecedented time of crisis (me). Celebrities have hissed backwards into their bunkers. The nightclubs they used to fall out of have shut. Every possible configuration of social media beef has been replaced with platitudes about staying indoors. They are <em>singing</em>. There is no meat on the bones to make soup from. There is nothing out here on the wastelands to write about. Do you want 1,200 words about <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/03/30/entertainment/drake-son-first-pictures-intl-scli/index.html">Drake’s pictures of his kid</a>? Do you want me to break apart <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11307308/alex-james-guide-making-booze-home/">Alex James’s scrumpy recipe</a> (“Orchards are enchanting places”)? Do you want that? Look in the mirror and gaze sternly into your own eyes. Think about this. Do you want that? You don’t want that.</p><p>The world of celebrity is changing under the dark shadow of ’rona 2020, and it’s important to recognise the hair-sprouting and the clenching bones of this sort of social puberty. What emerges from the burrows once all this has blown over will be very different from what went in. Some will not have enough celebrity credit in the bank to weather this storm (do you think the phrase “<a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/love-island/10832254/wallace-wilson-love-island-2020-contestant/">Wallace from Love Island</a>” will mean anything by the time September rolls around? It will sound like an alien screaming a dull language into your bones. It will sound like a dog throwing up). Some, without the anchor of a furloughed PR team telling them what to do, will go rogue in lockdown, emerge having done something weird on Instagram Live from their own mansion, like shaving their own head and making soup from their hair (I just keep getting the words “Miley Cyrus”, like an intrusive thought, over and over, about this), their pre-pandemic fame diminished by the actions of their pandemic lifestyle. Some will somehow emerge more famous than ever (Kylie Jenner, after wrangling her cosmetics factories into <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/kylie-jenner-hand-sanitiser-coronavirus-hospitals-kris-coty-calabasas-a9441521.html">producing hand sanitiser</a>, will somehow leave this process richer and more beloved. <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2020/04/01/chrissy-teigens-bread-recipes-coronavirus-12492201/">Chrissy Teigen’s bread recipes</a> will sweep her ever closer to an inevitable presidential run). It will be different. We don’t know how, but it will be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2020/apr/02/lee-ryan-takes-over-the-world-is-this-the-future-of-post-pandemic-celebrity">Continue reading...</a>

As it returns, its creator and stars explain how it became unmissable</p><p>You’ve rewatched The Wire, seen every episode of Friends at least twice and are starting to wonder if this is what it feels like to “complete” Netflix. But wait: there’s a world-changing, cultural juggernaut of a TV show that – while hugely popular – you may well have missed.</p><p>This week, Money Heist – or, to use its Spanish title, La Casa de Papel – begins another eight-episode run on Netflix, where it is the streaming giant’s most-watched non-English language show worldwide. The first season of the full-throttle thriller saw its gang – all code-named after major cities and memorably clad in revolutionary-red overalls and Salvador Dalí masks – break into the Royal Mint of Spain, taking 67 people hostage and literally printing money: 2.4bn euros, to be exact. It’s fair to say that the plot doesn’t quite go to plan, though it does result in three raunchy romances and an island escape. Season three, an even wilder ride, proved that for this gang loyalty is as much a motivation as loot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/02/how-money-heist-became-netflix-biggest-global-hit">Continue reading...</a>

## I've never seen … any James Bond film | Hadley Freeman

<p>Continuing our series in which writers rectify gaps in their film education, Hadley Freeman finally pops her 007 cherry with the ‘Bondiest Bond’ – The Spy Who Loved Me<br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/the-classic-film-ive-never-seen">Read all of our series about classic missed films</a></li></ul><p>I first became aware of James Bond in 1989, which was not, I have since learned from Bondologists, a vintage Bond era. Two film posters were ubiquitous that summer: the first was for Batman, starring Michael Keaton, and the second was for Licence to Kill, starring Timothy Dalton. In the months leading up to the release of these films, I watched their trailers seemingly hundreds of times: they were both franchises about a superhero (because, really, what else is the ageless, unkillable Bond by this point?); both featured a good guy with a gun killing a lot of bad guys with guns; both lightened the bloodshed with a sprinkling of winking jokes. Yet while I queued up to see Batman the day it was released and have watched it about 3,000 times since, I not only never saw Licence to Kill but I have never watched a single Bond movie, ever. Honestly, the whole Bond thing repelled me then and repels me now.</p><p>Let’s get this out of the way: it’s not the sexism. I don’t care that the character is a tedious sexist anachronism who shags everything, especially, if <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I63XGBqRsmw">he’s played by Roger Moore and said thing is 30 years younger</a> than him. He’s from a different era – I get it. But he’s such a little boy’s idea of sexy machismo, with those absurd dinner jackets and perfect hair and all that wankiness about martinis. He’s an issue of GQ come to life, and you know he smells of terrible Armani colognes, just like GQ does. The comedy in Batman was genuinely funny and self-satirical: “Can somebody tell me what kind of world we live in where a man dressed up as a <em>bat</em> gets all of my press?”. But Bond’s humour is self-serving and self-satisfied, the kind beloved by people who belong to private members’ clubs. In short: “Let me tell you a joke that will make me look marvellous and all the rest of you stupid and little.” In his 2006 book on Bond, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/08/film">The Man Who Saved Britain</a>, Simon Winder claims this is a reflection of Britain’s psyche after the loss of empire: a desire to believe that Britain – in this case, represented by Bond – was still the coolest cat in the room. I’m sure Winder is right, that Bond is basically Britain in breakdown mode. But like all breakdowns, it’s painful to watch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/02/ive-never-seen-james-bond-the-spy-who-loved-me-hadley-freeman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We must ensure a sufficiently global and coordinated response to the pandemic, then build resilience for the future</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Only by coming together will the world be able to face down the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">C</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">ovid-19 pandemic </a>and its shattering consequences. At an emergency virtual meeting last Thursday, G20 leaders took steps in the right direction. But we are still far away from having a coordinated, articulated global response that meets the unprecedented magnitude of what we are facing.</p><p>Far from flattening the curve of infection, we are still well behind it. The disease initially took 67 days to infect 100,000 people; soon, 100,000 people and more will be infected daily. Without concerted and courageous action, the number of new cases will almost certainly escalate into the millions, pushing health systems to breaking point, economies into a nosedive and people into despair, with the poorest hit hardest.<br /><br />We must prepare for the worst and do everything to avoid it. Here is a three-point call to action – based on science, solidarity and smart policies – for doing just that.<br /><br />First, suppress transmission of the coronavirus. <br /><br />This requires aggressive and early testing and contact tracing, complemented by quarantines, treatment and measures to keep first responders safe, combined with measures to restrict movement and contact. Such steps, despite the disruptions they cause, must be sustained until therapies and a vaccine emerge. <br /><br />Crucially, this robust and cooperative effort should be guided by the World Health Organization, a member of the United Nations family; countries acting on their own – as they must for their people – will not get the job done for all.<br /><br />Second, tackle the devastating social and economic dimensions of the crisis. <br /><br />The virus is spreading like wildfire, and is likely to move swiftly into the global south, where health systems face constraints, people are more vulnerable, and millions live in densely populated slums or crowded settlements for refugees and internally displaced persons. Fuelled by such conditions, the virus could devastate the developing world and then re-emerge where it was previously suppressed. In our interconnected world, we are only as strong as the weakest health systems.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/un-secretary-general-coronavirus-crisis-world-pandemic-response">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Change is coming to the UK, when this crisis is over. Unless progressives have a plan, they will lose out like they did in 2008</p><p>It can take a grave national crisis to fire a flare, revealing the ugliest features of a society defined by injustices that the wealthy and powerful would rather forget. It took the second world war to achieve what the Jarrow hunger marches of the 1930s struggled for: to illustrate the national shame that millions of people who were called upon to make grand sacrifices were afflicted by poverty and malnourishment. As child evacuees with hungry bellies arrived on the doorsteps of the relatively well-to-do, the other Britain could no longer be ignored. “A revolutionary moment in the world’s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching,” declared William Beveridge as he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/poor-report-75-years-william-beveridge-britain-inequality-tories">laid the foundations for the post</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/05/poor-report-75-years-william-beveridge-britain-inequality-tories">war welfare state</a>. Unprecedented state direction of the economy meant that Labour’s ambitious programme of nationalisation no longer seemed quite so scary. The old order perished in the rubble of war-ravaged Britain.</p><p>Coronavirus has done two things: it has magnified existing social crises and has proved that the government can act decisively when the will is there. Millions are only ever one pay packet away from destitution; the self-employed and gig economy workers lack security and basic rights; private tenants are at the mercy of their landlords; our welfare state is woefully inadequate; and many designated “key workers” are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/07/second-class-nhs-workers-struggle-as-pay-gap-widens">desperately undervalued and badly paid</a>.

## Terminal cancer means I won't see the other side of lockdown | Elliot Dallen

<p>I imagined spending my last weeks with friends. Isolated in my flat, I’m having to rethink what a ‘good death’ might be</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></p><p>As I was lying in a hospital bed last July after complications arising from chemotherapy, my oncologist entered the room with my scan results. Hospital had become familiar to me but his next words weren’t. The treatment wasn’t working. There was little else that could be done. I pressed him to be more specific and was told bluntly that I wouldn’t last a year. I would be lucky to have half that time. This was nine months ago, before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">-19</a>, and I’m very unlikely to be alive to see the other side of lockdown.</p><p>Almost two years ago, as summer in London was just beginning, an ultrasound to investigate a bladder infection found a large tumour on my right adrenal gland that had spread to my lungs. I was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/adrenocortical/patient/adrenocortical-treatment-pdq">adrenocortical carcinoma</a>, an extremely rare and aggressive cancer. It is in desperate need of research; when it is advanced there is very little effective treatment. This was not something I expected in my late 20s. Early on, after reading the bleak statistics, I started preparing myself for the inevitable. But treatment began positively and my focus changed to getting better. When death isn’t staring you in the face, it is easy to push back the difficult thoughts and conversations. Dying was something to address later.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/terminal-cancer-lockdown-death">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rihanna shows how it’s done with her durag on the cover of this month’s Vogue, while the #DontRushChallenge showcases black women’s makeup skills in all its diverse glory. I’m off to find a lipstick to match my slippers ... <br /></p><p>Rihanna, the reigning queen of stay-at-home couture, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/mar/31/rihanna-makes-history-did-i-ever-imagine-that-i-would-see-a-durag-on-the-cover-of-vogue">made history yesterday</a>, appearing on the cover of British Vogue in a durag, the choice of bedtime headwear for many black people. Way ahead of last year’s nightwear as a daywear trend, she previously donned one covered in Swarovski crystals at the CFDA awards in 2014. In 2013, she wore a doobie wrap – a common interim style black women use to keep freshly treated hair intact during the night – at the American Music awards. Her taste in headgear makes me feel much more chic as I work from home in a polyester durag and oversized shirt.</p><p>I miss going out, but I miss getting ready to go out probably just as much, if not more. And it’s not just me – as the #OOTD hashtag declines during lockdown, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2020/mar/16/work-from-home-fashion-is-a-dressing-gown-and-underpants-the-best-option">@wfhfits Instagram account</a>, which documents the showstopping outfits contributors are wearing to work from home, is now 18.4k strong. The #DontRushChallenge takes this to the next level. Started by Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/lase_asoloo">@lase_asoloo</a>, participants go from drab to fab in the (slickly edited) tap of a makeup brush. Much like the DMX Challenge – which last year saw women showcasing various hairstyles synced to the 46 names the rapper lists on his song What They Really Want – the #DontRushChallenge is dominated by #blackgirlmagic and has been an utter joy to watch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/02/why-im-celebrating-the-women-in-lockdown-who-get-all-dressed-up-with-nowhere-to-go">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mass internment camps did not begin or end with the Nazis – today they are everywhere from China to Europe to the US. How can we stop their spread? By Daniel Trilling</p><p>At the start of the 21st century, the following things did not exist. In the US, a large network of purpose-built immigration prisons, some of which are run for profit. In western China, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/china-cables-leak-no-escapes-reality-china-uighur-prison-camp" title="">“political education” camps</a> designed to hold hundreds of thousands of people, supported by a high-tech surveillance system. In Syria, a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/aug/18/saydnaya-prison-syria-assad-amnesty-reconstruction" title="">prison complex</a> dedicated to the torture and mass execution of civilians. In north-east India, a <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-india-politics-citizenship-camp/as-they-build-indias-first-camp-for-illegals-some-workers-fear-detention-there-idUKKCN1VT00S" title="">detention centre</a> capable of holding 3,000 people who may have lived in the country for decades but are unable to prove they are citizens. In Myanmar, rural <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/04/un-warns-of-possible-new-war-crimes-in-myanmar" title="">encampments</a> where thousands of people are being forced to live on the basis of their ethnicity. On small islands and in deserts at the edges of wealthy regions – Greece’s Aegean islands, the Negev Desert in Israel, the Pacific Ocean near Australia, the southern Mediterranean coastline – various types of large holding centres for would-be migrants.</p><p>The scale and purpose of these places vary considerably, as do the political regimes that have created them, but they share certain things in common. Most were established as temporary or “emergency” measures, but have outgrown their original stated purpose and become seemingly permanent. Most exist thanks to a mix of legal ambiguity – detention centres operating outside the regular prison system, for instance – and physical isolation. And most, if not all, have at times been described by their critics as concentration camps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/why-concentration-camps-are-still-with-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Studying the past is futile in an unprecedented crisis. Science is the answer – and open-source information is paramount</p><p>• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a><br />• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></p><p>Wherever we look, there is a demand for data about Covid-19. We devour <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html">dashboards</a>, <a href="https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest">graphs</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data">visualisations</a>. We want to know about the numbers of tests, cases and deaths; how many beds and ventilators are available, how many NHS workers are off sick. When information is missing, we speculate about what the government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/coronavirus-minister-hints-u-turn-decision-stop-daily-uk-updates">might be hiding</a>, or fill in the gaps with anecdotes.</p><p>Data is a necessary ingredient in day-to-day decision-making – but in this rapidly evolving situation, it’s especially vital. Everything has changed, almost overnight. Demands for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/21/uk-military-planners-drafted-in-to-help-feed-vulnerable-in-covid-19-outbreak">food</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/20/train-services-across-britain-to-be-stripped-back-from-monday">transport</a>, and <a href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/experts-react-covid-19-impacts-energy-sector">energy</a> have been overhauled as more people stop travelling and work from home. Jobs have been lost in some sectors, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/uk-farmers-fear-huge-labour-shortfall-despite-interest-in-land-army">workers are desperately needed in others</a>. Historic experience can no longer tell us how our society or economy is working. Past models hold little predictive power in an unprecedented situation. To know what is happening right now, we need up-to-date information.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/government-publish-data-coronavirus-deaths">Continue reading...</a>
