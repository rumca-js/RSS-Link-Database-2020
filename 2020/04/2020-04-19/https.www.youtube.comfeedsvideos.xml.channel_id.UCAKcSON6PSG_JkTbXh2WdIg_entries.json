Back-up vocalists join him during the studio version of \"Cold Little Heart,\" but here, he's on his own. He normally uses electric guitar in \"The Final Frame,\" but as he sways through it at The Current, it's all #acoustic. His album is \"dense and full,\" he says, and he's right -- but these recordings strip the songs down to their bones.\n\nSONGS\n00:00 Love & Hate\n04:41 The Final Frame\n08:45 Cold Little Heart\n\nMORE FROM THIS SESSION\nCold Little Heart https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIBtqXj3Ftk\nLove & Hate https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wfotg_q5Bkc\n\nAll songs from Michael Kiwanuka's 2016 release, Love & Hate, available via Interscope Records.\n\nCREDITS\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\nAudio: Michael DeMark and Matt Lentz\nVideo: by Nate Ryan\n\nSUPPORT THE CURRENT\nhttps://support.mpr.org/current-web?var=youtube-description\n\n#michaelkiwanuka", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRh_-tKHe3o", "date_published": "2020-04-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "One World concert raises $128 million to fight COVID-19 (The Current Music News)", "description": "April 20, 2020: An all-star, live-streamed concert called 'One World: Together at Home' raised $128 million to fight the coronavirus.
