In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They\u2019re recorded by the artists in their home. It\u2019s the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nDid you know you can watch new Tiny Desk concerts on npr.org ONE WEEK before they go up on YouTube?

That's what happened when T\u014dth played the Tiny Desk. I felt a deep connection to both the fun and emotion in their music. Besides, I loved their outfits. The last time we saw Alex Toth at the Tiny Desk, he was standing against the shelves, trumpet to his lips. He performed in 2015 with Rubblebucket and his partner Kalmia Travers was singing lead. This time around, Alex sings about their relationship's end in the song \"Copilot.\"\n\n\"Thought you were my copilot na na na\nMy copilot na na na na na\nNow I know that you were just taking me for a ride\nAnd that's alright it was a beautiful ride.\"\n\n\"Copilot\" is one of two songs T\u014dth performed at the Tiny Desk from his album Practice Magic and Seek Professional Help When Necessary. These songs are thoughtful, honest reflections on the end of his personal relationship with Kalmia Travers (although it continues professionally). The arrangements here are spare but textured with bits of Alex on trumpet and touches from Ben Chapoteau-Katz on sax and electronics. The rhythm section of drummer Rebecca Lasaponaro and bassist Ryan Dugre pin it all together. There is a debut here, before the ending singalong song. The new tune \"Turnaround (Cocaine Song)\" is a funny/sad (and I'll assume true) tale of poorly timed indulgence at his Aunt Mary's funeral in New Jersey. The balance of storytelling and intriguing music are my sweet spots, so T\u014dth felt right at home at my desk.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Copilot\"\n\"No Reason\"\n\"Turnaround (Cocaine Song)\"\n\"Juliette\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAlex Toth: vocals, guitar, trumpet; Ryan Dugre: bass, vocals; Ben Chapoteau-Katz: synthesizer, sax, vocals; Rebecca Lasaponaro: drums, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith, Jack Corbett; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, Alex Drewenskus; Videographers: Maia Stern, Melany Rochester, Jack Corbett, Bronson Arcuri; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Max Posner/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D0yLOK7z30", "date_published": "2020-04-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "The Low Anthem: NPR Music Tiny Desk From The Archives", "description": "We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube! \nWatch The Low Anthem\u2019s Tiny Desk concert from 2010:\nhttps://www.npr.org/2010/01/20/122589471/the-low-anthem-tiny-desk-concert\n\nBob Boilen | January 20, 2010\n\nThis past summer in Newport, R.I., I saw The Low Anthem perform as part of the Newport Folk Festival's 50th anniversary. I had heard the band's album Oh My God, Charlie Darwin early that year and found it simple, gorgeous and thought-provoking. It's hard to do what The Low Anthem does so well \u2014 play sullen, spacious music \u2014 at a noisy and crowded music festival. But it did, and it won over an awful lot of fans in the process.\n\nLater, I was talking to Jay Sweet, who picks much of the talent that comes to Newport these days, and I told him how taken I was by The Low Anthem. Sweet replied, \"These guys are from around here. Last year, they were volunteers at the festival, picking up trash.\"\n\nI love that story, and I love this band's spirit. When The Low Anthem came to NPR Music to play a Tiny Desk Concert, the band seemed humbled and comfortable sitting on and around my desk, playing music as if it were hanging around in someone's living room. So grab something warm to drink, gather 'round, and pay special attention to the cell-phone trick at the end of \"This God Damn House\" \u2014 it's something else.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UanRDr0m4IU", "date_published": "2020-04-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
