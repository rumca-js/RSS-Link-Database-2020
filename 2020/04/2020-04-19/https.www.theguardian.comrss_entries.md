<p>Lockdown decluttering has led me down a path to the fascinating, well-lived life of a larrikin named Aubrey Hodgson</p><p>A recent lockdown clear-out prompted the discovery of a semi-skimmed and long-forgotten letter forwarded to me by my mother some years ago; a piece of correspondence she had chanced upon while doing some domestic decluttering of her own. It had been written by my uncle, a former professor of anatomy at the University of Galway, during his days doing the rounds at a Sydney hospital way back in 1978.</p><p>Writing to my father on the flimsiest of airmail notepaper, with a neatness of hand that belied his profession, he revealed that he had been lucky enough to get talking to “a very interesting character” the previous evening. A legendary figure known in Australian rugby circles as the Bull, Aubrey Hodgson had been singing the praises of the Ireland lock Willie John McBride and the Welsh fly-half Barry John, two titans of the northern hemisphere game the former Wallabies forward, then aged 66, hugely admired.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/20/australia-maverick-aubrey-hodgson-rugby-union">Continue reading...</a>

After several hours of vetting, we grew confident of the broker’s professional pedigree and the potential to secure a large shipment of three-ply face masks and N95 respirators. The latter were KN95 respirators, N95s that were made in China. We received samples to confirm that they could be successfully fit-tested. Despite having cleared this hurdle, we remained concerned that the samples might not be representative of the bulk of the products that we would be buying. Having acquired the requisite funds – more than five times the amount we would normally pay for a similar shipment, but still less than what was being requested by other brokers – we set the plan in motion. Three members of the supply-chain team and a fit tester were flown to a small airport near an industrial warehouse in the mid-Atlantic region. <strong>I arrived by car to make the final call on whether to execute the deal.

## Starwatch: Lyrid meteor shower will put on a stellar show

<p>Spotting the 10-15 meteors per hour expected at event’s peak will be challenging, but not impossible </p><p>This week’s must-see naked-eye celestial event is the Lyrid meteor shower. This is one of the oldest meteor showers, with Chinese references dating back to more than 2,500 years ago. Modern analysis shows that the meteors are dust ejected by Comet Thatcher, which orbits the sun once every 415 years. Currently in the depths of the outer solar system, Comet Thatcher will return in the year 2276.</p><p>The Lyrids are an active meteor shower from 16 to 25 April, but the peak this week could happen in the early hours of 22 April or later that night as 22 becomes 23 April. They are called Lyrids because they emanate from a point in the constellation Lyra, the lyre. Between 10-15 moderately bright meteors are expected per hour at the storm’s peak. The chart shows the view looking north-east from London on 22 April at 11pm BST. Unfortunately, Lyra never rises very high in the southern hemisphere. This will make seeing the Lyrids challenging, but not impossible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/19/starwatch-lyrid-meteor-shower-will-put-on-a-stellar-show">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on lockdown reading: more than escapism | Editorial

<p>It’s no surprise that people read a lot when stuck at home. But novels are more than a way to kill time</p><p>It’s no surprise that keen readers have looked to books for historical analogues or literary insights into the coronavirus outbreak. Sales of the English translation of Albert Camus’s 1947 novel La Peste (The Plague) are<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/albert-camus-novel-the-plague-la-peste-pestilence-fiction-coronavirus-lockdown" title=""> reported to have risen</a> by around 1,000% in recent weeks. Daniel Defoe’s A Journal of the Plague Year, Don DeLillo’s White Noise and Lucy Hughes-Hallett’s Peculiar Ground have also all seen their mentions rise. So have other volumes with contagious disease or dystopian themes, presumably because readers hope they might shed some light on our unprecedented global situation.</p><p>Of course there is more time for things like reading when we are stuck at home, unable to socialise or go to museums and concerts – or to borrow books, since libraries are shut. But it is notable that fiction sales, along with home-learning titles, experienced the greatest boost as the UK’s lockdown began, because this indicates that it is not facts that people are after, but stories.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/the-guardian-view-on-lockdown-reading-not-just-a-way-of-escaping">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a five-floor house on a leafy square, an art history fan has created his dream home – a Georgian blend of English and Dutch styling</p><p>Glimpsed through half-open doors, the panelled rooms of Frank Hollmeyer’s Georgian terraced house remind you of a Dutch old master painting. Light slants across wooden floors; paintings and porcelain are arranged as if in a painting by Vermeer. For Hollmeyer, an art historian by training, those 17th-century artists excelled “at intimate scenes of everyday domesticity, where everything feels composed”.</p><p>It’s an approach he’s applied here. The five-storey house, set on a shady garden square in south London, is Hollmeyer’s “canvas”. It’s where he takes a quiet pleasure in re-ordering books or piling a blue and white Delft bowl with fruit, like an artist tweaking a composition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/19/old-master-makeover-an-art-history-fans-dream-home">Continue reading...</a>

He moved on, initially to Midtjylland in Denmark, and after a spell at AIK in Sweden he joined Krasnodar in January 2019. This season he has been a key player in midfield, with his team second in Russia’s Premier League.</p><p><strong>Aston Villa – Pierluigi Gollini (Atalanta)</strong> A £4.25m signing from the Serie B side Hellas Verona in 2016, Gollini held down a first-team spot for barely four months before Steve Bruce brought in Mark Bunn, more than 10 years Gollini’s senior, before Christmas. “Bunn gives you that bit of experience,” he said. “I just felt with young Pier, it was a bit too much for him. I find him very young.” The following month he joined Atalanta, initially on loan, and he has been their first-choice goalkeeper since March 2019. He has had an outstanding season and made his full international debut in November.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/19/from-srloth-to-luis-alberto-20-players-who-have-thrived-after-leaving-england">Continue reading...</a>

## EOB: Earth review – Radiohead's Ed O'Brien goes eclectic

<p>(Polydor)<br /></p><p>“I’m not a Ronaldo or a Rooney: that’s Thom and Jonny,” said Radiohead’s<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/23/radioheads-40-greatest-songs-ranked"> </a>second guitarist, <a href="https://www.eobmusic.com/">Ed O’Brien</a>, in 2008. “But in my dreams I’m a Paul Scholes.” Thirty-five years in the same band leaves a lot of dream time – particularly when your bandmates are on to their second or third acclaimed releases with various solo, soundtrack and side projects – and O’Brien’s debut album, worked on since 2012, finally gives free rein to the creative playmaker behind his unassuming, dedicated team-player persona. <em>Earth</em>, inspired by Carl Sagan and <em>Screamadelica</em>, is eclectic, its shapeshifting songs spinning through folky ambience, euphoric electronics and pulsing dance-rock.</p><p>It’s best when subtlest – the brooding Mass, its guitars a tense electrical crackle – worst when, as on Deep Days, it recalls Badly Drawn Boy or millennium U2. “Vanity project” would be a cruel name for such a genuine album, but if O’Brien was someone else, it wouldn’t have been produced by Flood, released by Polydor, or feature Portishead’s Adrian Utley, Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche or, on the closing folksy duet Cloak of the Night, Laura Marling. Ultimately, <em>Earth</em>, for all its ambition, will mainly be of interest to Radiohead completists, who are now just missing the bassist: over to you, Colin Greenwood. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/19/eob-earth-review-radiohead-ed-obrien-debut-album">Continue reading...</a>

You are not alone. It seems like the people responsible for conveying information all have different messages with separate agendas. From our local media to our governing officials all the way up to the man in the suit. In this most dire of times, there have been displays of dissidence, and controversy from our political elites, causing confusion among the public. If that last sentence applies to you, our frustrations are shared. With that being said, it is paramount that everyone remains calm.

<p>It’s the data that gets all the headlines, but the two main sources of information in the UK have their own limits</p><p>“Nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.” Right? Well, not quite. As many people are discovering during the Covid-19 crisis, even something as seemingly straightforward as the count of people who have died might not be as robust as to be taken at face value. In the UK, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/care-homes-coronavirus-why-we-dont-know-true-uk-death-toll">distinctions between the data</a> from the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have led to talk of whether deaths are being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/care-homes-coronavirus-why-we-dont-know-true-uk-death-toll">underestimated</a> and even whether the figures can be <a href="https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-can-we-trust-the-covid-19-death-toll">trusted</a>.</p><p>The pandemic highlights several difficulties in counting, reporting and modelling mortality data. Arguably, the most important problem is the “denominator” – what is the actual number of people who are infected by the virus? This is virtually impossible to determine, except perhaps in the unlikely scenario of real-time, continuous, population-wide testing. The absence of this figure creates problems when rescaling the outcomes – for example, deaths – to the number of people at risk, which is not known with precision. And because we cannot know for certain the total number of infected, international comparisons also become tricky: <a href="https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases">does Germany have more cases</a> than the UK because it tests more and reports the results more systematically?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/19/coronavirus-deaths-data-uk">Continue reading...</a>

## Is the cruise industry finally out of its depth?

<p>Accidents, pollution, exploitation… cruise firms were in murky waters even before Covid-19</p><p>“We’ve been asked – and we’ve asked ourselves – why <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-thursday">Covid-19</a> seems to be impacting Princess so heavily.” Thus spoke Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises, in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC1jVkY9hqE">video posted</a> on social media in mid-March. She looks sad-eyed and baffled into the camera: “We don’t really know.” Perhaps, she muses, the problem is something to do with the “diverse mix of people onboard our ships” and is “being magnified by our core values to respect, protect and connect the world”. She implores her “guests” with a “simple request”: “We ask you to book a future Princess cruise to your dream destination … as a symbol to the world that the things that connect us are stronger than those that divide us.” </p><p>Her company does seem to have been terribly unlucky. Their <a href="https://www.ship-technology.com/news/covid-19-diamond-princess-cruise-ship-eighth-death/">Diamond Princess</a>, quarantined off Yokohama, which suffered over 700 infections and eight deaths among its passengers and crew, was a conspicuous early victim of the pandemic, its global fame growing on wry-turning-to-desperate postings from its passengers. The Ruby Princess, from which 2,700 passengers disembarked in Sydney on March 19, became the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/criminal-investigation-launched-ruby-princess-cruise-ship-coronavirus-disaster">single largest source of Covid-19 cases in Australia</a>. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/from-paradise-to-coronavirus-the-grand-princess-and-the-cruise-from-hell">Grand Princess</a> was stuck outside San Francisco, its passengers confined to their cabins, after an outbreak in early March.

Her formerly blonde, newly pale-pink hair lights her up like a beacon, but I have arrived a little early, and she looks so quiet and self-contained, so tucked into herself and thoughtful, that I have a strong urge to turn around and leave her to it. I had heard she was a talker, expected the gregarious character that is larger-than-life in her videos, but my first impressions are that perhaps she won’t be much of a talker at all.</p><p>Within two minutes of sitting down, I know this about the woman born Anne-Marie Rose Nicholson: the name of her nephew, where she lives, where she grew up, why she’s baffled that her Wikipedia says her dad is Irish (he’s from east London), the results of a DNA test she did to find out her ancestry and the fact that she wrote a whole album that she decided to scrap, because she realised that what she’d come up with was too “ratchet”. The idea was, she explains, that it would be a reversal of the wronged woman situation she had picked apart on her debut album, <em>Speak Your Mind</em>. She started writing about being the cheater, rather than the cheated-on. “I feel like in the first album, I had struggles, and I was trying to get through that by writing them down, and then when I came to write the second album, I was like, yeah, I feel fucking great. I feel great in myself, I feel confident, so the whole album was really…” She starts laughing. “It was too much! It was so horrible. I was like, I don’t care, I want to be different now, and then it wasn’t until I did a show somewhere and this dad came over to me and said, ‘I just want to say, I’m so happy that my daughter listens to you because you’re a really great [role model],’ and I was like…” She clicks her fingers and grins. “I’m not releasing that album!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/19/anne-marie-i-just-want-to-make-people-smile">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Frank Herfort’s pictures of post-Soviet Russia capture absurd contrasts between the state’s ambitions and ordinary life</p><p>Frank Herfort, a German photographer, has been working on a series of pictures he calls “Russian fairytales” for the past 15 years. He grew up in Leipzig and spent his childhood under communism, then his teens, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, under capitalism; he was fascinated to see familiar streetscapes colonised by advertising hoardings. His career has reflected that dichotomy. He has worked as a commercial photographer to fund an enduring fascination with the post-Soviet atmospheres of the east. When fellow art students relocated to London or Berlin after graduating, he settled in Moscow and began making photographs of the city’s interiors, taking his Hasselblad camera into waiting rooms and tiled hotel lobbies and curious bars, alive to juxtaposition and surreal comedy.</p><p>This picture was taken in the meadows on the banks of the River Moscow, on the fringe of the 850th anniversary park. The contrast in scale and tone between the picnicking mother and her toddler and the vast, foreboding architecture of the electricity pylons is typical of Herfort’s work. He is drawn to scenes in which people innocently inhabit places slightly beyond their understanding, as if they have been dropped there from a different time and place altogether.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/19/the-big-picture-lifes-a-picnic-on-the-banks-of-the-river-moscow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>You seem detached from your own desires, says Mariella Frostrup. Think about whether this represents a long-standing emotional issue and get professional help</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>My boyfriend and I have been dating for four years and I have faked my orgasm each time we’ve had sex. We met at university when I had a distorted view of what sex should be like. I was in a wild period of my life and I slept with a lot of different guys. Faking it was a way of ending the sex when I wasn’t enjoying it any more – and I thought it was the easiest way to communicate that I was done.</em></p><p><em>But since I faked it with him the first time, I thought I had to fake it the second time, and so on. The longer </em><em>it’s gone on, the harder it has become to tell him, because I am afraid of losing him. He is very thoughtful and patient. If I had told him earlier we could’ve moved past it, but I </em><em>was too afraid. The worst thing is that our relationship is amazing. We have a mutual sense of trust and respect. I don’t want to ruin it, but I feel like I already have. I know now that the goal of sex is enjoyment, </em><em>but my guilt is starting to take over my thoughts and I don’t know what to do. The truth would hurt him and probably knock his whole sense of trust and self-worth. There has to be another way to fix this, right?</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/19/ive-faked-every-one-of-my-orgasms-over-the-past-four-years">Continue reading...</a>
