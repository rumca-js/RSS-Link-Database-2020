This performance was recorded on Feb. 7, 2020. We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They’re recorded by the artists in their home. It’s the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

April 13, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Sometimes I'll see a band at my desk and wish I could jump in and join. That's what happened when Tōth played the Tiny Desk. I felt a deep connection to both the fun and emotion in their music. Besides, I loved their outfits. The last time we saw Alex Toth at the Tiny Desk, he was standing against the shelves, trumpet to his lips. He performed in 2015 with Rubblebucket and his partner Kalmia Travers was singing lead. This time around, Alex sings about their relationship's end in the song "Copilot."

"Thought you were my copilot na na na
My copilot na na na na na
Now I know that you were just taking me for a ride
And that's alright it was a beautiful ride."

"Copilot" is one of two songs Tōth performed at the Tiny Desk from his album Practice Magic and Seek Professional Help When Necessary. These songs are thoughtful, honest reflections on the end of his personal relationship with Kalmia Travers (although it continues professionally). The arrangements here are spare but textured with bits of Alex on trumpet and touches from Ben Chapoteau-Katz on sax and electronics. The rhythm section of drummer Rebecca Lasaponaro and bassist Ryan Dugre pin it all together. There is a debut here, before the ending singalong song. The new tune "Turnaround (Cocaine Song)" is a funny/sad (and I'll assume true) tale of poorly timed indulgence at his Aunt Mary's funeral in New Jersey. The balance of storytelling and intriguing music are my sweet spots, so Tōth felt right at home at my desk.

We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Bob Boilen | January 20, 2010

This past summer in Newport, R.I., I saw The Low Anthem perform as part of the Newport Folk Festival's 50th anniversary. I had heard the band's album Oh My God, Charlie Darwin early that year and found it simple, gorgeous and thought-provoking. It's hard to do what The Low Anthem does so well — play sullen, spacious music — at a noisy and crowded music festival. But it did, and it won over an awful lot of fans in the process.

Later, I was talking to Jay Sweet, who picks much of the talent that comes to Newport these days, and I told him how taken I was by The Low Anthem. Sweet replied, "These guys are from around here. Last year, they were volunteers at the festival, picking up trash."

I love that story, and I love this band's spirit. When The Low Anthem came to NPR Music to play a Tiny Desk Concert, the band seemed humbled and comfortable sitting on and around my desk, playing music as if it were hanging around in someone's living room. So grab something warm to drink, gather 'round, and pay special attention to the cell-phone trick at the end of "This God Damn House" — it's something else.
