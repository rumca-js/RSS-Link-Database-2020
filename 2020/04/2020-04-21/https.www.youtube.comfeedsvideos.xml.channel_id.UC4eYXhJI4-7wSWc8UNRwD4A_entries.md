April 22, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- Whenever I'm asked to name my favorite Tiny Desk concerts, Nick Hakim's 2018 performance sits near the very top. He and his four bandmates reset the bar for intimacy at the Desk with their hushed groove. That's why I was so excited to hear what he would do all alone from his home in Bushwick, Brooklyn.

The Washington, D.C. native played from the corner of his dark bedroom with a keyboard, guitar and stacks of audio components. His recording environment is just what I expected. He performs a three songs from his upcoming album WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD: a haunting dedication to a fallen friend, "QADIR," the newly released "CRUMPY" and the premiere of "GODS DIRTY WORK." He also shows off his peculiar sense of humor, activating a mini applause effect between songs, sipping his beverage right into the microphone and breaking into laughter. While he doesn't engage in much banter, the lyrics in songs like "GODS DIRTY WORK" are eerily fitting for this moment we're in.

SET LIST:

"CRUMPY"
"GODS DIRTY WORK"
"QADIR"

In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They’re recorded by the artists in their home.

April 15, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Angelica Garcia decorated the Tiny Desk with colorful fabrics, orange flowers, a fuchsia dress, and a great deal of pride in what she calls her "Salva-Mex-American" heritage. Her song "Orange Flower" got my attention back in 2016, but I thought of her only as a Virginia rock and roller. Not anymore. Angelica Garcia's music in the 2020s embraces her heritage, her life growing up in Los Angeles, and the ranchero music she heard from her family. Angelica moved to Virginia at age seventeen. The songs she sings at the Tiny Desk, all from her album Cha Cha Palace, reflect the way she was seen, or more to the point, not seen, in her new home. "Jícama" captures that feeling of invisibility:

"I see you, but you don't see me
Jícama, jícama, guava tree
I been trying to tell ya but you just don't see
Like you, I was born in this country."

On the opening song, "Guadalupe," Angelica expresses respect for La Virgen de Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, singing "I wanna be like her." Guadalupe inspires her to declare that "power isn't defined by your physique." In this Tiny Desk concert, Angelica, along with her Richmond bandmates, powerfully convey the all-important message that we are all part of this country's colorful fabric, and we all deserve to be heard.

SET LIST
"Guadalupe"
"Valentina in the Moonlight"
"Jícama"
