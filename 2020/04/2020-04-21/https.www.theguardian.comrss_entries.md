<p>This Supershoppers special takes two Amazon-devoted families on an eye-opening tour of the retailers’ tactics – with mixed results</p><p>I forget how much of an unbearable metropolitan elitist I am sometimes. When I see a programme called The Truth About Amazon, I automatically think it’s going to be an excoriating investigation into some of the alleged abuses of its workers. These are so many that, taken together, they would amount to something remarkably close to servitude, even before the new claims of failures to protect its people (or provide such things as hazard pay) started since the pandemic began. Or its viciously anti-union stance, or how a company making £11bn a year pays less tax than a pet hamster, or whether the invisible hand of the market is really enough to keep western capitalism from ultimately destroying us all ...</p><p>You get, I’m sure, the idea. In fact, last night’s <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-truth-about-amazon">The Truth About Amazon</a> on Channel 4, presented by Sabrina Grant and Helen Skelton, was a Supershoppers special, attacking it from that programme’s usual consumer rights perspective. This will probably do at least as much to problematise punters’ immediate relationship with the retail giant-of-giants as would another handwringing article about its tentacular reach into more and more aspects of our lives. Not to mention Jeff Bezos’s likely ultimate plan to strangle us all in our beds as we sleep and turn our bodies into fuel for his behemoth once it gains sentience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/the-truth-about-amazon-review-punters-guide-">Continue reading...</a>

Their goal is to find a home in rivers, lakes and ponds while growing darker and larger for up to 10 years.

Over the past month, countless businesses have had to adapt to survive. Selling more online, having meetings over Zoom, that kind of thing. Yet for its first day back in session, the Commons was struggling big time to adjust. It took more than an hour for a handful of MPs to agree some fairly basic procedures. Everything was most irregular. The like of which had not been seen since 1349.</p><p>You could tell we were in trouble right from the off as it was Jacob Rees-Mogg who was easily the most enthusiastic moderniser in the Commons. What he was proposing all seemed entirely sensible. Not to mention straightforward. Fifty MPs in the house at any one time, with another 120 logging in online. No tricky votes for at least a week as no one had yet worked out how to make the system work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/21/no-votes-no-tough-questions-mps-struggle-with-life-after-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

Some people are perfectly clear: they wouldn’t touch responsibility with a disinfected barge pole. Others fancy the power or, all too often, the money.</p><p>It is uncommonly rare, particularly in sports administration, to find people genuinely keen to do it for altruistic reasons, for the benefit of the many rather than the few, or because they possess far-sighted vision and intelligence. Rugby, more than most, could do with a few more in the lesser-spotted latter category.

Dozens of well-funded laboratories were on the case and a solution seemed within the grasp of researchers. Thirty years on and there’s no HIV vaccine. This sobering fact ought to bring us up short. We want to believe that a treatment for Covid-19 is just around the corner. But we must steel ourselves that a vaccine, as the head of the Wellcome Trust <a href="https://twitter.com/wellcometrust/status/1251810174131736576?s=20" title="">warned</a>, is not a given.</p><p>While no expense should be <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-uk-vaccine-to-be-trialled-on-patients-from-thursday-says-matt-hancock-11976681" title="">spared</a> to find a vaccine, the UK government must also display the wherewithal to design an administrative system to support and enable the public to live with this threat.

<p>The fiercely private pop star is in lockdown with her five kids – and has turned her home into a weekly live-streamed party.

The live-streamed party, during which she interrupted her hit song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6gLOmjP5GY">Take Me Home</a> (the lyrics changed to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZu3eOQU06E">“stay at home”</a>) to tell one of her children: “Don’t step on the baby!” has become a weekly event to look forward to.</p><p>“Any kind of work at the moment is quite a challenge, I have to say,” she says. “On the second week, I really wasn’t in the mood. I was feeling quite flat and a bit down. Then I found myself putting my rollers in, putting my makeup on, choosing the songs, putting my sequins on ... and I felt lifted. Totally lifted.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/21/sophie-ellis-bextor-on-music-motherhood-and-lockdown-discos-most-of-my-children-are-feral">Continue reading...</a>

Each one is like Narnia: from the outside, you would not know of the vast world that lies behind. There are thigh-high buckets full of rice and chapati flour, three-litre jars (four across and four deep) of all the pulses, rice and spices available in the modern world, and a whole shelf dedicated to value kitchen roll.</p><p>In her defence, her family, like many political refugees, have seen real hardship and her bulk-buying comes, in part, from needing to find a smarter way to cook and save, but also from a deep-seated fear, much like we’re all experiencing now, of potentially going hungry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/21/meera-sodhas-vegan-store-cupboard-recipes-for-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I want her to understand the ‘mechanics’, but also to understand that it’s about love and fun. And I don’t want to just give her a book</p><p><strong>As a consequence of the lockdown</strong><strong>, my </strong><strong> 10-year-old daughter, who is in year 6, will now not be getting her </strong><strong>first sex education talk at primary school. I remember mine being excellent. Other parents have been giving their children books, but I am reluctant as many seem to present a “lie back and think of England” approach to sex for women. I’m happy to </strong><strong>discuss things with my daughter (she already </strong><strong>understands periods)</strong><strong>. I really want her to understand the “mechanics” of sex, but to also understand that it is about love </strong><strong>and fun, not just procreating. I </strong><strong>don’t just want to give her a book and tell her to ask questions later. I want her to develop a healthy and fun approach to her sex life as she grows up. I’d really appreciate a little advice on how to start the conversation and make sure she understands on </strong><strong>a scientific and emotional level. </strong><br /></p><p>Don’t fret about this. And don’t feel pressured by knowing she is missing this formal discussion. The timing of such events is, through necessity, planned to accommodate the school calendar rather than an individual student’s readiness to receive such information. You know your daughter best, and intuitively understand how much information is appropriate to share with her at this time or any other – perhaps a lot, and perhaps nothing. Sex educators usually agree that instead of trying to explain everything all at once – which can cause great anxiety and embarrassment for both parent and child – you would be better off creating an atmosphere in which she feels safe and comfortable to ask you questions as they come up. This strategy, combined with using “teachable moments” (times when something she might see on TV or internet sparks a question followed by a calm, naturally timed answer from you), can be the best approach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/21/how-do-i-teach-my-daughter-sex-education-while-under-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Touch is essential to our wellbeing, from the time we are babies. It’s how we transmit meaning, care, love and community. Our sudden loss of it has been agonising</p><p>I am afraid of what I will become without touch. Already the frayed edges are beginning to show. So much of my life and the lives of so many women is found through touch. We touch our babies, we hold them to our breasts and bellies, we wash our ageing mothers’ bodies and comb and braid our daughters’ hair. We massage and we pet and we soothe and we tickle. We do this with each other.</p><p>I have been blessed to feel and embrace and be embraced by women all over the world. To hold their stories and their hands, weep with them in my arms. We know how to do this, women. We know how to express loss and grief with our shuddering bodies and tears, transform our rage into medicine with the simplest caress. We know how the body is filled with microaggressions and macro ones. We know how to loosen ourselves into grieving and tighten ourselves into rage. And many of us are practised in that particular hug that shelters, that relieves, that confirms. Hugging is how we know we are here. How we feel each others’ existence and meaning and value and substance. How we transmit our love, our empathy, our care.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/21/skin-hunger-touch-saved-me-from-unbearable-loneliness-what-will-we-become-without-it">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘Feasting on fantasy’: my month of extreme immersion in Disney+

<p>Disney’s new streaming service arrived in the UK just as the coronavirus lockdown kicked in. With so many hours to fill, it seemed like a sensible investment. Pretty soon, it was infiltrating my every waking hour. By Sophie Elmhirst</p><p>A few weeks ago, on a day that was probably like today now that the days are all frighteningly different and yet strangely the same, Disney launched Disney+, its new streaming service, in the UK. The precise date, for those that are still tracking such things, was 24 March, which was also, by coincidence, the date the British lockdown officially started. I had been waiting, impatiently, for both. One felt frivolous, the other historic – a new thing to watch to add to the endless other things to watch versus the sudden transformation of an entire population’s way of life – and yet here they were entwined, perfectly compatible bedfellows.</p><p>Disney couldn’t have known that the launch of Disney+ would fall upon the same day that 66 million people would be instructed to stay at home for 23 hours a day. They must have set their launch date months ago, long before the first coronavirus case hit Britain, or travellers returned from their fateful half-term Italian skiing holidays, or the prime minister glad-handed his way around a hospital. But to the cynical, it felt like the workings of a darkly prescient marketing strategy. I mean, the timing was <em>ideal</em>. Someone, somewhere in the Disney multiverse must have celebrated – shyly, inappropriately, a quiet elbow bump in a meeting room, perhaps.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/21/disney-plus-streaming-coronavirus-lockdown-feasting-on-fantasy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The World Health Organization has been at the forefront of the global response to new diseases and with differing outcomes. It was hailed for the way it dealt with Sars but pilloried for its handling of Ebola. Now, with its biggest challenge yet, it is in the crosshairs again as Donald Trump threatens to withdraw funding</p><p>When Donald Trump announced he was suspending funding to the World Health Organization it immediately put the future of the UN body in jeopardy. The US president accused the WHO of being too close to China and covering up the spread of Covid-19. But as the journalist <strong>Stephen Buranyi </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana, </strong>the facts do not tally with the Trump’s version of events. In January, the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, declared an emergency and has since been urgently telling 194 of its members to “test, test, test” as the only route out of the crisis. </p><p>As a body with no formal powers to sanction its members, it relies on the effectiveness of its leader. In the past that has led to mixed results: exemplary in the fight against Sars, heavily criticised for its Ebola response. But as the WHO faces its biggest crisis yet, its future is now as uncertain as ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/apr/21/under-attack-who-and-the-coronavirus-pandemic-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
