Animal Crossing: New Horizons offers a seemingly endless amount of possibilities to show off your style thanks to extensive customization options.  This video will break down several of our favorite methods for customizing our island, whether it’s the ground and pathways, or our furniture and house. The first step is to secure the Able Sisters tailor shop on your island, while also making sure that you have the Nintendo mobile app downloaded and connected with your copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Once all the technical steps are out of the way it’s time to customize.

An excellent way to get custom designs is through social media such as Twitter, using hashtags like #ACNHDesigns. Simply enter the creator code at a kiosk located in the Able Sisters shop to gain access to all of that creator’s custom designs, or enter the code for a specific design itself. QR codes can also be scanned via your mobile device in the Nintendo app. If you’re curious what items can have custom designs applied to them, check your Nook Phone in game. The DIY app will show you all the recipes you currently have unlocked and those that are customizable will have a paint brush in the top left hand corner, although not every piece of furniture that is customizable will allow custom designs.

There are a lot of ways to make an island your own, and plenty of online resources that we have linked in the description below. If you want to know more about Animal Crossing, whether that’s how to make some extra money or how to terraform your island, check out our channel for all of our video guides on Animal Crossing: New Horizons!

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is getting more island visitors on April 23 thanks to a new update. Starting that day, Leif the sloth will make periodic visits to your plaza to sell seeds for flowers and shrubs, the latter being new to the game. Redd will also dock his boat at your private beach to sell furniture and art. And yes, that art can be donated to the museum's new art wing.

The game's next named event is Nature Day, which adds special Nook Miles+ objectives for tending to your trees, flowers, and new shrubs. The event runs from April 23 - May 4, as detailed in the video above.

This is one of several upcoming events headed to the game in the near future. May Day, which includes island tours not available via Nook Miles tickets, will overlap with Nature Day by a bit. International Museum Day and Wedding Season will follow after that.
