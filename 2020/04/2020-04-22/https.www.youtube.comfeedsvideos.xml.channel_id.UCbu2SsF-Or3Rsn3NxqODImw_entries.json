Though it's neither a direct sequel to or expansion of XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad takes place after the events of the previous games. After getting our hands on the spin-off, we've discovered that Firaxis has changed plenty about XCOM's traditional formula.\n\nIn the video above, Aaron Sampson goes over six essential tips for succeeding in Chimera Squad. As mentioned before, even if you're a long-time fan of the series, you'll have to consider different mechanics and features if you hope to succeed in Chimera Squad. There's a new breaching phase at the start of every fight, for example, and turn order has been reworked.\n\nChimera Squad encourages you to make additional considerations outside of combat too. As XCOM's permadeath mode doesn't make a return, managing civil unrest becomes a significantly higher priority to preventing a game over. Your squadmates can be injured as well, and you'll have to let them rest or send them off to do some physical therapy training in order to heal.\n\nXCOM: Chimera Squad releases for PC on April 24. The game will launch on sale for $10 USD, though it will return to its original retail price of $20 USD on May 1.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD4RLzei1Js", "date_published": "2020-04-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Giving Fallout 76 Another Shot", "description": "Fallout 76 had a rocky launch, but with the Wastelanders update, you might be tempted to give it another shot.

This video will break down several of our favorite methods for customizing our island, whether it\u2019s the ground and pathways, or our furniture and house. The first step is to secure the Able Sisters tailor shop on your island, while also making sure that you have the Nintendo mobile app downloaded and connected with your copy of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Once all the technical steps are out of the way it\u2019s time to customize.\n\nAn excellent way to get custom designs is through social media such as Twitter, using hashtags like #ACNHDesigns. Simply enter the creator code at a kiosk located in the Able Sisters shop to gain access to all of that creator\u2019s custom designs, or enter the code for a specific design itself. QR codes can also be scanned via your mobile device in the Nintendo app. If you\u2019re curious what items can have custom designs applied to them, check your Nook Phone in game. The DIY app will show you all the recipes you currently have unlocked and those that are customizable will have a paint brush in the top left hand corner, although not every piece of furniture that is customizable will allow custom designs.\n\nThere are a lot of ways to make an island your own, and plenty of online resources that we have linked in the description below.
