This channel recently hit 100 MILLION VIEWS. WHAT!? So we're celebrating with a lightning round video featuring questions submitted by Patreon members.

Hey, you like coffee? Want to support the channel? Today I'm helping out a coffee company here in Dallas called Cultivar Coffee who have been hit hard by the pandemic.

Buy some of their beans here (seriously, I drink this every day, it's awesome):

Or, send me an e-gift card. It'll feed my caffeine habit and help keep them afloat during this rough time:

Thanks everyone!
