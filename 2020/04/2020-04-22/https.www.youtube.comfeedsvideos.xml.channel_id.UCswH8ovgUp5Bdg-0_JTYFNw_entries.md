Settle in its story time! Children’s charity #StarlightUK has had to postpone their Storyteller tour, which sees actors visit hospitals across the country to perform much-loved stories to seriously ill children. But they are still aiming to get these stories out to as many children as possible who may need some comfort and distraction at this time. This evening I will be reading Oscar Wilde’s ‘The Selfish Giant’”
