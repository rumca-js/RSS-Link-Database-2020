The Pop Ups sing the theme song to the wonderful NPR podcast Wow In The World and perform at Wow in the World live shows. In their Tiny Desk (home) concert, they save the earth from an asteroid, explain sound waves through a sing-a-long and a keytar, and encourage us all to invent and create. It's sure to brighten your day.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Synthesizer\"\n\"Meteor\"\n\"Dinosaur Inventors\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ans3p-jnuyo", "date_published": "2020-04-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Nick Hakim: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

He and his four bandmates reset the bar for intimacy at the Desk with their hushed groove. That's why I was so excited to hear what he would do all alone from his home in Bushwick, Brooklyn.\n\nThe Washington, D.C. native played from the corner of his dark bedroom with a keyboard, guitar and stacks of audio components. His recording environment is just what I expected. He performs a three songs from his upcoming album WILL THIS MAKE ME GOOD: a haunting dedication to a fallen friend, \"QADIR,\" the newly released \"CRUMPY\" and the premiere of \"GODS DIRTY WORK.\" He also shows off his peculiar sense of humor, activating a mini applause effect between songs, sipping his beverage right into the microphone and breaking into laughter. While he doesn't engage in much banter, the lyrics in songs like \"GODS DIRTY WORK\" are eerily fitting for this moment we're in.\n\nSET LIST:\n\n\"CRUMPY\"\n\"GODS DIRTY WORK\"\n\"QADIR\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-kMktdfHms", "date_published": "2020-04-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
