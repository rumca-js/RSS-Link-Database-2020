Anyone who writes about apocalypse today is bound to acknowledge that humans have worried and theorised about it for as long as they have worried and theorised about anything; at some point, the writer is guaranteed to employ the word \u201ceschatological\u201d as a nod to the fact that apocalypse is an essential principle of major and minor religions. Yet for a foundational concept it\u2019s quite hard to pin down. Just as \u201creality\u201d is elusive in a once-fragmented world that has (very creatively) reassembled itself online, the apocalypse can apply to whatever you want it to: the Greek root means to uncover or reveal, hence the Book of Revelation, hence the hard truths we learn about humanity\u2019s consequential inaction in every apocalypse story. Marxist revolution can be an apocalypse; relationship experts speak about the \u201cFour Horsemen\u201d of divorce. Apocalypse is a shifting abstraction, a deceptively neat encapsulation of cascading associations and ideas. The End is endlessly debatable, everywhere and nowhere, relative, adaptable, accommodating to many levels of interpretation. As the funny refrain in Bong Joon-ho\u2019s apocalyptic film <em>Parasite</em> goes, it\u2019s \u201cso metaphorical\u201d.</p><p>This is not how many people see it. Along with evangelical Christians, doomsday preppers, and bored Silicon Valley billionaires scheming to colonise Mars or flee to New Zealand, the popular imagination has a pretty intuitive grasp of the apocalypse: it refers to the end of the world, or at least human civilisation. The destruction of everything, or enough of everything that it is impossible to rebuild anything good. According to a <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/03/18/apocalypse-climate-change-pandemic-coronavirus\">YouGov poll</a> conducted in February of this year, 29% of Americans believe an \u201capocalyptic disaster\u201d will occur at some point during their lifetime; given Greta Thunberg\u2019s popularity, it\u2019s fair to say that many more believe one will take place within their children\u2019s lifetimes. (A majority of those polled by YouGov believed they could survive a week or less after apocalyptic disaster, a self-awareness I find heartening.)</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end", "date_published": "2020-04-15 06:30:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "A cancelled holiday cottage ... but why no option for a refund?", "description": "<p>We were told we could rebook the same property but options are limited and prices higher</p><p><strong>I have a break booked this month with <a href=\"https://www.sykescottages.co.uk/\">Sykes Holiday Cottages</a>, which has confirmed that it will not be going ahead.

Since he did not have Netflix to occupy him, Bannatyne whiled away the lockdown hours compiling hundreds of poems \u2013 some of which contained very strong language. A <a href=\"https://www.scotsman.com/health/coronavirus/scotlands-claim-fame-birthplace-f-word-revealed-2529628\">BBC Scotland documentary</a> broadcast last week notes that his poem, <a href=\"https://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780198118886.book.1/actrade-9780198118886-div1-24\">The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie</a>, contains one of the earliest surviving usages of the F-word.
