<p>Gatecrashing bar mitzvahs, quarantine quizzes and climbing Everest indoors – here’s a slew of things to do to stay connected without stepping outside</p><p>Lockdown <em>could</em> have seen us wallowing in some pretty unusual hermetic behaviour. Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.</p><p>Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us <em>more</em> connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent <a href="https://www.channelmum.com/a/the-positive-side-of-coronavirus" rel="nofollow">study</a> by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/apr/15/stuck-at-home-seven-inspiring-tips-to-stay-connected">Continue reading...</a>

## Notes from an Apocalypse by Mark O'Connell review – how to survive the End
 - [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end)

<p>Imagined doom ... an acclaimed writer confronts ideas of the end of civilisation, meets those preparing for it, and manages his anxiety </p><p>The apocalypse needs to end. Anyone who writes about apocalypse today is bound to acknowledge that humans have worried and theorised about it for as long as they have worried and theorised about anything; at some point, the writer is guaranteed to employ the word “eschatological” as a nod to the fact that apocalypse is an essential principle of major and minor religions. Yet for a foundational concept it’s quite hard to pin down. Just as “reality” is elusive in a once-fragmented world that has (very creatively) reassembled itself online, the apocalypse can apply to whatever you want it to: the Greek root means to uncover or reveal, hence the Book of Revelation, hence the hard truths we learn about humanity’s consequential inaction in every apocalypse story. Marxist revolution can be an apocalypse; relationship experts speak about the “Four Horsemen” of divorce. Apocalypse is a shifting abstraction, a deceptively neat encapsulation of cascading associations and ideas. The End is endlessly debatable, everywhere and nowhere, relative, adaptable, accommodating to many levels of interpretation. As the funny refrain in Bong Joon-ho’s apocalyptic film <em>Parasite</em> goes, it’s “so metaphorical”.</p><p>This is not how many people see it. Along with evangelical Christians, doomsday preppers, and bored Silicon Valley billionaires scheming to colonise Mars or flee to New Zealand, the popular imagination has a pretty intuitive grasp of the apocalypse: it refers to the end of the world, or at least human civilisation. The destruction of everything, or enough of everything that it is impossible to rebuild anything good. According to a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2020/03/18/apocalypse-climate-change-pandemic-coronavirus">YouGov poll</a> conducted in February of this year, 29% of Americans believe an “apocalyptic disaster” will occur at some point during their lifetime; given Greta Thunberg’s popularity, it’s fair to say that many more believe one will take place within their children’s lifetimes. (A majority of those polled by YouGov believed they could survive a week or less after apocalyptic disaster, a self-awareness I find heartening.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/15/notes-from-an-apocalypse-by-mark-oconnell-review-how-to-survive-the-end">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Words have always evolved to reflect society.

Since he did not have Netflix to occupy him, Bannatyne whiled away the lockdown hours compiling hundreds of poems – some of which contained very strong language. A <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/health/coronavirus/scotlands-claim-fame-birthplace-f-word-revealed-2529628">BBC Scotland documentary</a> broadcast last week notes that his poem, <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarlyeditions.com/view/10.1093/actrade/9780198118886.book.1/actrade-9780198118886-div1-24">The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie</a>, contains one of the earliest surviving usages of the F-word. (The line in question: “Wan fukkit funling that natour maid ane yrle.”) The earliest known example, for people who give a duck about this sort of thing, is from a court case in 1310 featuring a man called <a href="https://www.medievalists.net/2015/09/the-earliest-use-of-the-f-word-discovered/">Roger Fuckebythenavele</a>. Historians believe this was a nickname.</p><p>The Bannatyne manuscript’s colourful language got me wondering what semantic gems future generations will unearth from our own plague year. After all, Covid-19 has transformed every aspect of our lives, including our lexicon. The expression “social distancing”, for example, has gone from being a relatively unknown piece of academic jargon to something we hear multiple times a day (although the World Health Organization prefers “physical distancing”). Usage of the phrase ‘“flattening the curve” has increased exponentially. The word “super-spreader” has also spread from mouth to mouth at a dizzying rate. “Face mask”, previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/28/the-best-face-masks-beauty-sali-hughes">an indulgence </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/apr/28/the-best-face-masks-beauty-sali-hughes">at a spa day</a>, is now the armour you should wear – here in the US, at least – to buy groceries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/from-covidiot-to-doomscrolling-how-coronavirus-is-changing-our-language">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With numbers plummeting and food hard to find, African penguins face a bleak future – but a novel conservation plan is under way</p><p>It’s amazing to see wild creatures in their natural homes,” says Gaja Rojec, as she sits next to a group of African penguins that don’t seem at all bothered by her presence.

Penguins normally nest on offshore islands, but this small beach is surrounded by houses which form a barrier to land-based predators such as caracal lynxes and baboons, making it a “pseudo island” where the birds feel safe. They have bred here since the early 1980s, and it’s now part of the Table Mountain national park.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/15/decoy-tactics-can-fake-concrete-penguins-help-save-the-real-thing-aoe">Continue reading...</a>

Set in the confines of a shadowy San Francisco tech startup, Amaya, we open as programmer Sergei is offered a position in the company’s secretive development department by founder Forest (Offerman).

Five years on, Amazon Prime has put wind beneath its wings as part of its bid to muscle in on the standup special market. Much improved since its fringe appearance, Savage may still be too self-conscious and self-serious for some comedy fans. “I don’t think there’s enough room in civilised society for sadness anymore,” argues Fraser, whose show is certainly bigger on poignancy than good cheer. The filmed version cuts to audience members who are in tears.</p><p>The show’s ostensible subject is the death of Fraser’s mother, a musician with multiple sclerosis, after decades’ of illness. There are audio clips of Fraser interviewing her mum. But although she warns us at the beginning to expect tragedy, she doesn’t fully address it until the final third. For the most part, her show circles around ideas of faith, carpe diem, and how “only the unfinished can contain the infinite, right?” There are more tenuous ruminations where that comes from, as Fraser tells us how “art is a great way to turn pain into beauty”, and marvels at the innocent pleasures of infancy. “How good was it to be a baby? ... Do you remember how amazing it was?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/apr/15/alice-fraser-savage-review-amazon-prime">Continue reading...</a>
