But what about newcomers? Here's why you should check out FF7 Remake, especially if you're unfamiliar with the series.\n\nFinal Fantasy 7 Remake is a huge event for fans of Square Enix's RPG series and anybody who got lost in the game's world 23 years ago. If you missed the boat back in 1997 or if JRPGs like Final Fantasy aren't your thing, though, you might be wondering what all the fuss is about. FF7's world is a bit confusing to begin with, and that's before you add all the additional caveats that come with the Remake--like the fact that it only covers a fraction of the original FF7 story.\n\nIf you're bewildered by Final Fantasy 7 Remake and all the information swirling around it, the video above is for you. We're laying out why you should care about FF7 Remake, how it relates to the original game, and what's changed. Most importantly, though, is why you should care about FF7 Remake. Given that our review awarded the game one of GameSpot's rare 10 out of 10s, we definitely think you should.\n\nFF7 Remake is a good entry point for the Final Fantasy curious, whether you're new to the franchise or just new to FF7. The original is a classic and the Remake is in a class of its own, but if you never experienced it for yourself, we're here to tell you why.\n\n#FF7Remake #FinalFantasy #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCypPqAL8Gw", "date_published": "2020-04-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Final Fantasy 7 Remake Spoiler And Ending Chat", "description": "Join Jean-Luc, Tamoor, Phil, and Nick as they discuss all things Final Fantasy VII Remake: what they loved, what they didn't like as much, and what the future of the next parts could be.

Revisiting the world of Midgar has turned out to be pretty incredible. At GameSpot, we sat down to talk about the experience of returning to FF7 23 years later and seeing a fresh take on the world.\n\nBut FF7 Remake doesn't just retell the story or add additional context. It makes some changes, too. Our conversations is a spoiler-filled rundown of everything Final Fantasy 7, from the changes to the game's battle system to the liberties it takes with the story--and where those might lead in future installments. We even take some time to discuss how the remake reworks FF7's classic soundtrack into something even more incredible.\n\nAnd of course, we eventually get to the ending of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, where the game makes its biggest diversions from the original. The ending leaves a lot of questions, and we've got some speculation as to what it all means and where it's all going.

Here's everything you need to know about Chimera Squad, from playable aliens to permadeath.\n\nXCOM developer Firaxis announced a new game in the series, and it's coming to PC via Steam very soon. Chimera Squad launches on April 24, and it'll cost you $10 on day one--the price will jump up to $20 on May 1, however.\n\nChimera Squad is a spin-off, not a sequel. It's set five years after the events of XCOM 2 XCOM 2 and changes up the series' gameplay quite a bit. Perhaps most significantly, it removes permadeath: your mission will simply restart if a squad member bleeds out.
