LYRICS

Mondays
Mondays
I’m havin’ a case of the
Mondays
So get out of my hair
Cause I don’t really care
Right now
Mondays
Mondays
Wide-eyed and pillow-faced
Mondays
Why don’t we just stay in bed
Until the sun goes down

Cause my head is full of sand
And day-old wine
And my feet are draggin
Miles and miles behind
And I wonder where we’re going
Do you know?
Does anybody know?
Does anybody know?

Mondays
Mondays
I’m havin’ a case of the
Mondays
Only hours ago we were
All movin’ slow but now
We’re pickin’ up
We’re pickin’ up
The pace
Cause it’s Mondays
Mondays
Wired and tylenoled
Mondays
Gonna answer some mail
And then put the barrel in my mouth
Don’t worry it’s an imaginary gun

I miss the aimless walks
The eggs and toast
No matter what you say
I miss you the most
And I wonder where you’re going
Do you know?
When you get there will you know?
Will you send me a photo?

Instrumental + Ooooos

Mondays
Mondays
I used to know how to skip
Mondays
Just visit the infermerie
Or get a note from mom
But now they’re
Unavoidable
And sometimes
They’re on
Tuesday
And sometimes 
I remember that
Monday
Is a much better day than
Someday
