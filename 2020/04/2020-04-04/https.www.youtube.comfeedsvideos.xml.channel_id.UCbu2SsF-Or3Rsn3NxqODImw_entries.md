## We Teach Antonio To Fish... Forever  - The Vile Villager Episode 2

We play as the biggest jerk in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and in this episode, we figure out how to make Antonio fish for... eternity.

Jake and Rob's quest to be the biggest jerk ever in Animal Crossing: New Horizons continues in the second episode of The Vile Villager. Though the duo get sidetracked in their plans to create a truly ambitious level of mischief, they still manage to succeed in completing some truly terrible shenanigans. 

They have a good reason though. That jerk of a rabbit, Zipper T. Bunny, has come to visit their island with the arrival of the Easter-themed Bunny Day event. Zipper's incessant need to flood the island with eggs has made him more of an annoyance than Rob and Jake--and they can't have that, they can't have that at all. So the big plans need to be put on hold in order to complete the more logical next step: cut down all the cherry blossom trees and ruin Bunny Day for everyone.

Of course, there's other mischief to get up to as well. You'll have to watch the full video to see it all, but rest assured that Jake and Rob manage to once again prove that they're probably the last people you'd ever want to share an island with. I mean, who goes through the process of collecting enough fish and insects to convince Blathers to move his entire operation to some unknown island and then never actually donate the additional specimens that the owl needs to stay in business? 

If you're bored and feel like you're trapped at home, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is an excellent game to pick up and play--especially if you're looking for a co-op experience to share with a non-gamer. In GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review in progress, Kallie Plagge writes, "New Horizons certainly has a slower pace than other Animal Crossing games, partially because you have to work to get things up and running on the island at the start. And while I'm impatient to discover what upgrades might be coming my way (and I need to mess around with Island Designer more), I still feel as though I've done a lot on my island. I've crafted tons of furniture, upgraded my house seven times, picked thousands of weeds, and done far too many drastic outfit changes. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am to decorate my island and make it my own, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future."

## Resident Evil 3 Remake's Best Mode Is Hidden

Resident Evil 3 Remake's campaign shows off some daring and intense moments throughout Jill Valentine's attempts to escape Raccoon City. In addition to fighting numerous undead and other bio-weapons, the protagonist will face off against the game's main villain, Nemesis, at key points throughout the game. While the campaign doesn't always follow through with its attempts to balance survival horror and action, it still makes for an enjoyable game to play. However, Resident Evil 3 Remake has an unlockable difficulty setting that not only pushes it closer to its survival horror roots, but it also offers some of the game's most intense encounters.

In this video, we explain why the Nightmare mode in RE3 Remake is a fantastic addition to the game. Unlocked after finishing the Hardcore mode, Nightmare adds more enemies and reshuffles key item locations. The key villain, Nemesis, also sees an upgrade, and it'll be move faster and be more aggressive in its attempts to take you out. But what makes the bonus mode so engaging is how it remixes many of the game's encounters with the enemies to focus more on the tension found in traditional survival horror games--the feeling of uncertainty of what's around the corner. Even if you're well-acquainted with the game after a single playthrough, Nightmare mode adds in some chilling surprises, which will likely lead to an unexpected end. 

Resident Evil 3 is out now on PC, PS4, and Xbox One.

## Resident Evil 3 Remake: 14 Easter Eggs and References

Here's our list of Resident Evil 3 easter eggs and references that call back to the original 1999 title as well as 2018's Resident Evil 2 Remake.

Resident Evil 3, a remake of 1999's Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, is officially out. The remake has plenty of Easter eggs and hidden references--in fact, we've managed to find over a dozen so far.

In the video above, Richie Bracamonte details 14 times that Resident Evil 3 references the original game or the other titles in the survival horror franchise. Don't worry, this video is relatively spoiler-free. Though it does showcase some of the locations you'll visit later in the single-player campaign, it doesn't talk about major storybeats. 

Some of RE3's Easter eggs are fairly obvious--like protagonist Jill's outfit from the original game, which you can unlock--while others are a bit trickier to find or easy to miss. Did you know, for example, that when you visit locations from Resident Evil 2, the codes you used to unlock lockers and doors from RE2 will still work in RE3? It makes sense, of course. They are literally the same lockers and doors.

In GameSpot's Resident Evil 3 review, Alessandro Fillari wrote, "Even without taking into account the original game, or its predecessor, RE3 struggles to keep up with its pace amid a clashing of elements from survival horror and standard action. While it has a strong start and gives its principal villain some great moments, this truncated retelling of the concluding game from the original Resident Evil trilogy doesn't do it proper justice." 

That said, Alessandro does enjoy playing the remake on Nightmare mode--which transforms the fairly linear game into something closer to the terrifying survival horror experience of its predecessor. It's the best way to play Resident Evil 3.

The new version of Atlus' celebrated RPG, Persona 5 Royal, is out now on PlayStation 4. It's not quite the same game you remember, however, as Royal includes a number of significant differences compared to the original release. This includes updated story and combat mechanics, and lots more.
In a new video, Jess covers over a dozen of the biggest new changes in Persona 5 Royal. Most obvious are the new characters and the additional semester that comes at the conclusion of the original game. The new characters are Kasumi and Marui, and there is a new location, too: Kichijoji. This region includes a lot of new stores, including shops where you can sell sooty clothing for money and points, and a dart and billiards parlor called Penguin Sniper.

Check out the full video above to learn lots more about what's new in Persona 5 Royal. Bear in mind, however, that this is just the beginning for the differences you can find in the game. Whatever the case, we can say that the time investment (Persona 5 Royal can be a 150-hour game) is absolutely worth it to see and experience all that's new.

Jean-Luc takes Potato Mode to the next level by turning the graphics of Half-Life: Alyx into mush and then experiencing them up close and personal in VR.

Here on Potato Mode, we take our favorite games and turn their graphics into absolute mush for your enjoyment. This week, we kick it up a notch by stepping into the world of VR with Half-Life: Alyx.

Alyx is without a doubt one of the most impressive-looking VR games to date, and returning to City 17 after all these years is a real treat, which makes it all the more hilarious when we completely ruin its graphics. It's a real trip in particular for Jean-Luc who is experiencing the whole thing up close in virtual reality. Thankfully it didn't make him sick!

If you're curious about Half-Life: Alyx, you can check out our video where we tested the game on the four biggest VR headsets. Or watch Michael Higham's review, where he gave the game a 9/10, saying, "Not only has Half-Life: Alyx made good on its shift to VR, it has elevated many of the aspects we've come to love about Half-Life games."
