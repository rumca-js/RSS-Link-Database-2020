What was Gollum doing when he was known as Sméagol? Who were the Stoor Hobbits that he belonged to?  In this video, I track Gollum’s deeds from the time he is born in the Gladden Fields, acquiring The One Ring, his exile to the Misty Mountains, meeting Bilbo, and his search far and wide to find The Ring until he meets Frodo and Sam in the Emyn Muil in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers.
