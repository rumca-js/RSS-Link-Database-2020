<p>Head of New Zealand’s opposition National party says: ‘I don’t think anyone has a monopoly on compassion’ as he gears up for September election</p><p>Whatever plans Simon Bridges had to convince New Zealanders that he should be their next prime minister are – nominally at least – on hold. Bridges, the leader of the parliamentary opposition and of the centre-right National party, suspended campaigning for September’s poll last month as lawmakers across the political spectrum united to endorse a four-week shutdown over the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>But despite the cross-party display of support for measures to combat the virus’ spread, politics for Bridges is never far away. A post on his Facebook page is soliciting support for his call to quarantine everyone entering New Zealand – currently, the government is allowing some to self-isolate at home – and urges the public to message him directly with their problems or complaints during the lockdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/simon-bridges-the-former-prosecutor-who-faces-his-greatest-trial-against-nice-person-ardern">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest series from Julian Fellowes starts badly and barely improves but it is a reminder football has never stood still</p><p>You can see how <em>The English Game</em> must have sounded in conception. It’s the birth of football. It’s toffs against proles, the rivalry of one of the great aristocrats of the early game, Lord Arthur Kinnaird, and the Glaswegian stonemason who was the first great professional, Fergus Suter. It’s about an idea going out into the world and being profoundly changed when it is taken up by the masses.</p><p>But Netflix’s new series comes nowhere near what it might have been, and is little more than a mishmash of <em>Downton Abbey</em> stereotypes and trouble-at-mill cliches. The toffs are habitually awful, the banks are always foreclosing, and the proles, salt-of-the-earth brawlers and charmers that they are, can’t help themselves but get everybody unhelpfully pregnant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/04/the-english-game-netflix">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The award-winning author on her favourite dystopian fiction, why she’d like to meet Alice Munro, and her eerie new novel set during the 2008 financial crash</p><p><a href="http://www.emilymandel.com/">Emily St John Mandel</a> is a Canadian novelist now residing in New York. Her fourth novel, the<em> </em> dystopian fiction of <em>Station Eleven</em>, propelled her to fame in 2014. It was a bestseller in both the UK and the US, winning the Arthur C Clarke award for science fiction, and nominations for the National Book Award and the Pen/Faulkner award. Her new novel is <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-glass-hotel-9781509882809.html">The Glass Hotel</a></em>.</p><p><em><strong>The </strong></em><em><strong>Glass Hotel</strong></em><strong> centres on </strong><strong> </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>2008</strong><strong> financial crash. Why was that a period you wanted to explore?<br /></strong>It’s a period in recent history that I remember so vividly. It was such an unsettling, chaotic time. In particular, I was fascinated by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/bernard-madoff">Bernie Madoff</a> story. <em>The Glass Hotel</em> is not about Bernie Madoff or his staff, his family or his investors. But it is the same crime in the novel. Madoff almost seemed like the embodiment of that era. There was such popular rage directed against him because we thought our economies were solid and it turned out to be something of a house of cards. And here was this fabulously wealthy conman who’d been gambling with retirement savings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/04/emily-st-john-mandel-i-admire-novelists-who-are-pushing-the-form-forward-in-some-some">Continue reading...</a>

Three large landowners have confirmed that their tenants are no longer allowed to burn heather routinely.</p><p>The ban is a blow to grouse shoots, which burn older heather to make way for younger, more nutritious plants for grouse to feed on, but environmental groups say the practice harms the environment. <a href="https://water.leeds.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2017/06/EMBER_full-report.pdf">Research by the University of Leeds</a> has found that burning grouse moors degrades peatland habitat, releases climate-altering gases, reduces biodiversity and increases flood risk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/grouse-shoots-scrapped-as-heather-burning-is-banned-on-moors">Continue reading...</a>

It had been sent to Viv Richards and was the confirmation of his salary for the forthcoming season. At the bottom was Viv’s signature. The sum agreed was just under £9,000 for a six‑month contract. That equates to a salary of £31,000 today.</p><p>At the time Richards was the best batsman in the world, just as Brian Lara – arguably – was in 1994 when Warwickshire paid him £40,000 for a season, which now equates to about £68,000.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/04/england-cricketers-willing-to-dig-deep-but-county-game-will-be-hit-hard">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For locked-down home schoolers, a game featuring its very own gallery of dinosaurs, insects and fish holds an irresistible allure </p><p>In common with many other parents during the recent collapse of the British educational system, I find myself unexpectedly plunged into the challenges of home-schooling. And while, in theory, one might admire the impulse to pass on one’s knowledge to one’s children, the practice is quite another thing (maths in particular appears to have changed beyond recognition since my own school days). </p><p>And then there’s quarantine itself. Erstwhile home-schoolers could leave the house for educational trips to the countryside or a city museum. No such luxury now. Some relief is at hand, however, in <em><a href="https://animal-crossing.com/">Animal Crossing</a></em>, a game I first mentioned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/21/plague-inc-pandemic-gaming-coronavirus-animal-crossing-horizon">a couple of weeks ago</a>. In Japan, the latest entry in the life-simulation series in which players emigrate to a sunny island to start a bucolic life in a community of anthropomorphic animals has become the bestselling video game for the Switch, a console that was already home to numerous multimillion-sellers. For those on lockdown, the fantasy of escaping to a reality in which shops are open and fraternising with one’s neighbours is encouraged has been irresistibly alluring.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/04/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-perfect-for-home-schoolers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our political correspondent on the bombshell briefing that changed the mood across the country</p><p>I was in the midst of the usual reporter’s juggle, trying to write on a notepad balanced on one thigh while resting a dictation machine on the other, when the prime minister’s tone suddenly changed, prompting me to look up. Standing in front of me at the lectern in Downing Street, Boris Johnson said: “I must level with you...”. What was coming next could only be bad news: these aren’t words typically used by a prime minister who trades in bluster, bluff and optimism.</p><p>He continued: “More families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.” It was a chilling remark and that was the moment everything changed in terms of reporters’ understanding of the crisis’s severity and unprecedented scale. You could hear a pin drop as we listened to the rest of Johnson’s address. Just inside Downing Street’s side door, where we retrieved belongings such as phones and laptopsthat are not allowed in the main building, we hurriedly rang newsdesks to double-check they had heard Johnson’s startling words for themselves. The next day I travelled to Northumberland to see my parents, who are in their 60s, and asked them to take the advice very seriously.

<p>Our lives have changed radically but we can adapt, says a former Guardian journalist who has lived solo on a boat for three years – and learned to love it<br /><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/04/i-cultivated-a-joy-in-little-things-coping-with-isolation-in-the-wild">Living alone in the wild</a></strong></p><p>‘I want to reassure people,” I announced grandly on Instagram the other day, “that it’s easier to change behaviour than you think.” With anxious friends facing a massive change of life in the face of coronavirus, I wanted to spread some calm.</p><p>The reason I’d started dispensing “wisdom” like some nautical soothsayer was that I gave up a much-loved job at the Guardian three years ago to pursue a simpler life on my tiny sailboat. I ended up crossing the Channel to France, sailing down the Atlantic coast to Portugal, into the Mediterranean, through Spain and Italy to Greece. It’s the slowest life imaginable, travelling at walking pace, completely immersed in nature. I sleep freely in secluded bays, by white beaches, fish and octopus swimming below me. I’ve sailed with dolphins and whales, woken to horses galloping on deserted beaches in southern Italy, and anchored by castles and cathedral-like cliffs. It is magical and it is nourishing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/04/i-live-alone-on-a-boat-at-sea-how-to-be-happy-in-isolation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A growing micro-tannery sector in the UK is helping to create value for thousands of male goats that would otherwise be killed at birth<br /></p><p>Jack Millington walks past two huge industrial-style wooden tanning drums, through a door into the well-insulated drying room. Here, at 35C, amid the whirring of the dehumidifier and one small electric heater, hides from billy goats are stretched out on racks to dry.</p><p>Strong yet silky soft to touch, the beauty of the hides lies in the details – from the natural texture of the grain to the spine marks visible down the centre of each pale brown goatskin. <br /><br />“Every hide is different – these patterns are almost like a fingerprint and that’s exciting to see for the first time as they dry,” says Millington, 31.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/circular-economy-the-tannery-making-leather-from-billy-goats">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The waste washing up on British beaches is a shocking but fascinating catalogue of our times</p><p>Tracey Williams has been a beachcomber for most of her life. It started with school holidays to north Cornwall in the 1960s, searching for shells, sea glass and <a href="https://marinedimensions.ie/what-is-a-mermaid-purse/" title="">mermaids’ purses</a> among the rocks and sand. In the 1980s, after her parents moved to a 300-year-old clifftop house in Bigbury-on-Sea, in south Devon, Williams and her father would seek out fossils in their back garden and down by the shore.</p><p>“But I’d also find old bottles, figurines, medieval rings, and bring them in, clean them up,” she says. “You know, chance finds.” Then, 23 years ago, everything changed. “I started finding Lego pieces washed up on the shore,” she explains. “Flippers, scuba tanks, the occasional dragon or octopus. By that time I had two young children, and we could take buckets down to the beach and just fill them with the amount of Lego coming in.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/04/monopoly-houses-toy-soldiers-lego-museum-of-plastic-lost-at-sea">Continue reading...</a>

## Are mortgage payment holidays really a good idea? | Patrick Collinson

<p>Most banks will offer a break during the coronavirus crisis, but it doesn’t suit everyone</p><p>About 1 million mortgage holders have applied for a payment holiday in the past fortnight, according to industry sources. Should you do so, too?</p><p><strong>1. It’s not free money. But it’s very cheap. </strong>Let’s be clear that you still have to pay for your holiday, the banks are not just writing off the money. They add whatever you didn’t pay to your total mortgage, and when the three months is up your repayments go up. But with interest rates so low, it makes surprisingly little difference. For example, using <a href="https://moneyed.co.uk/calculators/mortgage_holiday">Moneyed.co.uk’s mortgage calculator</a>, a £200,000 mortgage taken out in May 2018 at a 2.5% rate costs £897 a month. If you take the three-month holiday, afterwards the cost will rise to £910 a month. “If the choice is between really struggling or taking the mortgage holiday, then the additional cost further down the line is actually quite small beer,” says broker Ray Boulger of John Charcol.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/04/mortgage-payment-holiday-banks-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>
