They sang songs from their collaborative record Love Letters For Fire. This time around, Jesca Hoop came to the Tiny Desk with just her guitars, her lovely voice, and brilliant poetic songs. She has a magical way with words, and she opened her set with \"Pegasi,\" a beautiful song about the wild ride that is love, from her 2017 album Memories Are Now.\n\nThe two songs that follow are from her latest album, Stonechild, the album that captured my heart in 2019, and the reason I reached out to invite her to perform at my desk. \"All Time Low\" is a song, she says, for the \"existential underdog.\"\n\n\"Michael on the outside, always looking in\nA dog in the fight but his dog never wins\nIf he works that much harder, his ship might come in\nHe gives it the old heave-ho.\"\n\nAnd for her final tune, she plays my favorite song from Stonechild, \"Shoulder Charge.\" It's a song that features a word that Jesca stumbled upon online: \"sonder,\" which you won't find in the dictionary. She tells the NPR crowd \"sonder\" is the realization \"that every person that you come across is living a life as rich and complex as your own.\" And that realization takes you out of the center of things, something that is at the heart of \"Shoulder Charge\" and quite a potent moment in this deeply reflective and personal Tiny Desk concert.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Pegasi\"\n\"All Time Low\"\n\"Shoulder Charge\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJesca Hoop: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Bob Boilen, Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, Alex Drewenskus; Videographers: Maia Stern, Melany Rochester; Editor: Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Production Assistant: Shanti Hands; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Kisha Ravi/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahqSpH38xPo", "date_published": "2020-04-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Black Thought of The Roots: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

In this installment of Tiny Desk (home) Concerts, hip-hop wordsmith Tariq Trotter, aka Black Thought of The Roots crew, took the occasion to premiere three new songs.\n\nOn \"Thought Vs. Everybody,\" Thought calls for unity in response to the conditions of an encroaching dystopia. Next up is \"Yellow,\" a song from his upcoming off-Broadway musical Black No More, an adaption of the 1931 Afrofuturist novel by George S. Schuyler, set during the Harlem Renaissance. The track is co-written with Anthony Tidd. He closes with \"Nature of the Beast,\" a cross-genre collaboration with alternative music sweethearts Portugal. The Man, who pop up on screen from a remote location. \"Thought Vs. Everybody\" and \"Nature of the Beast\" are produced by Sean C and will appear on Streams of Thought Vol. 3, which will be released as an EP.\n\nSET LIST\n\nThought Vs.
