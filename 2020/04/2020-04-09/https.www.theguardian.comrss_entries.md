<p>This feature-length space odyssey sees the gang reunite to fight a bunch of evil felines, in an adventure that’s great fun for fans and perfectly watchable for everyone else</p><p>As what is familiar continues to crumble around us, it makes sense that people are turning to familiar comforts. There is so much bread-baking and pub-quizzing going on that it’s as if we’ve all briefly stepped into a 1970s sitcom, though I have to say, the punchlines could do with polishing up. The return of Red Dwarf (Dave) is a bracing reminder that the sci-fi comedy has been going for 32 years, with a few lengthy gaps.</p><p>This is a perfect time, then, for Red Dwarf to both return and to try something new, airing its first ever feature-length episode of the show, The Promised Land. Over 3m years, the cat smuggled on board Red Dwarf by Lister has evolved into the cat-human hybrid species to which Cat belongs, only they are not all as friendly in their preening ways as he is. Here, an army of megalomaniac cats try to assert their supremacy by smashing a religion based on a figure known as the Holy Poppadom (or Cloister) who is, of course, our familiar slob-in-residence, Dave Lister.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/09/red-dwarf-the-promised-land-review-megalomaniac-cats-are-out-for-revenge">Continue reading...</a>

We advocated that the Bank defy conventional Treasury wisdom to deal with coming crises of the modern age by funding any required government stimulus. This paper can claim no special foresight of the coronavirus pandemic, but it is encouraging that Mr Bailey has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending" title="">largely taken our advice</a>.</p><p>What the governor’s action reveals is that one arm of government, the central bank, is funding another, the Treasury. This is not novel. Monetary financing is functionally equivalent to issuing bonds and then buying them back using quantitative easing. The only difference is that the bank owns the balance rather than the bonds. Yet the rubicon has been crossed, again. The governor <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/e7fa6ac4-c2a0-4c6c-b1e1-17ab91316915" title="">would not say so</a> – because this is not what respectable central bankers admit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-19-fight-it-can-be-paid-for">Continue reading...</a>

Like many comforting predictions in the early days of this pandemic, that is beginning to look alarmingly over-confident.</p><p>The first problem with picking up exactly where we left off is that where we left off was already in trouble. Today’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/uk-economy-already-flatlining-before-coronavirus-figures-reveal">GDP figures</a>, covering the three-month period to February when the coronavirus had started to nibble at the travel and tourism industry but we were weeks away from lockdown, show economic growth virtually flatlining at 0.1% overall and falling in the final four weeks. Far from enjoying some mythical “Boris bounce”, we may have been teetering on the verge of a recession, as business confidence dried up in the face of a potentially hard Brexit. The fear is that the economic aftermath of this crisis, like the virus itself, might be toughest on those with pre-existing conditions - including otherwise thriving western countries choosing this moment in history to shoot themselves in the foot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/brexit-britain-economy-coronavirus-gdp-figures-economic-growth">Continue reading...</a>

On 18<sup> </sup>March, he and two kitchen porters were sent a letter from their bosses announcing “some extremely difficult decisions” had to be made that meant their positions had “been made redundant”.

Rather than being paid for their outstanding holiday, the workers have been ordered to use it up during their notice period: a straightforward violation of the law.

<p>Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are </p><p>As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.</p><p>Urinary incontinence usually affects women (up to 45% of us) after childbirth, or during the menopause. Other factors include obesity, bladder surgery, hysterectomy or neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease or multiple sclerosis. It’s not just older people affected, either – even athletes are prone to incontinence. A Scandinavian study states that up to 80% of professional female trampolinists experience leakage. Men who have undergone surgery to treat prostate cancer can suffer, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-taboo/2020/apr/09/dont-let-a-weak-bladder-stop-you-doing-the-things-you-love">Continue reading...</a>

It was 2001 and the guitarist and “band mum” had tamed egos, anchored stressful tours and clung tight as his bandmates swerved into electronic music. Now, the five-piece had nothing to prove, and he had slipped underwater. “I took St John’s Wort, a herbal antidepressant,” he recalls. “It scared the fuck out of me. It numbed me.”</p><p>O’Brien, now 51, was numb to everything back then, except for chronic back pain – a cruel irony for the child from a family of osteopaths. To recuperate, he and his girlfriend flew to Brazil, where they met a pair of friends. An encounter with a healer, they told him, may have saved their lives.

The 29-year-old has had 134 professional fights and lost 123 of them. His record may look damning but in fact it highlights his durability as a journeyman, a crucial cast member in the opening acts of the most brutal of sports.</p><p>“I used to work as a barber and I was asked what is a journeyman all the time by my customers,” says Van Poetsch. “Basically, my role is to go in, put on a good show and initiate a new prospect into boxing. I know what I’m doing in there – when to go hard and when to just go the distance. People think it’s like something out of Snatch, going down for fixes in the fifth round, but it’s not like that. We play a vital role at the start of a prospect’s career.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/behind-the-lines/2020/apr/09/life-journeyman-boxer-fights-defeats-few-pints-boxing-lewis-van-poetsch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Cultural knowledge, passed from animal to animal, is key to how species adapt to change in the world around them</p><p>Sam Williams’ <a href="http://macawrecoverynetwork.org/">Macaw Recovery Network</a> in Costa Rica rewilds captivity-hatched fledgling scarlet and great green macaws. But introducing young birds into a complex forest world – bereft of the cultural education normally provided by parents – is slow and risky.</p><p>For 30 years or so scientists have referred to the diversity of life on Earth as “biological diversity”, or just “biodiversity”. They usually define biodiversity as operating at three levels: the diversity of genes within any particular species; the diversity of species in a given place; and the diversity of habitat types such as forests, coral reefs, and so on. But does that cover it? Not really. A fourth level has been almost entirely overlooked: cultural diversity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/09/the-secret-call-of-the-wild-how-animals-teach-each-other-to-survive-aoe">Continue reading...</a>
