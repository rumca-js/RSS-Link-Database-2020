However, for one group of animals, there may be a silver lining. Pangolins are one of the most heavily trafficked animals in the world, and as a result they are endangered. But in the past few weeks they have been linked to the initial outbreak of the Covid-19 disease in China. The evidence is inconclusive, but it has already prompted the Chinese government to take action. If more actions against the wildlife trade follow, the incident could prove to be a turning point for pangolin conservation.</p><p>A key question is where Covid-19 came from. Many animals carry coronaviruses and are potential sources of infection. That is important to know, if only because it should help us prevent future outbreaks. Several ideas have been proposed, but arguably the most dramatic is that pangolins were the source.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/18/covid-19-a-blessing-for-pangolins">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US author on writing about intimacy, the place for pretentiousness in art and surviving lockdown</p><p>Garth Greenwell’s second book, <em>Cleanness</em>, seems to flow directly from his sumptuous, sensuous debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/02/what-belongs-to-you-garth-greenwell-review">What Belongs to You</a></em>. Like its predecessor, the new work concerns an unnamed American teacher working in Sofia who falls in love with a man who brings him both great pleasure and pain. The book is structured as nine interlinked stories, centred around the narrator’s affair with a man known only as R. The stories are not arranged chronologically but, rather, radiate out from the three middle chapters, which focus most directly on R. Greenwell is in Iowa City when we speak on the telephone – he is a visiting lecturer at the renowned Writers’ Workshop there.<br /></p><p><strong>Do you think of this book as a novel or a collection of short stories?<br /></strong>None of the available labels feels to me suitable to the book. I’m very happy for people to talk about it in whatever way seems most helpful to them. My first education in art was as a classical singer and my first experience of how pieces can be turned into wholes in art was singing lieder cycles. The closest model to the book in my mind is Schubert’s <em>Winterreise</em>. There’s a way in which I hope the nine chapters are like spheres of intensity that are placed in a relationship that is not the consequence of plot or the linearity of chronology, but is instead a kind of constellation, that there are charged relationships between them that is like a key change, or a mood, or an echo, or a motif. That may sound pretentious, but I think there’s a place for pretentiousness in art.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/18/garth-greenwell-sex-is-an-extraordinary-subject-for-a-writer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joanna Trollope is wrong to turn housework into some kind of battle between the sexes</p><p>Anybody felt deeply fulfilled while cleaning the lavatory lately? No, me neither.</p><p>Novelist Joanna Trollope (author of Aga sagas) has been talking about women and domesticity. According to her, while women are now in the workplace, they also try to dominate the domain because they’re “emotionally ambitious”. They want to make men dependent, then resent men for it. “You [women] can’t have it every which way,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/02/joanna-trollope-on-families-fiction-and-feminism-society-still-expects-women-to-do-all-the-caring">says Trollope</a>. “It’s classic passive aggressive behaviour.” She says women want to control the domestic arena “because it’s a manageable control”. “When you’ve had your heart broken, almost the best thing you can do is clean the bathroom – because tap polishing is one of the things you can control.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/18/me-a-domestic-goddess-no-i-just-like-a-clean-house">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Democratic governors can’t rely on the president to protect citizens and Republican governors must act as lackeys of a monarch</p><p>Many American institutions and traditions have been challenged in the era of Donald Trump. The latest is federalism, the idea that power should be shared between the federal government and the states. The president’s response to the coronavirus epidemic has had a curious impact, overturning the historical preferences of both parties. Put simply, coronavirus has meant federalism for Democrats who have been abandoned in the face of the pandemic, and slavish devotion to federal authority for Republicans.</p><p>Federalism provides a logical way for the United States to respond to epidemics. States have the primary responsibility for their citizens’ health – about which they have the best information – but the federal government needs to take the lead in coordinating a national response. Supplies need to be sent where they are needed most, and measures like lockdowns have to be implemented and lifted in accordance with a national plan rather than haphazardly at the state level – because, as Andrew Cuomo <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trump-has-single-handedly-created-a-new-federalism">has said</a>, “state boundaries mean very little to the virus”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/18/federalism-another-casualty-donald-trump-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mrs America gives Phyllis Schlafly a depth in fiction that was lacking in history but Shirley Chisholm is refreshingly portrayed as more than just a martyr</p><p>The real hero of Mrs America, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/15/mrs-america-cate-blanchett-fx-hulu">new FX miniseries</a> chronicling the early 1970s political battle over the Equal Rights Amendment, is Phyllis Schlafly. Schlafly, the conservative movement leader who led the antifeminist backlash against the amendment, styled herself a housewife and mother of six, but really she was an educated, driven and ambitious professional political operator, skilled in forging alliances among unlikely counterparts and manipulating the motivations of others toward her own ends.</p><p>In the miniseries, a slick, beautifully shot portrait of 1970s America, she is played by Cate Blanchett, who masterfully shows Schlafly finding an outlet for her own frustrated political ambitions in the anti-ERA fight, and rising from a minor conservative commentator on the lunatic fringe to the primary voice of social conservatism on the national stage. As the ERA is defeated – going from a bipartisan shoo-in that sailed through the Senate to an embattled, controversial document that meets resistance in every statehouse – the show encourages us to see the downfall of the major political effort of the second wave feminist movement as the result, paradoxically, of one woman’s phenomenal personal determination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/18/what-mrs-america-gets-right-and-what-it-gets-wrong-about-70s-feminism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>PDC’s commendable new idea, in which stars of the game play from their own homes, is undone by nonexistent production values, shonky wifi and a total absence of atmosphere</p><p>Threw the Keyhole. One of several tricks missed by the Professional Darts Corporation as it brought competitive sport to the bored masses on Friday night, the failure to name its new tournament in homage to the game show that invites viewers to snoop around the houses of unidentified celebrities seemed a comparatively minor oversight by the end of an opening evening that featured more missed notes than doubles.</p><p>On the face of it, Darts at Home is a terrific idea. With sports fans already tired of watching bored footballers juggling toilet roll on social media, the PDC hit upon the wheeze of staging a competition with upwards of 130 of the world’s elite tungsten titans facing each other from the sanctuary of their own houses. To paraphrase the former oche announcer Martin Fitzmaurice: “Lets … play … socially … responsible … darts!”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/18/oche-computer-darts-at-home-shows-vital-importance-of-bells-and-whistles">Continue reading...</a>

Will it change this year’s election?</p><p>Death was the catalyst for Walter “Hawk” Newsome’s most contentious idea. It came to him during the first few days of July in 2016. This was the week that a Minnesota police officer shot 32-year-old Philando Castile <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/20/philando-castile-shooting-marijuana-car-dashcam-footage">five times</a> and killed him in his car; an off-duty New York police officer <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/off-duty-shoots-man-dead-road-rage-incident-brooklyn-article-1.2698074">killed</a> 37-year-old Delron Dempsey in front of his family; and two Louisiana cops fatally shot Alton Sterling <a href="https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/coroner-releases-autopsy-toxicology-reports-for-alton-sterling/289-532514020">six times</a>.</p><p>These extrajudicial slayings bedeviled Newsome, who spent his youth being terrorized by the NYPD in the Bronx. Despite the Democratic politicians he had canvassed and campaigned for – from Bloomberg before his “stop and frisk” days to Barack Obama – the situation didn’t seem to get better. Blacks were still being killed by the police at a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/">disproportionate rate</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/i-aint-voting-till-black-lives-matter-what-does-an-activists-radical-strategy-mean-for-2020">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How to make firelighters, combat squirrels and conduct a rubber chicken choir … the author shares practical tips from lockdown in Canada</p><p>As the first world war dragged on, volunteer women’s groups of all kinds formed in aid of the troops in the trenches: bandage rolling, preserved foods box packing, knitting. My grandmother joined a knitting group in rural Nova Scotia. You started on washcloths, progressed to scarves; then, if you were sufficiently adroit, you moved on to balaclavas and socks, and ultimately – the pinnacle! – to gloves. My grandmother was a terrible knitter. She never got beyond washcloths.</p><p>I’ve often wondered about these knitting groups. What were they for, really? Were they providing much-needed knitted items, or were they boosting morale by giving a bunch of otherwise very anxious civilians, whose sons and husbands were in jeopardy, something to do with their hands while waiting, waiting, endlessly waiting? I can see the socks and gloves making it to the frontlines, but the washcloths? Photographs of muddy, cramped, stinky trench life don’t show much washing going on. And my grandmother’s wonky, hole-filled washcloths in particular – were they sent to a secret depot where they were unraveled, and their wool reclaimed for something more functional?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/18/margaret-atwoods-lockdown-diary-life-as-an-eccentric-self-isolationist">Continue reading...</a>

## Five fishermen, a stormy night and £53m of cocaine: were the Freshwater Five wrongly convicted?

<p>A decade ago, the fishermen were sentenced to a total of 104 years in prison. Now, new evidence suggests they are innocent</p><p>The first arrests took place on the harbour at Yarmouth, the cobbled, picture-book port that lies on the Isle of Wight’s quieter western side. It was a Sunday evening, 30 May 2010, almost a decade ago, but Nicky Green still sees it in Technicolor. She was working in Salty’s, the family’s restaurant just yards from the marina. “It was the bank holiday weekend and we were absolutely stacked,” she says. Her parents were serving behind the bar, her daughter was waiting tables and her younger brother, Jamie, a 42-year-old fisherman, was out on the quay, just back from sea. “I’d called and asked him to bring in some lobsters,” Nicky recalls. “I was expecting him to walk through the door when someone told me he’d been arrested.”</p><p>In the moment, she was too busy to follow it up. “I was juggling the food, the crowds, the tables, and I knew Jamie was having an issue with some other fishermen – they were accusing each other of pinching lobster pots, and he was dodging the CID guy trying to deal with it. I thought this was fishermen bickering. I never on this Earth thought it was serious. How would I have ever imagined the gravity?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/18/five-fishermen-a-stormy-night-and-53m-of-cocaine-were-the-freshwater-five-wrongly-convicted">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sixty birds shot at England training facility in St George’s Park, Staffordshire, despite pledge to enrich local biodiversity</p><p>About 60 greylag geese were shot and killed at the national training centre for England football teams from 2018 to 2019 to “preserve safety” because they were defecating on the pitches.</p><p>The Football Association said the birds – which it shot after obtaining a licence to kill – also left large amounts of excrement in public areas, and this not only heightened the risk of people slipping over but also raised the possibility of harmful parasites spreading.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/18/revealed-fa-had-geese-killed-at-national-centre-to-protect-its-pitches">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We were planning a new life together. Now our only contact is a snatched phone call during his daily run</p><p>It’s 5.41pm, and I am worried. My boyfriend usually calls me on the dot of 5.30, and during these unusual times, I crave this daily check-in. The thing is, I can’t call him. Leo is married and in lockdown with his wife and two children. It was hard enough being a mistress (a terrible 17th-century word, but nothing else quite fits) in “peace time”, but Covid-19 has given our relationship a whole new dimension.</p><p>Leo and I are both writers. We met at a literary festival last June. I am 51, a newly divorced Londoner, with a daughter at university. Leo is 49 and lives near Manchester. I knew from the outset that he was married: he wasn’t wearing a ring, but one of our first conversations was about family holidays. I wouldn’t say it was love at first sight, but he was funny and clever. Nice-looking, yes, but it was more his personality that attracted me; he radiated humorous warmth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/18/im-involved-with-a-married-man-will-our-affair-survive-the-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>
