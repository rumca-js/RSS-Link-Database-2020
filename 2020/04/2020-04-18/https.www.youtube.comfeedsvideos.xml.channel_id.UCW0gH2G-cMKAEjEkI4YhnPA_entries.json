Today, we cover brothers Balin and Dwalin from Balin's birth prior to Smaug's attack on Erebor to Dwalin's potential participation in the Battle of Dale and Balin's expedition to Moria.  My hope is that this series will help enrich our enjoyment of these characters in The Hobbit Trilogy.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings! \n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
