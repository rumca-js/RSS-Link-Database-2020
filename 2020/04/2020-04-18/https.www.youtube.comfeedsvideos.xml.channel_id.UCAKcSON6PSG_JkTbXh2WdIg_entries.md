Throughout her set in The Current studio, Sudan Archives consistently cooked up a savory roux of genres: folk, ambient, hip-hop, classical, and contemporary R&B. It is the contrasting mixture of cultures that defines her sound.

Starting off her set with "Did You Know," the opener on her latest Stones Throw LP, Athena, she explained that she got into the violin when she saw folk fiddlers perform at her elementary school. As a fourth-grader, she was immediately captivated and began learning what she said were "Irish jigs." This opened the door for her own musical ethnography. She soon learned about Sudanese, Czech, and Irish fiddlers. This was in part inspired by eclectic African music pioneer Francis Bebes, who also advocated for an internationalist perspective on music.
