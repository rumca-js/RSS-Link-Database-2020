When a man returning from Wuhan, China in January 2020 exhibited symptoms of the novel coronavirus, public health officials in the Seattle area were already on alert. “We had a game plan in place already,” says Dr. George Diaz, who treated patient one when he was admitted to Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett.

Yet in spite of the state’s preparedness, it would soon become clear that the virus’s spread was already ahead of efforts to contain it.

“Patient One: Saving America’s First Known Coronavirus Patient” was drawn from FRONTLINE’s reporting for “Coronavirus Pandemic” – veteran science reporter Miles O’Brien and his team’s investigation of the U.S. response to COVID-19.

“Coronavirus Pandemic” premieres Tues., April 21. Stream it on the PBS Video App starting at 7/6c, or watch it on PBS or YouTube at 9/8c. Check local PBS listings. More here: https://to.pbs.org/2ypGUOw
