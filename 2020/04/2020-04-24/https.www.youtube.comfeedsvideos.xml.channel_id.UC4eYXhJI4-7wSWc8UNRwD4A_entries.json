But when DJ Dahi reverses samples\u2014 or alters his voice\u2014 to produce hits for the likes of Pusha T, Kendrick Lamar or Childish Gambino, it's a ministry of texture and sound. \n\nWatch the second season early at npr.org/theformula\n\nREAD THE COMPANION ESSAY\n\u201cKendrick Lamar's 'Money Trees' Is A Time Machine\u201d by Jeff Weiss\nAnother song by Kendrick Lamar \u2014 this one produced by DJ Dahi \u2014 that uses a sample to change the flow of time. For writer Jeff Weiss, 'Money Trees' has the uncanny ability \u2014 at any time, in any mood \u2014 to drop him into a single night in 2015.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nApril 24, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- When John Fogerty breaks out his baseball bat guitar and swings into that famous guitar lick from \"Centerfield\" to open his Tiny Desk (home) concert, I can almost taste the Cracker Jacks. Welcome to Fogerty's Factory, the tricked-out basement where the Fogerty Family (John, his sons Tyler and Shane, and his daughter Kelsy) make music in these quarantined times. His desk is the road case his band Creedence Clearwater Revival used when they played Woodstock, and John shows off a guitar he played at the festival as well. He plays three of his CCR classics from 50 years ago (still singing in the same key), surrounded by family and sending out words of encouragement to all of us.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Centerfield\"\n\"Down On The Corner\"\n\"Long As I Can See The Light\"\n\"Proud Mary\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qW2139LKN0", "date_published": "2020-04-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
