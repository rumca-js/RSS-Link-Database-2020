On this episode of The Vile VIllager, Rob and Jake round up their villagers, trap them behind fences, and craft a maze riddled with Pitfall's for them to navigate.

The Vile Villager has returned, and this time they won't be satisfied with simply toying with their animal neighbors. This time, they want to lock their animal "friends" into cages. Because that's a perfectly normal thing a sane person would do in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

In the video above, Rob Handlery and Jake Dekker continue their villainous undertaking to craft the most vile villager they can. Not content with simply rounding everyone up, the two decide to go a step further and turn their victims' prison into an elaborate maze that's riddled with pitfalls. It looks exactly as diabolical as it sounds.

There's plenty of other activities to do in New Horizons if you don't want to be mean to your neighbors. The game's latest limited-time event has begun, attracting the flower bush-selling Leif to your island. He's not the only new visitor either, as Redd has returned from previous games in order to sell you some new art. Take advantage of both sellers to pretty up your island--you never know when you might need to host a celebrity who wants to take advantage of your turnip prices.

This week on Good News Gaming, we take a look at some of the incredible things people are doing from home while socially distancing themselves. A group of Halo Reach fans finally manage to land a trick jump that they've been working on for 10 whole years, and a group of friends make an IRL Diablo-style RPG for their friend, who had to cancel their bachelor party. 

We're still deep into Animal Crossing memes and this week we're taking a look at the best KK Slider album covers out there, as well as learning about a cut feature from Fable. We also see NVIDIA's impressive RTX Voice in action.

## What We Want From A Resident Evil 4 Remake

Capcom is reportedly working on a remake of Resident Evil 4. Jean-Luc talks about a few major things he’d like to see in it that could improve an already excellent game.

What could a Resident Evil 4 remake look like? This particular question has been on the minds of Resident Evil fans ever since a report recently surfaced saying that Capcom is planning on remaking Resident Evil 4. Will it be a faithful recreation in the RE Engine or will Capcom follow in the footsteps of its most recent remakes and make larger changes to the game? Heck, does it even need to be changed?

In the video above, Jean-Luc tackles all these questions. While Resident Evil 4 remains  fantastic, no game is without flaws and refinements can always be made to better the experience. He discusses how the near-universally disliked Ashley could be improved, how the second half could be made even stronger, and how Capcom could go about handling preserving the campy dialogue that made the game so endearing.

While it still isn’t officially confirmed whether Capcom is planning on remaking Resident Evil 4, the possibility of us seeing one in the near future seems more likely than ever before. Capcom had great success in the past with the re-release of Resident Evil 1 remake, as well as the recently released Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. You can check out our reviews for the latter two games over on GameSpot.com or on our YouTube channel.

Persia brings you all the biggest gaming stories for your April 23 Save State. Red Dead Redemption 2 is coming to Xbox One's Game Pass on May 7 and is already available for pre-download. It will also include Red Dead Online. GTA V will be leaving the service on the same day. 

In Netflix news, Castlevania Season 4 is confirmed and Pokemon Journeys will arrive on the streaming service on June 12th. In other news, Valve is not worried about the recent Team Fortress and CS:GO leaks since they are from older versions of the game, and have no effect on the 2020 builds. Battlefield V has one more update on the way but a lot more community-oriented events are in the works this summer.

## The Horrifying True Story Behind The Dark Pictures: Little Hope

Little Hope is the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology, following Man of Medan. That game was based on a sunken Indonesian ship, the Ourang Medan, and Little Hope is likewise based on a true story. Its New England setting may bring the Salem Witch Trials to mind, but that's not quite where developer Supermassive Games pulled its inspiration from.

Little Hope is actually based on the often overlooked Andover Witch Trials, which occurred north of Salem. Tony dives into the history of these events in the video above, explaining how they're deadlier than the stories often taught in history class.

Little Hope itself has no specific release date, but it's slated for PS4, Xbox One, and PC this summer. Pre-orders are open now.
