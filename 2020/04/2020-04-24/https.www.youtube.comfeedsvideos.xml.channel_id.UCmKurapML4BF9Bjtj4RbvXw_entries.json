To never give up on the probability that bad things will ultimately work for our good. That trials often ultimately become blessings. Of maintaining hope and gratitude under all circumstances\n\nFav lyric from the song:\nevery long lost dream led me to where you are\nOthers who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars\nPointing me on my way into your loving arms\n\nLyrics:\nI set out on a narrow way many years ago\nHoping I would find true love along the broken road\nBut I got lost a time or two\nWiped my brow and kept pushing through\nI couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you\nThat every long lost dream led me to where you are\nOthers who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars\nPointing me on my way into your loving arms\nThis much I know is true\nThat God blessed the broken road\nThat led me straight to you\nYes, He did\nI think about the years I spent just passin' through\nI'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you\nBut you just smile and take my hand\nYou've been there, you understand\nIt's all part of a grander plan that is coming true\nEvery long lost dream led me to where you are\nOthers who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars\nPointing me on my way into your loving arms\nThis much I know is true\nThat God blessed the broken road\nThat led me straight to you\nYeah\nAnd now I'm just a-rollin' home\nInto my lover's arms\nThis much I know is true\nThat God blessed the broken road\nThat led me straight to you\nThat God blessed the broken road\nThat led me straight to you\n\nCheck out our Top 10 videos!\n____________________________\nA Thousand Years (Christina Perri) https://youtu.be/QgaTQ5-XfMM\nDisney's Let It Go / Vivaldi's Winter (Frozen / Four Seasons)  https://youtu.be/6Dakd7EIgBE\nBeethoven's 5 Secrets (5th Symphony / OneRepublic) https://youtu.be/mJ_fkw5j-t0\nTitanium / Pavane (David Guetta / Faure) https://youtu.be/fz4MzJTeL0c\nWhat Makes You Beautiful (One Direction) https://youtu.be/0VqTwnAuHws\nPeponi / Paradise African Version (Coldplay) https://youtu.be/Cgovv8jWETM\nCello Wars (Star Wars) https://youtu.be/BgAlQuqzl8o\nFight Song / Amazing Grace - Scotland Castle Eilean Donan (Rachel Platten / John Newton) https://youtu.be/mOO5qRjVFLw\nStory of My Life (One Direction) https://youtu.be/yET4p-r2TI8\n\nWatch us play atop the Wonders of the World!\n____________________________\nGreat Wall of China: https://youtu.be/NCaH-qqTWpk\nChrist Redeemer: https://youtu.be/CHV6BjuQOZQ\nChichen Itza: https://youtu.be/O3cBZ5X-eGw\nPetra: https://youtu.be/u2Yk1CEgc4g\n(MORE to come)\n\nWho are The Piano Guys?\nhttps://thepianoguys.com/pages/about\n\nMusic Produced and Arranged by Jon Schmidt \nEngineered and Mixed by Jake Bowen \nRecorded and Mixed  at big idea music studios, Sandy, Utah\nMastered by Al Van Der Beek at TPG Studios Sandy, Utah\nPerformed by       \nJon Schmidt: Piano\nYamaha C7 Disklavier Pro Piano tuning and regulation by\nRick Baldassin - Baldassin Performance Pianos\n\nspecial thanks from big idea music productions inc to:\nKIMBER KABLE - Ray Kimber, Exponential Audio (Izotope) Michael Carnes, FDW|Worldwide - Buzz Goodwin, Harman Pro,  Lexicon, SHURE - Ryan Smith, TASCAM - Johnny Deleon, TC|HELICON - Kevin Alexander, WEST LA MUSIC - Don Griffin, VSL - Stefan Steinbauer,  Sweetwater - Ted Hunter,  Guitar Center - Mitchell Mu\u00f1oz", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ZQK5NmVG1g", "date_published": "2020-04-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
