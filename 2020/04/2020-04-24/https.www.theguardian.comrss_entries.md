<p>The 25-1 available about Playa Del Puente in the QEII Cup, the most valuable contest on Sunday morning’s Sky Sports Racing-televised card form Hong Kong, is well worth taking.</p><p>There is something damning about the “enterprisingly ridden” tag, in relation to a racehorse, the implication being that he couldn’t have achieved the same placing on merit. Surely that explains the 25-1 available about <strong>Playa Del Puente (9.40am)</strong> in the QEII Cup, the most valuable of three Group One races on Sunday morning’s card at Sha Tin in Hong Kong, to be shown live on Sky Sports Racing.<br /><br />It is worth considering that the progressive four-year-old deserved his second place in last month’s Hong Kong Derby, for all that Blake Shinn showed good awareness of the muddling early pace. Yes, the jockey made an astute decision to press the button before the end of the back straight. But it was Playa Del Puente who had the ability to pass the entire field in the space of about a furlong and then to pull clear as those rivals were asked to chase him.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/doping-charges-against-top-trainers-leave-us-horse-racing-desperate-to-clean-up-sport">Doping charges for top trainers leave US racing desperate to clean up sport | Greg Wood</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/25/talking-horses-playa-del-puente-can-lift-the-qeii-cup-at-generous-odds-horse-racing-tips">Continue reading...</a>

Names flew out of the ring as fast as they stepped in. Increased scrutiny on the person in charge, with the game professionalising, led some of those on the shortlist to withdraw. Others were poached from under the FA’s nose. Hence Phil Neville moving to the front of the pack having not even been on the start line. The FA will be desperate to avoid a repeat. Ideally, it would like a woman to take the reins but it would be remiss to rule out some of the finest managers in the women’s game on account of their gender.

<p>Europe is in the pandemic frontline but unity among the nations has been rare. That may be changing – not before time</p><p>Almost seven weeks after the World Health Organization confirmed the pandemic, Europe remains in <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" title="">the frontline</a> of the battle to contain the Covid-19 virus. Five of the six countries reporting most cases are in Europe. Seven of the 10 countries reporting most deaths are in our continent too. Yet Europe has struggled to make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-our-nations-are-self-isolating-too" title="">common cause</a> against the virus. In particular, it has bickered over how to support the most affected European economies against the consequences of the lockdown. In spite of innumerable acts of cross-border solidarity on the medical front, the rich nations of Europe have proved reluctant backers of the continent’s embattled poorer economies.</p><p>The good news, relatively speaking, is that this divide has not got worse and may, just possibly, have eased a little. This week, leaders of the 27 EU nations finally signed off on a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/clashes-predicted-over-trillion-euro-covid-19-aid-as-eu-meets-online" title="">€540bn rescue package</a>. This gives countries such as Italy and Spain, which stand second and third to the United States in Covid-19 cases and deaths, the right to borrow from the eurozone’s bailout mechanism. The problem is that the EU’s southern member states are reluctant to borrow their way out of the problem, in part because they fear that to take on more debt would deepen the inequality between the EU’s south and north.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-and-covid-19-better-late-than-never">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on universities: a bailout is in all our interests | Editorial

<p>By helping to solve a short-term funding crisis, ministers could signal their plans for a national recovery</p><p>There is no reason why Britain’s universities should suffer permanent damage as a result of coronavirus. But, like many other institutions, they will need support in order to avoid it. The immediate issue is the present. The deaths from Covid-19 of people such as <a href="https://www.nursingtimes.net/news/coronavirus/nursing-student-and-agency-nurse-die-in-coronavirus-outbreak-15-04-2020/" title="">Ade Raymond</a>, who was studying for a nursing degree at Middlesex university, will leave big gaps.</p><p>On top of such personal losses comes the virus’s wider impact. While lectures and teaching continue online, the removal of access to libraries and laboratories, and, above all, to people, takes a toll – particularly on students in their final year, or on one-year courses. Following <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/feb/20/thousands-of-university-workers-strike-across-uk" title="">February’s strikes</a>, some will feel they have lost half a year of their higher education. Those reliant on income from casual work (often in retail or catering), or tied into rental agreements for shared houses, risk increased debts and other hardships.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-universities-a-bailout-is-in-all-our-interests">Continue reading...</a>

It’s seven years too late to ask</p><p>My wife and I decided to see what all the fuss is about with this show called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/game-of-thrones" title="">Game Of Thrones</a>. I would like to say I haven’t seen it because I haven’t got round to it, but the truth is I have a history of not engaging with things for the sake of being a contrarian. Everybody was talking about it and so I wilfully avoided it, although I was pretty sure I would like it.</p><p>I have given up on that philosophy. I saw a post on Facebook, something like: “I have never seen a single episode of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-sopranos" title="">The Sopranos</a> and people look at me like I’m a unicorn.” I realised I didn’t want to be that unicorn and watched all six series of The Sopranos in a single sitting.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/24/im-finally-watching-game-of-thrones-and-its-made-me-a-total-pearl-clutcher">Continue reading...</a>

She’d learned that (once again) she had not got the promotion she’d applied for. Apparently the interview committee were not sure about her “leadership qualities”, despite her qualification in leadership. They were sure about the young(er) men they hired instead: floppy-haired elite-school types who refused to wear socks and went by nicknames that sounded like abuse (no employee deserves to be reprimanded by someone called Plumpers).</p><p>My friend told me that she would not put herself up for promotion again.

Those letters describe suppers where Alan Bennett tries to work out the German for “motherfucker”, borrowing a saw from Jonathan Miller (and failing to return it), and many more encounters with other famous neighbours such as Claire Tomalin and Michael Frayn. That’s not to mention the acid wit of Wilmers herself and the charm of Stibbe’s own voice. The book was a hit: “Charming, but only in the best ways,” according to the New York Times. “I could quote from it forever.

In fact, as her <a href="https://twitter.com/readealexandra/status/1187621717830594560?s=21">tweets</a> and emails to reporters, media outlets, politicians and organizations demonstrate, Reade has been trying to tell her story for nearly a year, but was ignored or turned away. That is why she wound up telling her story publicly for the first time to me on my podcast.</p><p>I’m an independent writer and podcaster. I don’t hide my politics, nor am I an “objective” investigative reporter with the resources of a legacy publication. But in March, a friend, herself a sexual assault survivor, said she’d spoken to a woman named Tara Reade, who had told her a credible story about being sexually assaulted by Joe Biden and asked me to speak with her. I agreed to speak to Reade and the people she said she’d told about the alleged assault at the time, and if her story seemed credible, I’d do my best to put her in touch with a journalist who could do her story justice. I spoke to Reade and her confidants, and reviewed documents. There seemed much to Reade’s story, and I moved ahead to find her help.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-tara-reade-deserves-to-be-heard-katie-halper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sex isn’t just for the young. Maintaining intimacy in our relationships is just as important as we age, says psychologist Anjula Mutanda</p><p>For too long, we’ve been taught to associate sex with youth. When we’re younger, the message is: expect to have great sex, good body confidence and feel wonderful. These powerful slogans have subtly played their part in making people feel invisible from midlife onwards. But more recently, we’ve come to realise that the sex lives of people in their 50s, 60s and beyond are just as valid. As people are living longer, getting healthier and paying more attention to their physical and emotional wellbeing, they’re starting to say: “I still feel desirable.”</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-taboo/2020/apr/09/dont-let-a-weak-bladder-stop-you-doing-the-things-you-love">Don’t let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-last-taboo/2020/apr/24/older-wiser-sexier-the-secret-to-great-sex-in-midlife">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Every morning I wake up at 7am when our gibbon, Jimmy, starts singing. But under lockdown, it’s always quiet</p><p>I live in the keepers’ lodge in London zoo. It’s a big shared house on site where eight zookeepers run a rota to care for the animals and man phones overnight. My mum loves telling people I live in Regent’s Park. I grew up in an animal-loving household. At one point there was me, Mum and Dad, two cats, two dogs, two rabbits, a hamster, a tortoise and a cockatoo, so it is normal for me to be surrounded by animals.</p><p>After studying marine biology at university, I worked for the RSPCA, taking in injured seals and ducklings near the Norfolk coast. But I had always had my sights set on London zoo. For two weeks, I went there every day, handing out my CV to anyone in a suit until I got an interview. I started work as a zookeeper in November 2001.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/24/experience-i-live-in-a-zoo">Continue reading...</a>

## Summer fun will still be out there. But will it kill you? | Grace Dent

<p>‘I’ve found myself dreaming of Pizza Express dough balls. Not the food, but all that it symbolises: friendship and silly, unplanned Friday nights’</p><p>As I lingered, mask-free, by the pickles at Sainsbury’s, it struck me that risking my life is now easier. Five weeks in, and I am weary of worrying. I am news-saturated, knackered and listless. I wanted, in that moment, to shop freely. “Maybe I die, maybe I don’t,” I thought as I bought coleslaw raffishly. After five weeks in the house being obedient, a devil-may-careness has set in.<br /><br />Perhaps I’ll be one of those people who die doing something they love, I wondered, which until recently was an epitaph reserved only for vagabonds, Wall of Death stunt riders, wingsuiters and those folk who are hell-bent on keeping 20ft saltwater crocodiles as pets. “We all told her Colin wasn’t her friend, but a 2,000lb opportunistic, hyper-carnivorous predator. But, hey, she died doing something she loved.”<br /><br />But risking your life, from now on, will be different. We’re all going to have to get good and comfy with it; we cannot hide for ever. The findings on Covid-19 are hazy, and enough people already think: “Oh well, life must go on.” Industry is itching to get going. The new world, as far as I can see, seems to come with the sort of disclaimer you see at a dodgy fun fair: “All amusement is at the patron’s own risk.” If you want to drink Pimm’s in a sunny beer garden with friends, then off you should trot, if your nerve lets you. How about a beach picnic with – and I’m being quite bold here – a reckless game of Swingball? You’ll need a gang of fellow-minded nihilists and a strong sense of throwing caution to the wind. Summer fun will still be out there; there will be barbecues and maybe even the odd restaurant. But it will be followed by a new type of regret: the Covid-19 shame hangover. A tricky 10 days during which you’ll wonder whether that cough is down to your choice to smoke an ill-advised Embassy Red, or your choice to share a karaoke mic with five other super-spreaders. Did your night out actually kill you? Will your final public words be: “Guys, isn’t that ball pit, um, a risk?”<br /><br />But I’m jumping the gun. Right now, it feels risky, to me at least, to use one of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/16/burger-king-kfc-and-pret-announce-limited-reopenings">the 10 recently reopened branches of Pret A Manger</a>, even if they do strictly follow the guidelines and offer a brief taste of pre-Covid humdrum. Oh, Pret … A jambon beurre and a peach green tea. A crayfish salad, a Love Bar and a disappointing coffee. Pret was a thing I did almost subliminally, often mainly for a few minutes of downtime, sat quietly alone in the middle of dozens of strangers, sharing tiny tables, breathing each others’ recycled air and scrolling mindlessly through our phones. I long to be mindless in public again.<br /><br />But now Pret is back – very gently, sort of – as are some Nando’s, and soon KFC, too, all very importantly now observing the guidelines. Except they’re guidelines that no one important can really agree on. If you find the ones suggested on Sky News at midday too draconian, try the ones on the BBC at teatime, because they may be more affable. You can do this while making your own safety mask from an old T-shirt, the wearing of which in public is vitally important for safety, but also, apparently, futile and, if you think about it, might potentially increase your risk. Which is it? Who knows? No one, that’s who. Now eat your Zinger Tower and shut up.<br /><br />As the world throws up many more questions than answers, I’ve found myself dreaming of Pizza Express dough balls. Not the food, as such, but all that it symbolises: friendship and silly, unplanned Fridays where everyone gets together at the last minute. I miss arriving at a busy table just as the first portion of dough balls is being delivered, getting slagged off (again) for being the one who is always late, and apologising (again) to Tom, who always gets there promptly. I miss bottles of warm red wine and four stories on the go at once as everyone fights to finish their opening anecdote, before giving up.</p><p>I miss so much talking and no one finishing any story ever. I miss sloppy, occasionally sub-standard pizzas and endless laughing and saying we don’t want pudding, then ordering some for sharing anyway. I miss standing outside in the street afterwards, tipsy, a little bit noisy, egging each other on to go to a pub, just for one, maybe more. And some people escaping, claiming they’re tired, but then hugging and kissing and goodbyes and even more laughing. If I go home and die two weeks later, at least I’ll have died doing something I loved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/24/summer-fun-will-still-be-out-there-maybe-even-the-odd-restaurant-but-will-your-night-out-kill-you-grace-dent">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Schools in northern Italy were the first in Europe to close. Since then, teachers, parents and kids across the country have all had to adapt to a new existence – and the results have surprised everyone. By Tobias Jones</p><p>Most of us in Emilia-Romagna, in northern Italy, remember the weekend of 22 February very clearly. To begin with there were just rumours – phone calls and messages flying around between friends – but then it was confirmed: all schools in the region were going to close for a week.</p><p>The decision was, in many ways, shocking. At that time, there had only been three deaths from Covid-19 in Italy, and only 152 reported infections. It seemed strange that education was the first social activity to be sacrificed.

<p>She’s faced abuse, depression – and now coronavirus has killed two of her friends. But the revered singer-songwriter is coming out swinging with her most political album yet</p><p>Lucinda Williams has been sleep-talking more than usual. One night last week, she dreamed that Mormons invaded her house, converted her friends and stole her possessions. That wasn’t the issue: “They were all sitting next to each other, and I said: ‘Don’t you understand, you’re supposed to be quarantined!’” Williams laughs, her laconic outlaw baritone spilling into a surprising giggle. Her husband and manager, Tom Overby, told her she had grown agitated in her sleep. She thinks it came from the nightly TV marathons that have become their new lockdown routine, staying up until 5am watching the Jewish drama <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81019069">Unorthodox</a>, “only in my dream they came out as Mormons”.</p><p>Wiggy dreams are a quarantine staple, but Williams has had a lot to process lately. She and Overby only recently moved to Nashville and don’t yet have any furniture. No sooner had they arrived than a tornado hit the city, although not their neighbourhood. Then coronavirus killed two old friends: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/hal-willner-music-producer-and-snl-supervisor-dies-aged-64">Hal Willner</a>, who produced Williams’s 2007 album, West, and the country musician <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-us-folk-and-country-songwriter-dies-aged-73">John Prine</a>. She last saw Prine in November when she played his festival in the Dominican Republic. “It’s been insane,” she says in disbelief, calling from her home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/24/lucinda-williams-i-dont-mind-pushing-peoples-buttons">Continue reading...</a>
