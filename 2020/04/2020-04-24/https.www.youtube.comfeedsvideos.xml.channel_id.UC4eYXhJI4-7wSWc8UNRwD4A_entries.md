Spinning records backwards was once condemned as satanic. But when DJ Dahi reverses samples— or alters his voice— to produce hits for the likes of Pusha T, Kendrick Lamar or Childish Gambino, it's a ministry of texture and sound.

READ THE COMPANION ESSAY
“Kendrick Lamar's 'Money Trees' Is A Time Machine” by Jeff Weiss
Another song by Kendrick Lamar — this one produced by DJ Dahi — that uses a sample to change the flow of time. For writer Jeff Weiss, 'Money Trees' has the uncanny ability — at any time, in any mood — to drop him into a single night in 2015. That essay is here: https://n.pr/2Y6PsEO

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

April 24, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- When John Fogerty breaks out his baseball bat guitar and swings into that famous guitar lick from "Centerfield" to open his Tiny Desk (home) concert, I can almost taste the Cracker Jacks. Welcome to Fogerty's Factory, the tricked-out basement where the Fogerty Family (John, his sons Tyler and Shane, and his daughter Kelsy) make music in these quarantined times. His desk is the road case his band Creedence Clearwater Revival used when they played Woodstock, and John shows off a guitar he played at the festival as well. He plays three of his CCR classics from 50 years ago (still singing in the same key), surrounded by family and sending out words of encouragement to all of us.

SET LIST

"Centerfield"
"Down On The Corner"
"Long As I Can See The Light"
"Proud Mary"
