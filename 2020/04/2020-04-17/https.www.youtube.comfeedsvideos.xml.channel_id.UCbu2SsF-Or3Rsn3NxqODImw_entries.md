Think your easter egg eagle eyes can beat ours? Good luck, because ours were forged in the fires of Fort Condor. See if you caught all of these references and callbacks to the original Final Fantasy 7 in the remake!

Final Fantasy 7 Remake brings back Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, Barret, and the city of Midgar some 23 years after the release of the original game. The remake is an expanded retelling of the first part of the original's story, adding new events, new dialogue, and new character development--but much of what appeared in the 1997 FF7 has been brought back, either in an updated form, or as a callback to the PSX classic.

Where FF7 Remake isn't exactly retelling the original game's tale, it's littered with Final Fantasy 7 jokes, references, callbacks, and Easter eggs. We've compiled a huge list of those callbacks, ranging from visual cues and graphically updated recreations, to tiny in-jokes meant to impress die-hard fans. Check them all out in the video above.

We've scoured just about every inch of Final Fantasy 7 Remake to discover every secret and collectible hidden in Midgar. Head over to our rundown of Final Fantasy 7 Remake guides and walkthroughs for every strategy, secret, and tip you need to get everything out of the game.

## How to Unlock Final Fantasy 7 Remake's Best Summon

Unlocking new summons in Final Fantasy 7 Remake can be tough. While a few of the game's most powerful Materia come your way as part of the story and as you explore Midgar, most require you to test your battle skills in Chadley's VR combat simulator as part of the Battle Intel side-quest. But it's only after you finish all 19 Battle Intel assignments that you'll get access to the final summon that Chadley has to offer.

That summon, as Final Fantasy fans might have guessed, is the frighteningly lethal dragon Bahamut. Like Chadley's other summons, Shiva, Chocobo and Moogle, and Leviathan, you have to best Bahamut in battle in order to add it to your collection. Even near max level and having returned to the game after unlocking the Chapter Select menu, Bahamut is a difficult contender. He has a bunch of powerful moves that do a ton of damage, and he's an aggressive fighter who will harass you to keep you from casting spells or healing your team.

Check out the video above to see how best to take down Bahamut--we recommend going after the summon in one of the later chapters when you have a full team of three, and bringing along your strongest weapons and defensive armor to mitigate the damage you'll take. The key to beating Bahamut is staggering him, so equip Materia that helps you charge your ATB meters and use abilities that'll raise the dragon's stagger meter to take it down.

We've got a whole lot more FF7 information to help you through--check out our rundown of Final Fantasy 7 Remake tips, walkthroughs, and guides.

## 6 Final Fantasy 7 Remake Combat Tips You Need To Know

Final Fantasy 7 Remake reinvents the combat systems of the 1997 original. Instead of a turn-based, menu-filled approach to fights, FF7 Remake goes the action-RPG route, allowing you to run around the battlefield, dodge blows, block incoming attacks, and unleash your own combos. But in addition to familiar hack-and-slash gameplay, the remake also mixes in elements of the original, allowing you to cast spells, give your teammates menu-based orders, or take direct control of other members of your party at any time.

The result is a combat system that's a mix of twitch attacks and strategic planning, where each character has unique abilities and actions, and using your whole party together is the only way to be effective. FF7 Remake will throw some tough battles at you throughout the game, including some intense, multi-stage boss fights that will require all of your skills to make you through. We've compiled a series of tips to help you excel at Final Fantasy 7 Remake's combat and claim victory against anything the game throws your way.

Check out the video above, which will help you use each character effectively, outfit your squad, and tackle any situation.
