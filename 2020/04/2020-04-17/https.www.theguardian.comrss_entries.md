<p>Character actor known for the films First Blood and Cocoon, and in his stage work a genuine colossus</p><p>Built like a truck but with the capacity to be as gentle as a pussycat, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/16/brian-dennehy-actor-dies-aged-81">Brian Dennehy</a> was smarter than the average bear-like character actor. The 6ft 3in performer, who has died aged 81 from a heart attack resulting from sepsis, made his screen breakthrough as an adversarial small-town sheriff in First Blood (1982), the thoughtful opening instalment in what would become the Rambo action series. It was the first in his hat-trick of hits from that decade: he also twinkled benignly as one of a group of aliens who have a rejuvenating effect on an elderly community in Cocoon (1985) and played a grizzled but amiable cop in F/X (1986), an enjoyable thriller set in the special effects industry; it was popular enough to spawn a 1991 sequel in which he also starred.</p><p>Unusually for a character actor, he had a handful of movie leads, including The Belly of an Architect (1987), a rare foray into arthouse cinema. Dennehy’s extraordinary range, from cowering vulnerability to a fury fit to scare the gods, was given full rein in the British director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/peter-greenaway">Peter Greenaway</a>’s otherwise austere tale of an esteemed architect dying of stomach cancer; the critic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/janet-maslin">Janet Maslin</a> called it “one of the best things” the actor had done. He also gave a complex and probing performance as the serial killer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/12/john-wayne-gacy-victims-search">John Wayne Gacy</a> in the TV mini-series To Catch a Killer (1992).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/brian-dennehy-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

The vocation of social care deserves the same status </p><p>During the past week, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, has been the butt of much-deserved criticism over the mishandling of the coronavirus crisis in care homes. On crucial issues, from testing for the disease to the provision of protective equipment to employees, the government’s response has been unacceptably sluggish and inadequate.</p><p>Given that depressing backdrop, it was understandable that Mr Hancock’s unveiling of an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/hannocks-shiny-badge-emblem-of-a-scamper-into-tigger-mode" title="">NHS-style green badge</a> for care workers was treated with a degree of derision.

<p>Chelsea midfielder feels she’s not being given a chance by England after the Eni Aluko fallout but feels valued by her club</p><p>“I’m not saying I deserve to be in the England squad but I think I deserve to have been given a chance,” says Drew Spence, Chelsea’s longest serving player. A new two-year contract signed in March will take the 27-year-old into her 13th year with the club. Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager’s plans.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/womens-football-faced-with-existential-threat-from-coronavirus-pandemic">Women's football faced with 'existential threat' from coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/17/drew-spence-phils-not-spoken-to-me-once-is-it-because-of-what-happened">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The methods – whether it’s mass testing or contact-tracing – matter less than the huge shift in thinking that is required</p><p>Sometimes you’re just asking the wrong question. On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/uk-government-has-no-exit-plan-for-covid-19-lockdown-say-sources">when will the lockdown end</a>? But that’s the wrong question.</p><p>Imagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they’re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn’t simply be asking “When?” They would be asking “When will it be <em>safe</em>?” which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn’t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won’t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we’ve ventured out?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/political-imagination-end-lockdown-mass-testing-contact-tracing">Continue reading...</a>

Indeed, those five tests themselves felt like the twitch of a phantom limb, redolent of the time Hancock announced his “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day">five pillars</a>”. Five pillars – like Islam, or the lost Temple of Cybele in Rome, or a Floridian McMansion where the contractor went bust halfway through completing the portico.</p><p>You don’t hear a whole lot about Matt’s five pillars these days, though the announcement of them did the job at the time. On Wednesday, Hancock drew attention away from the desperate shortage of PPE in care homes by re-announcing an NHS-style badge for those who work in care. Alas, in a development best described as ironicidal, the care badge website then swiftly ran into difficulties, leaving visitors greeted with the news that there was now a shortage of care badges. Until production is “ramped up”, it’s hard not to conclude that the chief success of the care badge was to form a psychic shield around the health secretary. It will, however, take more than a badge if he doesn’t hit his 100,000 tests a day target for the end of April, having already <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/testing-for-coronavirus-covid-19-will-increase-to-25-000-a-day">missed the 25,000-a-day</a> target for the middle of the month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/matt-hancock-dominic-raab-ppe-care-badges">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coronavirus is teaching us how to focus on the tasks that matter</p><p>From the minute we went into lockdown, there’s been a lively discussion, online and elsewhere, about how to fill <a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/healthandbeauty/health-and-fitness/2020040387411/productive-things-to-do-during-lockdown/">all our extra spare time</a>. We parents of small children permitted ourselves a hollow laugh at that (before immediately worrying that the hollow laugh was turning into a dry cough). Because for us, there was suddenly no time at all. Every waking second was accounted for, so the advice that we might seize this opportunity to reread the novels of Jane Austen or dust off our half-written screenplays felt deeply surreal – and therefore, I suppose, entirely in keeping with the times.<br /><br />There’s nothing new about people having radically different quantities of time, of course – nor about the fact that <a href="https://stateofopportunity.michiganradio.org/post/time-poverty">time inequality</a> doesn’t line up with economic inequality. (Low-income workers and senior executives wish they had more time; unemployed people and super-wealthy layabouts would be happier with less.) But never before has the distribution of time divided my social circle so sharply, providing another reminder that this thing we’re all doing these days is, in fact, a completely different thing, depending on who you are – rich or poor, parent or not, nurse or novelist, homebody or compulsive socialiser.<br /></p><p>Now I rarely doubt I’m spending my time on things that matter.

<p>Streaming was supposed to be the music industry’s silver lining during the pandemic, but figures have been going down </p><p>Major album releases used to be put through a Large Hadron Collider of marketing, but now almost everything making those promotion particles accelerate has been switched off. So how do you push an album when the beamlines are down?</p><p>Concert cancellations were the first consequence of the coronavirus pandemic, but the music industry was hoping streaming could become a silver lining in an economic dark cloud. It was mistaken. The Official Charts Company (OCC) reported in the last week of March that audio streaming in the UK was up just 0.4% from the previous week. It added that 82.3% of the album chart came from streaming, up from 75.3% two weeks earlier. But streaming has only grown its share because physical sales have fallen. And while early numbers would naturally skew as people acclimatised to home working, the New York Times reported on 6 April that combined streams of the Top 200 on Spotify in the US slipped for the third consecutive week – hitting their lowest point of the year. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/17/everyones-stuck-at-home-so-why-are-people-streaming-less-music-lady-gaga-dua-lipa">Continue reading...</a>

Founder Jeff Bezos coined the phrase in the company’s early days, and it’s now deeply woven into the firm’s culture: it has appeared in every shareholder letter since 1997, and even adorns the building in which Bezos works. As tech reporter Alex Kantrowitz <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/607065/always-day-one-by-alex-kantrowitz/">writes</a>, “day one” means “inventing like a startup” – a call for continual improvement and innovation. Dynamism is in; complacency is out. For Bezos, “day two” is another name for<a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/company-news/2016-letter-to-shareholders"> death</a>.</p><p>However, it’s not always wise to take corporate self-description at face value. Still, given the staggering speed and scale of Amazon’s growth, it’s reasonable to think that its “day one” mentality has had something to do with its success. Since it was founded in 1994, Amazon has become one of the most valuable companies in the world, with a market capitalisation of just over $1tn at time of writing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/amazon-coronavirus-public-utility-workers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From donning school uniform to raiding the fancy-dress box, readers share how they are dressing while they are forced to work in the house</p><p>Two weeks ago, Bonita Waldman put on a gold lamé dress that had been crocheted by her 94-year-old mother 40 years ago. “It made me feel close to her,” she says. Her mother was very ill in a care home at the time. Waldman couldn’t visit her, or see anyone else, because of the lockdown. So she worked from home wearing extraordinary outfits and posting the results on Facebook to “cheer up” her friends.</p><p><br />She sent a photograph of herself wearing the dress to the care home where the staff printed it out to show her mother. Tragically, her mother died before she could see it. “It’s a sad story,” says Waldman, “but it is also a happy one in a way, because I have these dresses that she made.” Waldman says she will wear more of her mother’s exquisite creations during lockdown, including the wedding dress her mother crocheted for her, as well as “funny outfits” – such as a flamenco dress – to raise friends’ and colleagues’ spirits, as well as her own.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/17/im-trying-to-make-working-from-home-as-fun-as-i-can-what-readers-are-wearing-in-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

The second World Cup semi-final at Twickenham in 1999 seems like yesterday to me even though Émile Ntamack, France’s left-wing on that autumn day, now watches his son play for their country. No one in the stadium will ever forget it. At the end, and I kid you not, I turned round from my seat in the East stand press box and grown men were actually weeping.</p><p>Context is all. This wasn’t just an astonishing spectacle. It came, like so many French performances in World Cups, completely out of the blue. The All Blacks were so far ahead of everyone it wasn’t true. Jonah Lomu was in his pomp and their backline, with Christian Cullen, Tana Umaga and Jeff Wilson operating outside Andrew Mehrtens, were cutting other teams to shreds.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/17/my-favourite-game-france-v-new-zealand-1999-rugby-union-world-cup">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nicknamed ‘Norman bites yer legs’, the Leeds defender won 28 England caps but had his biggest successes at Elland Road</p><p>Norman Hunter had to wait 41 years for his World Cup winners’ medal – as a non-playing member of England’s 1966 squad he was not deemed entitled to one until the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/25/newsstory.sport9" title="">rules were eventually revised</a> – yet the Leeds United centre-half’s no-nonsense playing style is as fondly remembered today as any other from the era when televised football turned local heroes into household names.</p><p>Partly that is to do with the wonderfully apposite nickname that followed him around after the 1972 FA Cup final against Arsenal, when a banner in the Leeds end declaring “Norman bites yer legs” was spotted and commented on by the studio pundit Brian Clough. There was more than a grain of truth in the assertion, though rather than being a menace on the pitch Hunter, whose death at the age of 76 <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/17/norman-hunter-former-leeds-united-england-defender-dies-aged-76" title="">was confirmed on Friday</a>, was simply a brusquely physical defensive presence of a type common at the time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/17/how-norman-hunter-became-one-of-leeds-uniteds-biggest-legends">Continue reading...</a>

The group included Adrian Chiles, Dom Joly and Edwina Currie. One night we fetched up in a Bulgarian field; it was getting dark and we had to make camp for the night, which is how I came to share a very small tent on a hillside with former Olympic javelin champion Fatima Whitbread.</p><p>At 4am, Fatima nudged me awake to say, “I think someone is trying to get into the tent.” At first I thought it was a prank. I popped on a headlamp and lifted the tent flap to see my canvas bag disappearing into the pitch-black darkness. With the fuzzy logic and stern will of a sleep-deprived woman, I gave chase to the thief: a fox.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/17/experience-i-lost-a-fight-with-a-fox">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Low-paid women in US poultry factories are leading the struggle for fair conditions and basic safety. As Covid-19 rips through plants across the country, they have a fight on their hands. By Mya Frazier</p><p>It was only about an hour into Sophia’s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia’s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.</p><p>On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/chicken-factory-tyson-arkansas-food-workers-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wilson and her husband Tom Hanks’ Covid-19 diagnosis underlined how pervasive the disease could be. She talks about the grim side-effects of the drugs she took to combat it – and her rap-aided recovery</p><p>Precisely when political leaders of certain countries grasped how much of a threat coronavirus really would be is a debatable issue. But for many members of the public, a precise date can be put on when the truth properly struck home: 13 March. That was when Tom Hanks <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B9qBEyjJu4B/">announced</a> on Instagram that he and his wife, the actor and singer Rita Wilson, a couple who are universally agreed to be Two of the Nicest Celebrities in the World, had tested positive for the virus in Australia, where Hanks had been shooting Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis biopic. (Hanks, truly cast against type, is playing the notorious bully, Colonel Tom Parker.) On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/13/trevor-noah-tom-hanks-daily-show-recap-coronavirus">said</a>: “It’s almost like coronavirus chose Tom Hanks just to send a message to the rest of us.

Hanks and Wilson occupy a near unique sweet spot of seeming both normal and gobstoppingly famous, making their diagnoses seem all too relatable and totally bizarre.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/rita-wilson-tom-hanks-coronavirus-choloroquine-covid">Continue reading...</a>
