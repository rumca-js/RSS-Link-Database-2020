As Covid-19 rips through plants across the country, they have a fight on their hands. By Mya Frazier</p><p>It was only about an hour into Sophia\u2019s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia\u2019s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.</p><p>On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/chicken-factory-tyson-arkansas-food-workers-coronavirus\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/17/chicken-factory-tyson-arkansas-food-workers-coronavirus", "date_published": "2020-04-17 05:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Rita Wilson on coronavirus and chloroquine: \u2018I was so ill I could hardly stand\u2019", "description": "<p>Wilson and her husband Tom Hanks\u2019 Covid-19 diagnosis underlined how pervasive the disease could be.

But for many members of the public, a precise date can be put on when the truth properly struck home: 13 March. That was when Tom Hanks <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/B9qBEyjJu4B/\">announced</a> on Instagram that he and his wife, the actor and singer Rita Wilson, a couple who are universally agreed to be Two of the Nicest Celebrities in the World, had tested positive for the virus in Australia, where Hanks had been shooting Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic. (Hanks, truly cast against type, is playing the notorious bully, Colonel Tom Parker.)

Hanks and Wilson occupy a near unique sweet spot of seeming both normal and gobstoppingly famous, making their diagnoses seem all too relatable and totally bizarre.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/rita-wilson-tom-hanks-coronavirus-choloroquine-covid\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/rita-wilson-tom-hanks-coronavirus-choloroquine-covid", "date_published": "2020-04-17 05:00:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The story of one care home hit by coronavirus", "description": "<p>Julie Roche is a manager of a Buckinghamshire care home that usually has 45 residents.
