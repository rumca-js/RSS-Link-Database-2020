The first in a series of videos covering the Dwarves of Thorin’s Company.  Today, we cover brothers Balin and Dwalin from Balin's birth prior to Smaug's attack on Erebor to Dwalin's potential participation in the Battle of Dale and Balin's expedition to Moria.  My hope is that this series will help enrich our enjoyment of these characters in The Hobbit Trilogy.
