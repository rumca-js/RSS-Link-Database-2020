As a fourth-grader, she was immediately captivated and began learning what she said were \"Irish jigs.\" This opened the door for her own musical ethnography. She soon learned about Sudanese, Czech, and Irish fiddlers. This was in part inspired by eclectic African music pioneer Francis Bebes, who also advocated for an internationalist perspective on music.\n\nMORE FROM THIS SESSION\nNont for Sale https://youtu.be/47YlI7LtpCo\nPelicans in the Summer https://youtu.be/NQ-96t-1xt4\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\n#Electro #RNB #Violin", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpXtospJShw", "date_published": "2020-04-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Event companies pivot from festival stages to virus-testing tents (The Current Music News)", "description": "April 17, 2020: With music festivals called off, some live event companies are putting their skills to work building hospital extensions and virus-testing tents.
