Developed by the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud, psychoanalysis argues that the human mind contains within it three opposing forces, the superego, the ego and the id. Through the interpretation of dreams, Freud believed that we could access repressed thoughts, feelings and traumas which we like to think we have purged ourselves of but which, in fact, remain in our unconscious mind.

Todd Phillips' Joker (2019) is not a high-minded conflict between good and evil like many other comic book to film adaptations but a psychological drama focusing on a marginalised working-class man suffering from mental ill health. This makes it a useful object of study for exploring a school of psychiatric thought known as psychoanalytic theory or psychoanalysis.

In today's episode of What the Theory?, I use Joker (which stars Joaquin Pheonix and Robert De Niro) in order to introduce some of the key concepts of psychoanalytic theory and psychoanalysis. As well as Freud, I also take a brief look at the work of Jacques Lacan and Slavoj Žižek (although I hope to cover these more extensively in a future episode of What the Theory?).

We'll be taking a look at Freud's "topographical" model of the mind (consisting of the preconscious, conscious and unconscious mind) as well as his model of personality (consisting of the superego, ego and id) as well as the Oedipus Complex.
