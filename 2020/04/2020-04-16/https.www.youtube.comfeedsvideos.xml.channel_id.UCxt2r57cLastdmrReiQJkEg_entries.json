Through the interpretation of dreams, Freud believed that we could access repressed thoughts, feelings and traumas which we like to think we have purged ourselves of but which, in fact, remain in our unconscious mind.\n\nTodd Phillips' Joker (2019) is not a high-minded conflict between good and evil like many other comic book to film adaptations but a psychological drama focusing on a marginalised working-class man suffering from mental ill health. This makes it a useful object of study for exploring a school of psychiatric thought known as psychoanalytic theory or psychoanalysis.\n\nIn today's episode of What the Theory?, I use Joker (which stars Joaquin Pheonix and Robert De Niro) in order to introduce some of the key concepts of psychoanalytic theory and psychoanalysis. As well as Freud, I also take a brief look at the work of Jacques Lacan and Slavoj \u017di\u017eek (although I hope to cover these more extensively in a future episode of What the Theory?).\n\nWe'll be taking a look at Freud's \"topographical\" model of the mind (consisting of the preconscious, conscious and unconscious mind) as well as his model of personality (consisting of the superego, ego and id) as well as the Oedipus Complex.\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon at http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\n\nIf you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nTwitter: @Tom_Nicholas\nInstagram: @TomNicholasWTF\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/tomnicholas\nWebsite: http://www.tomnicholas.com\n\nStock footage provided by Videvo, downloaded from https://www.videvo.net\n\nAdditional stock footage provided by Videezy, downloaded from http://www.videezy.com\n\n#Freud #Psychoanalysis #Joker", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzvYjKgbFzw", "date_published": "2020-04-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
