So we're celebrating with a lightning round video featuring questions submitted by Patreon members.\n\nHey, you like coffee? Want to support the channel? Today I'm helping out a coffee company here in Dallas called Cultivar Coffee who have been hit hard by the pandemic.\n\nBuy some of their beans here (seriously, I drink this every day, it's awesome):\nhttps://cultivar-coffee.myshopify.com/collections/coffee\n\nOr, send me an e-gift card. It'll feed my caffeine habit and help keep them afloat during this rough time:\nhttps://squareup.com/gift/FNWYETC6H1RQM/order\n\nUSE THIS AS THE RECIPIENT EMAIL:\njoescott@standard.tv\n\nThanks everyone!\n\nJames Webb Telescope Updates:\nhttps://jwst.nasa.gov/content/status/index.html\n\nOxford Job Loss Study:\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/business-48760799\n\n\n\n\n\r\nFollow me at all my places!\r\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/answerswithjoe\r\nSnapchat: https://www.snapchat.com/add/answerswithjoe\r\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/answerswithjoe\r\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/answerswithjoe", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mFp-DWLtPM", "date_published": "2020-04-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
