The continent’s migrant workers face an unenviable choice: stay at work, often on the social care frontline, and potentially risk infection, or return to their home country jobless and stigmatised. </p><p>Many people from Europe’s poorest regions, who took advantage of freedom of movement, are now caught in a no-man’s land, with border closures, no repatriation flights if they’ve lost their low-paid jobs, few savings, and limited or no access to a state safety net by virtue of anomalous social security provisions. If they do manage to return home, some face the suspicion that they have brought the virus with them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/stranded-or-shunned-europes-migrant-workers-caught-in-no-mans-land">Continue reading...</a>

The overriding aim is to complete a reduced, 36-event season by the time the Tour Championship finishes in September in Atlanta.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/golf-returns-in-june-with-first-four-pga-tournaments-behind-closed-doors">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Apparently the soup, named after our ‘robust’ prime minister, is the coronavirus tonic the UK is gagging for</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Ah, I see we’re at the “politicising soup” part of the lockdown discourse. That’s good. We’re ahead of schedule: I thought it would be weeks before I would read bizarre puff pieces about the restorative powers of broth in the face of a coronavirus pandemic that the NHS is desperately firefighting with actual medicine, but no. I was naive, and wrong, and now <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/boris-broth-could-soup-speed-prime-ministers-recovery-coronavirus/">“Boris Broth” is here</a>, conjuring up images of Boris Johnson poaching pinkly in a hot bath before ladling the water off into a stockpot, and ruining my lockdown for ever. </p><p>What is Boris Broth? Well, at its core, it’s just well-intentioned chicken and vegetable soup, distributed to NHS key workers by the newly formed Yorkshire-based food charity <a href="https://www.food4heroes.co.uk/">Food4Heroes</a>. “Just like Boris, it’s invigorating, it’s robust and it’ll put colour in your cheeks,” F4H co-founder Mandy Guest told the <em>Telegraph</em>. And yes, I wish she hadn’t said “colour in your cheeks” either, because “Boris Broth” already sounds like the sort of restorative portions the PM has been spaffing around town for many years now. “It’s a sustaining tonic for those in good health and a restorative for those recovering from illness,” she continued. Again, this just looks like a 2am text message our prime minister might send to someone else’s girlfriend. This does not sound like an advertisement for soup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/boris-broth-lockdown-charity-coronavirus-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many people do not take out insurance for self-catering holiday homes in the UK, so what happens when it gets cancelled? </p><p><strong>Nick, 55, from Nottinghamshire writes: “A lot has been written about holidays abroad, most of which are covered by insurance, but what about holidays in the UK? I’ve booked and paid in full for two self-catering breaks, one in </strong><strong>May and </strong><strong>another </strong><strong>in July. </strong><strong>As with many people who book accommodation-only, I didn’t take out insurance. I’m about £1,000 out of pocket</strong><strong> as </strong><strong>both companies are refusing to refund me, even though I paid the full balance long before I had to. They are only offering to defer the date but that is only helpful if I can get the time off work and the accommodation I originally booked is available. What is the best course of action?”</strong></p><p>Several readers have asked about self-catering holidays in the UK that have been cancelled due to the lockdown. Are they entitled to a refund? While the Package Travel Regulations extend to package holidays in the UK, they do not cover accommodation-only bookings. Each accommodation provider has its own terms and conditions. Since quarantine, the majority have updated their terms to offer a change of date or credit note instead of a refund. Frustratingly, most providers are advising guests who want a refund to claim on their holiday insurance, even though, like Nick, few people take out insurance for a UK holiday. For Nick, the best, in fact the only, course of action is to accept the postponement and hope the companies he booked with will be flexible with new dates. The same advice applies to anyone with an accommodation booking: the only option is to contact the provider directly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/apr/16/can-i-get-refund-on-uk-holiday-accommodation-travel-insurance-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

## We owe care workers so much more than a badge and some applause | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>The job is hard, exhausting and crucial. Those who do it must be recognised with decent pay and employment rights</p><p>It’s strange watching a narrative shift in real time. But then, everything is strange these days. Attitudes that would ordinarily take years, even decades, to shift seem in a state of emergency to transform overnight. Mere weeks ago, migrant care workers were included in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/low-skilled-migrants-government-cracking-down">“low-skilled” category of worker</a> by the Home Office, and barred from entering the UK under new, post-Brexit immigration rules. Now, everyone from the Queen and Matt Hancock to your clapping neighbours is lauding them as key workers. They even get a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/hannocks-shiny-badge-emblem-of-a-scamper-into-tigger-mode">special badge</a>, which reads more like an imperative: “CARE”.</p><p>I’ve wanted the Conservative party to care for a long time. For most of my adult life, I’ve watched it decimate public services. My husband works in the social care sector, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/11/voting-labour-boris-johnson-disabled-people-health-social-care">my brother</a>, who is severely autistic, is in the full-time care of the state. I am not alone in this: so many of us love someone who is reliant on the people working in our social care system or works in the system. We have long lamented the low pay and even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/16/social-care-an-afterthought-in-uk-coronavirus-response-says-leaked-letter">lower respect</a> afforded to care workers but until the coronavirus pandemic, few people listened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We’re appalled when those ‘above’ us don’t share - but there’s always somebody below, too, says director Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>When Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia began shooting his latest film in Bilbao almost two years ago, the Spanish director felt the themes of his low-budget, dystopian horror feature would be sufficiently universal to resonate with audiences around the world. Today, however, many are claiming that El Hoyo – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/20/the-platform-review-fiendish-netflix-thriller-about-a-gory-battle-for-food">known in English as The Platform</a> – is the perfect parable for life in the time of the coronavirus and a visceral investigation of how a crisis can expose not only the stratification of human society but also the immutable strands of selfishness coded into our DNA.</p><p>The parallels are certainly not hard to find. The Platform is set in a forbidding “vertical self-management centre” – a soaring series of concrete cells stacked one on top of the other, each holding two inmates. Every day, the eponymous platform, stacked with a lavish but finite supply of food and drink, descends, level by level.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/16/what-netflixs-the-platform-tells-us-about-humanity-in-the-coronavirus-era">Continue reading...</a>

I am standing in front of the open fridge, surveying the contents, which sprawl across each other like donated shoes at a jumble sale. Plates of leftovers perch on top of each other, a function of catering each night as if, come the morning, an invading army will be pillaging the land. I spot a couple of cooked sausages, the cheap ones made with less loin, and more nostril, lip and nipple because one of my family members likes those and right now, we all get what we damn well like. I tear off a solid inch of cold, cheap fried sausage. I pop it into my mouth, slam the fridge door shut and move on. Nothing to see here.

## Animals Farmed: pig virus, wildlife trade in China, and the 'poultry capital' of Wales

<p>Welcome to our monthly roundup of the biggest issues in farming and food production, with must-read reports from around the web</p><p><strong>Pigs and poultry are likely to be safe from Covid-19,</strong> <a href="http://www.pig-world.co.uk/news/studies-show-pigs-and-poultry-are-not-susceptible-to-covid-19.html">according</a> to German scientists, whose study showed that while fruit bats and ferrets were susceptible to infection, pigs and chickens were not. Coronaviruses have devastated farm animals in the past. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554686">SADS-CoV</a>) killed <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/new-coronavirus-emerges-bats-china-devastates-young-swine">nearly 25,000 piglets</a> in China in 2016–17. <br /><br />A new outbreak of African swine fever (ASF), a highly contagious virus fatal to pigs, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/08/african-swine-fever-outbreak-reported-in-western-poland">been reported</a> on a farm in Poland close to the German border. The German states of Brandenburg and Saxony have both recently<strong> built fences along the border with Poland to keep out wild boars infected</strong> with ASF. Meanwhile, in China authorities have launched a 60-day campaign to crack down on improper or illegal transportation of pigs to reduce ASF transmission. The outbreak in the country has already wiped out 40% of its pig population.<br /><br />MEPs and campaigners have <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/meps-join-call-for-ban-on-live-animal-transport-amid-covid-19-border-delays/">called on the EU to ban</a> live exports<strong> to reduce the spread of zoonotic disease</strong>. The European Food Safety Authority <a href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2011.1966">has said</a> in the past that the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/two-billion-and-rising-the-global-trade-in-live-animals-in-eight-charts">live export trade</a> is a potential risk to public health. It said stresses associated with handling and transport may cause latent infections to proceed to clinical disease. These animals may infect others and in many cases (such as salmonellosis) would also increase the risk to public health.<br /><br />A group of 40 NGOs <a href="https://www.ciwf.org.uk/media/7439834/joint-letter-eu-fpc_covid_f2fdocx.pdf?utm_campaign=factoryfarming&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=ciwf">have also written</a> to the EU to demand an <strong>overhaul of its food and farming system post Covid-19</strong>. The pandemic had “brought to light some of the dysfunctions of our current globalised and unsustainable food systems, including the link between the increased emergence of zoonoses and intensive animal farming”, they said. The letter also urged the EU not to delay the launch of its new <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/agriculture-food/news/leak-eus-farm-to-fork-strategy-will-be-based-on-five-key-targets/">Farm to Fork strategy</a> any later than this month.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/animals-farmed/2020/apr/16/animals-farmed-pig-virus-wildlife-trade-in-china-and-the-poultry-capital-of-wales">Continue reading...</a>
