Final Fantasy 7 Remake reinvents the combat systems of the 1997 original. Instead of a turn-based, menu-filled approach to fights, FF7 Remake goes the action-RPG route, allowing you to run around the battlefield, dodge blows, block incoming attacks, and unleash your own combos. But in addition to familiar hack-and-slash gameplay, the remake also mixes in elements of the original, allowing you to cast spells, give your teammates menu-based orders, or take direct control of other members of your party at any time.

The result is a combat system that's a mix of twitch attacks and strategic planning, where each character has unique abilities and actions, and using your whole party together is the only way to be effective. FF7 Remake will throw some tough battles at you throughout the game, including some intense, multi-stage boss fights that will require all of your skills to make you through. We've compiled a series of tips to help you excel at Final Fantasy 7 Remake's combat and claim victory against anything the game throws your way.

Check out the video above, which will help you use each character effectively, outfit your squad, and tackle any situation.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake is out now and fans of the series are excited to revisit the world of Midgar. But what about newcomers? Here's why you should check out FF7 Remake, especially if you're unfamiliar with the series.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a huge event for fans of Square Enix's RPG series and anybody who got lost in the game's world 23 years ago. If you missed the boat back in 1997 or if JRPGs like Final Fantasy aren't your thing, though, you might be wondering what all the fuss is about. FF7's world is a bit confusing to begin with, and that's before you add all the additional caveats that come with the Remake--like the fact that it only covers a fraction of the original FF7 story.

If you're bewildered by Final Fantasy 7 Remake and all the information swirling around it, the video above is for you. We're laying out why you should care about FF7 Remake, how it relates to the original game, and what's changed. Most importantly, though, is why you should care about FF7 Remake. Given that our review awarded the game one of GameSpot's rare 10 out of 10s, we definitely think you should.

FF7 Remake is a good entry point for the Final Fantasy curious, whether you're new to the franchise or just new to FF7. The original is a classic and the Remake is in a class of its own, but if you never experienced it for yourself, we're here to tell you why.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake greatly expands on the story of the original FF7, adding a huge amount of character development and worldbuilding to the tale Square first told back in 1997. Revisiting the world of Midgar has turned out to be pretty incredible. At GameSpot, we sat down to talk about the experience of returning to FF7 23 years later and seeing a fresh take on the world.

But FF7 Remake doesn't just retell the story or add additional context. It makes some changes, too. Our conversations is a spoiler-filled rundown of everything Final Fantasy 7, from the changes to the game's battle system to the liberties it takes with the story--and where those might lead in future installments. We even take some time to discuss how the remake reworks FF7's classic soundtrack into something even more incredible.

And of course, we eventually get to the ending of Final Fantasy 7 Remake, where the game makes its biggest diversions from the original. The ending leaves a lot of questions, and we've got some speculation as to what it all means and where it's all going. Check out our discussion, and leave your own opinions, theories, and ideas about Final Fantasy 7 Remake in the comments.
