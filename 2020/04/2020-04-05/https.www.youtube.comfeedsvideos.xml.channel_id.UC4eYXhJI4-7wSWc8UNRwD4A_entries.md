This performance was recorded on February 26, 2020. We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They’re recorded by the artists in their home. It’s the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Watch Allen Stone play "American Privilege", "Give You Blue", "Brown Eyed Lover" and "Consider Me" at the Tiny Desk.

March 30, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- I can't recall an artist so committed to making their Tiny Desk concert memorable. I'd met with Allen Stone weeks prior to go over priorities, expectations and the usual formalities, but this was different. His questions about how to prepare for the Tiny Desk signaled to me that he held this platform in the highest regard and that this wasn't just any appearance.

The Washington state native has a voice that we simply don't come across often. The old saying goes, "He could sing the phone book and make it sound good." His three graceful background singers and piano player provided the perfect compliment, but this set proved undoubtedly that his voice belongs right up front. He's been releasing music for more than a decade and touring the world, but last year's Building Balance is his best yet and he graced the desk with some of my favorites from the LP.

Before he rolled into a trilogy of Building Balance songs dedicated to his wife (who he said he's "face first in love" with), the set opened with the jarring "American Privilege," which addresses his internal guilt about everything from materialism to being born white. Between songs, he couldn't contain his affinity for the Tiny Desk and his appreciation for the moment. "It's a breath of fresh air for me that this is the way people want to hear music."

SET LIST
"American Privilege"
"Give You Blue"
"Brown Eyed Lover"
"Consider Me"

We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Stephen Thompson | January 3, 2010

The Mountain Goats' John Darnielle keeps getting quieter, as his raw early bedroom recordings and bare-knuckle anthems continue to make way for polished ballads that whisper, seethe and mourn. The recent The Life of the World to Come at first feels strangely timid, but as its crushingly sad words sink in ("I am a flightless bird / There'll be no more after me," and so on), it hits slowly but deeply — less a punch than a gnawing ache.

In person, Darnielle's twitchy, nervous energy serves his fearless songwriting well: He exudes gentility and good humor in conversation, but his performances are utterly committed, with intensity that infuses his screams and whispers alike. In this solo Tiny Desk Concert, his four songs fit nearly into distinct categories: new and quiet ("Hebrews 11:40"), new and loud ("Psalms 40:2"), old and quiet ("Color in Your Cheeks," from All Hail West Texas), and old and loud ("Going to Georgia," from Zopilote Machine). It's no surprise that all four approaches serve him well.

Also, it should be noted that Darnielle drew a large and admiring crowd for this show, even though it appears in the video that it was attended exclusively by a photographer and the giant blond head of Lars Gotrich. Trust me: We wouldn't have missed this one for anything.

Set List
"Color in Your Cheeks"
"Hebrews 11:40"
"Psalms 40:2"
"Going to Georgia"
