## Stoners cheered when Canada legalised cannabis. How did it go so wrong?

<p>Growers have gone bust, and the black market is still thriving</p><p>The lights shone more brightly than anything I’d ever seen. One million blinding watts strafed across the leaves of countless cannabis plants that peeled off in neat rows in every direction. The warehouse was as pristine as a pharmaceutical facility, and as we strode around in crisp white nylon overalls and box-fresh wellies, the atmosphere was surreal – interstellar, almost: – it felt as if we were on a mission to Mars. It was definitely a glimpse of the future.</p><p>It was 2017 and I had been invited to visit this legal medical cannabis “grow” in the town of Gatineau, near Ottawa. I was in Canada after writing a paper for the drug-law reform thinktank <a href="https://volteface.me/" title="">Volteface</a>, proposing an online-only, legal cannabis market in the UK as a way to break the logjam between the UK’s two million cannabis smokers and those who fear legalisation. I was meeting with Canadian police and politicians to hear more about that country’s plans to completely legalise cannabis the following year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/05/stoners-cheered-when-canada-legalised-cannabis-how-did-it-all-go-wrong">Continue reading...</a>

## Walk on by: why do we ignore bad behaviour?

<p>It’s a familiar scenario: a packed train or bus, an unpleasant loudmouth picking on a lone passenger... and nobody does anything. What drives us to look away – and can we change?</p><p>What makes a hero? According to a popular meme going around at the moment, intentions matter more than actions. “Your grandparents were called to war,” it says. “You’re being called to sit on the couch.” In a way, sitting around and doing nothing is a new type of heroism, because going out and living life as normal makes you a passive bystander to a global threat. But in ordinary times, the difference between a hero and a bystander is far more clear-cut. What makes some of us the former, and some of us the latter?</p><p>As she was boarding the tube in London on an otherwise ordinary Friday morning last November, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/nov/23/man-arrested-after-jewish-children-were-targeted-on-the-tube" title="">Asma Shuweikh</a> felt a man rush past her. He made a beeline for an orthodox Jewish family sitting by the doors– a father and two sons in kippah. Brandishing a bible, the man began to hurl antisemitic abuse at the family; as Shuweikh stood in shocked silence, she noticed he had highlighted passages in his book. When the man turned his attention to the children, she decided she could not remain silent any longer: it was time to speak up. In a video that subsequently went viral on social media, the 36-year-old can be seen calmly telling the aggressor: “Come on, man, there’s children here… You’re on public transport.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/05/walk-on-by-why-do-we-ignore-bad-behaviour-">Continue reading...</a>

One views it as a supreme exercise in composition, like an abstract painting: the photograph is divided into three vertical sections – road, buildings and rooftop – each delineated by contrasts in sunlight and shadow. The image is a photographic equivalent of the modernist architecture it celebrates, dwelling on concrete geometries.</p><p>In the other way of seeing, the eye fixes on the four figures on the roof. The cityscape below and its teeming traffic becomes a vertiginous backdrop to their curious, elongated silhouettes. The four are cast in an apparently conspiratorial drama that demands to be understood. What is their purpose up there? Why are three of the figures in step behind the man ahead? The shot looks like a still from a film – but the tone is elusive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/05/the-big-picture-rene-burri-shadows-of-doubt">Continue reading...</a>

Then it is just a question on arrival of forgetting about the usual sightseeing and getting lost in the labyrinth of narrow alleyways.

The new ‘Cbils’ scheme is much improved. But many of its shortcomings could have been identified at the start<p>Banks are wicked and Rishi Sunak walks on water. That, at least, was the narrative that prevailed until the end of last week. The dashing new chancellor, the cabinet star of the coronavirus moment, had assembled the Treasury’s armoury to provide lending to British businesses on unprecedented scale. It was only the damn banks that were stopping the cash reaching intended recipients.</p><p>This storyline now looks wrong. Sunak and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans" title="">the Treasury’s “further action”, </a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/02/uk-banks-banned-from-requesting-personal-guarantees-for-loans" title="">announced on Thursday night</a> to support struggling British firms, was not a mere tweak.

<p>It used to be video games and street food, but now the comedian relishes a day without routine</p><p><strong>Are you up early?</strong> All days feel the same when you are a comedian. I’m up at 9am if I’m feeling hard-working. If I didn’t set an alarm I think I’d sleep forever. And that’s how I’d die.</p><p><strong>A day out? </strong>I prefer not to leave the house – I’m a homebody, really. When you work in the arts you can convince yourself that watching TV is professional development. My favourite Sundays are the ones spent recovering from an intense Saturday night.

My husband joined me.</em></p><p><em>I realised that I am an alcoholic. I asked my husband not to drink in the house for a while, or to wait until after I was in bed. But he won’t stop on the basis I am the problem drinker and not him. He says I am being a control freak and setting out unacceptable rules. Recently, he persuaded me to have a glass of wine; I drank a bottle and had the worst hangover the following day.
