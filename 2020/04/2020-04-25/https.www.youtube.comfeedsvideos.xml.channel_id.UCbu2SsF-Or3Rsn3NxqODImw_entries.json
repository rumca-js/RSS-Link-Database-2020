This time, they want to lock their animal \"friends\" into cages. Because that's a perfectly normal thing a sane person would do in Animal Crossing: New Horizons.\n\nIn the video above, Rob Handlery and Jake Dekker continue their villainous undertaking to craft the most vile villager they can. Not content with simply rounding everyone up, the two decide to go a step further and turn their victims' prison into an elaborate maze that's riddled with pitfalls. It looks exactly as diabolical as it sounds.\n\nThere's plenty of other activities to do in New Horizons if you don't want to be mean to your neighbors. The game's latest limited-time event has begun, attracting the flower bush-selling Leif to your island. He's not the only new visitor either, as Redd has returned from previous games in order to sell you some new art. Take advantage of both sellers to pretty up your island--you never know when you might need to host a celebrity who wants to take advantage of your turnip prices.\n\n#VileVillager #AnimalCrossing #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yEhZi9AyhDM", "date_published": "2020-04-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Making A Real Life RPG And KK Slider Covers | Good News Gaming", "description": "This week on Good News Gaming, we take a look at some of the incredible things people are doing from home while socially distancing themselves.

Jean-Luc talks about a few major things he\u2019d like to see in it that could improve an already excellent game.\n\nWhat could a Resident Evil 4 remake look like? This particular question has been on the minds of Resident Evil fans ever since a report recently surfaced saying that Capcom is planning on remaking Resident Evil 4. Will it be a faithful recreation in the RE Engine or will Capcom follow in the footsteps of its most recent remakes and make larger changes to the game? Heck, does it even need to be changed?\n\nIn the video above, Jean-Luc tackles all these questions. While Resident Evil 4 remains  fantastic, no game is without flaws and refinements can always be made to better the experience. He discusses how the near-universally disliked Ashley could be improved, how the second half could be made even stronger, and how Capcom could go about handling preserving the campy dialogue that made the game so endearing.\n\nWhile it still isn\u2019t officially confirmed whether Capcom is planning on remaking Resident Evil 4, the possibility of us seeing one in the near future seems more likely than ever before. Capcom had great success in the past with the re-release of Resident Evil 1 remake, as well as the recently released Resident Evil 2 and 3 remakes. You can check out our reviews for the latter two games over on GameSpot.com or on our YouTube channel.\n\n#RE4Remake #ResidentEvil #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_ghuXUzMxI", "date_published": "2020-04-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
