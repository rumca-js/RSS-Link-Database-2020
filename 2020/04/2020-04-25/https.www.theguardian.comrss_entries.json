In her memoir, his daughter recalls returning to her childhood home<br /></p><p>In December 2009, Shelley Klein left her home in the fishing village of Port Isaac, Cornwall, and set off for the house in the Scottish Borders where she had grown up. The 450-mile journey was ostensibly the result of her recent decision to move in with her elderly, widowed father (alone of her siblings, she was able to to do this, being single and self-employed). But in truth it wasn\u2019t the only reason; another, almost equally powerful force was also in play. In the three decades since she\u2019d last lived there, Klein had never been able fully to shake off the spell cast by High Sunderland, the house in question. Wherever she went, whatever she did, it was always at the back of her mind, to the point where she wondered whether her feelings for it were entirely rational. Can a house be loved as a person is? Perhaps not. All she knew was that it was a part of her, just as it was a part of her father.</p><p>Adults who return home often revert to being teenagers \u2013 we\u2019ve all done it, even in the course only of a long weekend \u2013 and our parents, too, tend to talk to us just as they always did once we\u2019re over the threshold. In the first moments after her arrival at High Sunderland, Shelley drank in its old, familiar smells: paprika, woodsmoke, freshly ground coffee. But the mood didn\u2019t last long. Carrying her possessions from van to house, her father was horrified to see among them a Victorian chair \u2013 a piece of furniture he unhesitatingly deemed to be \u201cghastly\u201d. Nor was he pleased to see her arranging a collection of potted herbs on the kitchen windowsill. Couldn\u2019t she put them elsewhere? For instance, in her bedroom. Irritated, Shelley asked what he had against them. \u201cThey\u2019re messy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey spoil the line of the house.\u201d In his eyes, only chives, a pleasingly \u201cvertical\u201d plant, could ever be even vaguely acceptable as interior decoration.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/25/people-fell-under-its-spell-shelley-klein-on-growing-up-in-one-of-britains-finest-modernist-houses\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/25/people-fell-under-its-spell-shelley-klein-on-growing-up-in-one-of-britains-finest-modernist-houses", "date_published": "2020-04-25 13:00:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Roisin Conaty: \u2018Standup is a confidence game.

But when putting the novel\u2019s most intimate scenes between Marianne and Connell on screen, what was once a matter of lines on the page becomes minutes of closeups on flushed and sweaty skin.</p><p>Every sex scene in the BBC\u2019s much-anticipated adaptation, starting on Sunday, even the clumsiest teenage fumblings \u2013 a bra getting stuck over Marianne\u2019s head, Connell tripping over his trousers \u2013 was carefully choreographed by Ita O\u2019Brien, an \u201cintimacy coordinator\u201d who makes sure actors are comfortable while filming rumpy pumpy. Over the last decade, intimacy coordinators have become more commonplace on theatre, film and TV sets, particularly in the aftermath of Harvey Weinstein\u2019s fall. Suddenly, producers and directors are falling over themselves to hire someone like O\u2019Brien, who has worked on everything from Netflix\u2019s Sex Education to HBO\u2019s Watchmen and BBC\u2019s Gangs of London.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/normal-people-intimacy-coordinator-works-sally-rooney-sex-scenes\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/25/normal-people-intimacy-coordinator-works-sally-rooney-sex-scenes", "date_published": "2020-04-25 06:00:38+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Outcry as rich Saint-Tropez residents 'given coronavirus tests'", "description": "<p>Neighbourhood of Les Parcs de Saint Tropez reportedly screened as local hospital staff do without</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>On the sunny C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, playground of the rich and famous, lockdown life in Les Parcs de Saint Tropez is good.</p><p>The Mediterranean \u2013 accessed via a private beach \u2013 is a little cool this time of year, but the luxury mansions and ch\u00e2teau here on the Cap Saint Pierre have swimming pools and if the temperature drops below 70F, as it did briefly this week, there is always the tennis courts or vast landscaped gardens.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/outcry-as-rich-saint-tropez-residents-given-coronavirus-tests\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/outcry-as-rich-saint-tropez-residents-given-coronavirus-tests", "date_published": "2020-04-25 06:00:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus live news: Brazil\u2019s health system on verge of collapse, medics warn", "description": "<p>Leader of US group peddling bleach as \u2018miracle\u2019 cure wrote to Trump before remarks; Australia and New Zealand mark Anzac Day from driveways</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-leader-group-peddling-bleach-cure-lobbied-trump-coronavirus\">Leader of group peddling bleach as \u2018cure\u2019 wrote to Trump this week</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/sweden-queries-basis-of-lockdowns-as-germany-keeps-its-guard-up\">Global report: Sweden queries lockdowns as Germany keeps guard up</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-24-april\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/24/coronavirus-us-live-news-trump-cuomo-georgia-cases-latest\">US coronavirus updates \u2013 live</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-25T05:58:38.800Z\">6.58am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>Boris Johnson is expected to return to work soon after his recovery from Covid-19, as pressure mounts on his government to explain how to get Britain out of lockdown.</p><p>Johnson, 55, has been recuperating at the British prime ministerial retreat, Chequers, outside London since his release from hospital on 12 April.</p><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-25T05:40:44.272Z\">6.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>Australia\u2019s national sporting codes - like most in the world - have been shut down by the pandemic, but its national rugby league competition is determined to come back as soon as possible. </p><p>There\u2019s been talk of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/nrl-island-recipe-for-ruin-or-a-world-leading-game-changer\">staging a televised competition on an island</a>, or another dedicated site cut off from the outside world.
