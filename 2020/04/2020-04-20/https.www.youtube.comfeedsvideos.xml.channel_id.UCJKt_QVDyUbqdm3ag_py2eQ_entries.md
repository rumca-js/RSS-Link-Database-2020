3 tracks made with Virgill's AmigaKlang modular synth software. These were some of the Revision 2020 oldskool music compo entries. All instruments are synthetic of course (no prerecorded samples). Trivia: I had to switch off ACA1233n/40 accelerator on my A1200 to get the executables play the audio correctly. This upload is intended for headphones only.
