## With sport frozen in time we need to find joy in the journey, not the destination | Jonathan Liew

<p>Even now we are finding it impossible to let go of sport, but maybe it is time to stop hoping for conventional endings</p><p>I’ve always been vaguely puzzled by the story of the dinosaurs. Not what happened, but why we tell it, and in particular why we tell it to children at such an early stage in their formation. Let’s just try to picture things from the child’s perspective for a second. First, you lovingly render this idyllic prehistoric landscape. Next, you populate it with all sorts of strange and fantastical characters. Stampeding triceratops. Big, clumsy diplodocus. Sleepy stegosaurus. Squawking pterodactyl. The mighty, ravenous tyrannosaurus rex.</p><p>Then on the final page, just as the child is beginning to grow an emotional affinity to these beasts, to wonder how they might develop or interact with each other, you destroy the whole planet with a giant meteorite. Entirely without warning, and for no reason at all, every last dinosaur dies: The End. Or worse, the news has to be broken by a sheepish parent as a sort of appalling “Where Are They Now?” epilogue. What lesson, then, is the child supposed to derive from all this? That nothing lasts forever? That everything you hold dear is liable to be incinerated in a giant cosmic fireball at any given moment? Or, conversely, are we to disregard the distressing denouement altogether, and celebrate the fact that these magnificent monsters walked the earth in the first place?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/with-sport-frozen-in-time-we-need-to-find-joy-in-the-journey-not-the-destination">Continue reading...</a>

The former head of a huge cocaine smuggling operation, Wright was sentenced to a 30-year term and has now been let out on licence, having served half of it, and is reportedly living in a bail hostel.<br /><br />Wright exerted a baleful influence on horse racing in the 1980s and 90s, when officials believed he had corrupted a large number of jockeys, fixed races and organised the doping of horses.

<p>Ad-Rock and Mike D host a convivial trip down memory lane in this filmed record of a live show staged in tribute to third member Adam Yauch<strong><br /></strong></p><p>The release of this documentary coincides with #MeAt20, a heart-twisting craze on social media for posting pictures of yourself at 20 years old. Middle-aged people’s timelines are speckled with funny, sweet and sometimes unbearably sad images of themselves in unlined, unformed youth, doing goofy things in milky analogue pictures from back when you had 12 or 24 exposures on your roll-film camera and getting them developed at Boots was a pricey business. That’s what I thought of while watching this engaging, oddly moving film from Spike Jonze: a record of the live stage show he devised at the Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, in tribute to white hip-hop stars and tongue-in-cheek party-libertarian activists <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/beastie-boys">the Beastie Boys</a>. It is presented by the two surviving members, Adam Horovitz and Michael Diamond, in tribute to the third member, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/05/adam-yauch">Adam Yauch</a>, who died of cancer in 2012. Jonze is reuniting with the band after having directed a string of their music videos, including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE">the crime-TV spoof for their single Sabotage</a> in 1994.</p><p>Horovitz and Diamond amble on stage, apparently dressed head-to-toe in Gap, and appear for all the world to be about to unveil the iPhone 4S, although actually their jokey anecdotalism makes the show in some ways like the regional tours once presented by George Best and Rodney Marsh. With amiably rehearsed back-and-forth banter, they introduce the embarrassing photos and excruciating TV clips that are shown on a big screen. And the effect of seeing them juxtaposed with the plump-faced frizzy-haired imps of 1986 is startling and bizarre. In the present day, the advancing years seem to have boiled away the badass attitude, leaving behind the quirky humour.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/20/beastie-boys-story-review-spike-jonze-apple-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There will be no going back to ‘normal’. Our cherished concept of work is increasingly meaningless – the future belongs to those who understand the arts of life</p><p>The infantilising of the people by our leaders is horribly revealing of the English psyche. “Jam tomorrow and jam yesterday – but never jam today.” Only it is not jam in this case, it is life-saving personal protective equipment. I specify “English” because Nicola Sturgeon addresses her nation as grownups and Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel pay their people the same respect. Now, armed with the knowledge that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings">our prime minister bunked off Cobra meetings</a> as this crisis unfolded, we are being told nothing can really be decided until he comes back from his convalescence. So we are stuck with ministers in supply teacher mode.</p><p>Everything has changed and we need to prepare for the new normal. Lockdown isn’t ending any time soon. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/25/there-is-no-trade-off-between-the-economy-and-health">There is no simple choice between saving lives and saving the economy</a>; the two are intertwined. There is no going back to BC: before corona. Some of us knew this from day one, others are still in denial. There is the unmistakable feeling that a monumental shift in how we live is coming, one way or another, a shift that has long been latent. Those of us in rich countries have been intent on pushing the climate emergency into the future, but now our money won’t save us. Our vulnerability just might. But this requires humility. The idea that Boris Johnson will “bounce back” into his job is as ludicrous as thinking the economy will “bounce back”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/20/the-way-we-once-lived-is-now-redundant-we-need-to-reinvent-ourselves">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘When I’m asked why it’s so popular, I always say the same thing: it’s cheaper than antidepressants’ </p><p>The original poster was part of a trio designed during the second world war by the Ministry of Information.

I think that’s why Keep Calm was held back and never publicly displayed, and the bulk of copies either pulped or lost.

<p>When the US president’s daughter suggested people try making a camel or goose with hand shadows, she was greeted instead with unicorns made from middle fingers</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>Ivanka Trump.</p><p><strong>Age:</strong> 38.<br /><br /><strong>Appearance: </strong>Hollywood wannabe.<br /><br /><strong>Role: </strong>First daughter and senior adviser to the US president.<strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>What does she advise on?</strong> “Job creation, economic empowerment, workforce development and entrepreneurship,” according to her <a href="https://twitter.com/IvankaTrump?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Twitter bio</a>.<br /><br /><strong>So what’s her advice to </strong><strong>American people suffering under the strain of a global pandemic and economic meltdown? </strong>“Looking for a Saturday-night activity? Try making shadow puppets from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12962/12962-h/12962-h.htm">Henry Bursill’s</a> recently unearthed 1860s book of engraving.” <br /><br /><strong>Come again?</strong> You know, that thing where you hold your hand up in front of a light and make a shadow image on the wall of an animal. Ivanka helpfully supplied images of a goose, goat, greyhound and camel to get people started.<br /><br /><strong>How did it go down?</strong> Let’s say it didn’t meet with universal enthusiasm. Quite a few of the twitterati responded with a shadow puppet of a unicorn.<br /><br /><strong>How is that made?</strong> By putting your hand in front of the light, making a fist and raising your middle finger.<br /><br /><strong>I take it Bursill offers no illustration of the unicorn. </strong>None that I can see.<br /><strong><br />Any other responses?</strong> Mention of puppets put quite a few people in mind of the relationship between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, with the former shown as a ventriloquist’s dummy. Others said Ivanka should concentrate on the pandemic, with one person – in a nod to her fashion retailing background – suggesting she start producing designer body bags.<br /><br /><strong>A little over the top?</strong> It hasn’t helped that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/ivanka-trump-defies-social-distancing-to-celebrate-passover-at-golf-club">she and her husband Jared Kushner</a>, having told people to stay at home, defied the lockdown earlier this month to travel with their three children from Washington DC to celebrate Passover at her <a href="https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/16/coronavirus-ivanka-trump-takes-heat-new-jersey-passover-trip/5145118002/">“family home”</a>, the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey – a round trip of more than 400 miles. <br /><br /><strong>Is Ivanka Jewish?</strong> She <a href="https://people.com/celebrity/ivanka-trump-converts-to-judaism-for-fianc/">converted</a> when she married Kushner in 2009.<br /><br /><strong>Creepy filial fact:</strong> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-elections/donald-trump-ivanka-trump-creepiest-most-unsettling-comments-a-roundup-a7353876.html">Donald Trump</a> once said that if Ivanka wasn’t his daughter, he would be dating her. <br /><br /><strong>Ugh!

<p>If you need somewhere to focus your attention, this immersive, exhilarating series will reward you handsomely for your time</p><p>With the fifth season finale of the best show on TV coming to UK screens on Tuesday, there has never been a better time to get invested in the brilliant <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan">Better Call Saul</a> (<a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80021955">Netflix</a>). Before lockdown, a slow-burning prequel to an intense 21st-century US classic – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/breaking-bad">Breaking Bad</a> – might have felt like a heavy commitment. But if you are looking for somewhere to focus your feeling of simmering dread as lockdown stretches ahead, this immersive, exhilarating television comes highly recommended. It is even more exciting and enriching than the show it is leading us towards.</p><p>Watching Better Call Saul works particularly well in these extraordinary times because of its novelistic qualities. It also requires patience (which feels fitting, given the state of the world), but that patience reaps rewards. It tells us the tragic, funny story of an unravelling, comedic everyman – the somehow-always-adorable Jimmy McGill – who becomes the flashy, trashy lawyer Saul Goodman. Even though the decision to remake himself sends him spiralling him towards a world of terrifying drug lords, it is the wider scope of Jimmy’s vivid world that keeps us returning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2020/apr/20/loved-breaking-bad-better-call-saul-is-just-what-you-need-in-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Will the coronavirus pandemic return us to more traditional and accepting, attitudes towards dying – or reinforce our attempts to prolong life? </p><p>The modern world has been shaped by the belief that humans can outsmart and defeat death. That was a revolutionary new attitude. For most of history, humans meekly submitted to death. Up to the late modern age, most religions and ideologies saw death not only as our inevitable fate, but as the main source of meaning in life. The most important events of human existence happened after you exhaled your last breath. Only then did you come to learn the true secrets of life. Only then did you gain eternal salvation, or suffer everlasting damnation. In a world without death – and therefore without heaven, hell or reincarnation – religions such as Christianity, Islam and Hinduism would have made no sense. For most of history the best human minds were busy giving meaning to death, not trying to defeat it.</p><p><em>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview26">Epic of Gilgamesh</a></em>, the myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, the Bible, the Qur’an, the Vedas, and countless other sacred books and tales patiently explained to distressed humans that we die because God decreed it, or the Cosmos, or Mother Nature, and we had better accept that destiny with humility and grace. Perhaps someday God would abolish death through a grand metaphysical gesture such as Christ’s second coming.

Few suspected the cult curio had potential as a global giga-franchise. They reckoned without the Simon Cowellification of cookery TV.</p><p>In 2005, mere months after The X Factor launched, rights to the amateur cook-off were snapped up by Elisabeth Murdoch’s Shine TV.

I thought: ‘Wow, she’s fit!’” Although she left an impression on him, Kärri admits she was too busy to notice Mark. “I was totally focused on work at the time,” she laughs.</p><p>Over the next few months, the pair met regularly for drinks and became friends. “We were both playing the field on Tinder,” says Mark. “There was an attraction, but I had a strict policy on not dating people I worked with, so it felt like we could be really open with each other.” Kärri had come out of a long-term relationship and wasn’t looking for anything serious. “I was making the most of the dating scene and my independence,” she explains. In spring 2015, she started a new adventure. “I loved sailing, so I decided I was going to take part in the Clipper Round the World yacht race.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/20/mark-collected-all-the-emails-from-when-i-was-at-sea">Continue reading...</a>

It is reasonable to argue that since lessons will not reduce our immediate suffering, we should learn them once we’re through this. But the vulnerability that makes the present so painful is exactly why some discussions cannot wait. The suffering we stand to reduce or increase by the threads of action that we begin to unwind now could be magnitudes of what we’re currently experiencing.</p><p>Imagine that while your country practised social distancing, your neighbouring country responded to Covid-19 by packing citizens into gymnasiums by the tens of thousands. Imagine if, in addition, they instituted genetic and pharmaceutical interventions that helped their citizens maintain productivity under such adverse conditions, even though this had the unfortunate side effect of devastating their immune systems. And to complete this dystopian vision, imagine if your neighbours simultaneously reduced their number of doctors tenfold. Such actions would radically increase death rates not only within their country, but yours. Pathogens do not respect national boundaries.

<p>Asparagus souffle, mushroom tagliatelle, baked cheese croissants, apricot and lemon curd cake – seven delicious recipes that are as good as gold</p><p>I long to break into the freckled shell of a boiled egg and lift its snow white and deep orange heart with a teaspoon. I even find myself gazing at a fluffy omelette, its baveuse interior oozing out as the fork goes in. But alas, there is no cheque large enough to tempt me to eat an egg. Whether boiled, scrambled, poached or fried, the egg has always been my culinary bête noir. I like my oeufs well and truly hidden. Custard, cake, meringue or mayonnaise are among my favourite things to eat, as is a souffle, a creme caramel or a mousse, but the egg must always be in total disguise. I have been like this all my life and I reluctantly admit that, at this age, my aversion is unlikely to change.</p><p>But I don’t write this column for myself, I write it for you and, let’s be honest, most sensible people do find the egg one of the most indispensable ingredients in the kitchen. So eggs it is, cheap and as cheerful as a sunny spring morning. In the recipes that follow there are crisp golden croissants cooked in the style of eggy bread; eggs briefly baked with pink prawns and scarlet chillies, there are egg whites in a souffle and yolks in a peppercorn-spiked mayonnaise. I have also made a tender loaf cake with dried apricots and homemade lemon curd, and a garlic-flecked tangle of tagliatelle. Who knows, I may eat that boiled egg yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/20/nigel-slater-easy-egg-recipes-souffle-tagliatelle-cheese-croissants">Continue reading...</a>
