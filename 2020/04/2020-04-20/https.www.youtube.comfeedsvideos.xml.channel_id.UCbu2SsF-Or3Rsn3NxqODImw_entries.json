Starting that day, Leif the sloth will make periodic visits to your plaza to sell seeds for flowers and shrubs, the latter being new to the game. Redd will also dock his boat at your private beach to sell furniture and art. And yes, that art can be donated to the museum's new art wing.\n\nThe game's next named event is Nature Day, which adds special Nook Miles+ objectives for tending to your trees, flowers, and new shrubs. The event runs from April 23 - May 4, as detailed in the video above.\n\nThis is one of several upcoming events headed to the game in the near future. May Day, which includes island tours not available via Nook Miles tickets, will overlap with Nature Day by a bit. International Museum Day and Wedding Season will follow after that.\n\n#AnimalCrossing #NatureDay #GameSpot", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ryVcfiC5qQ", "date_published": "2020-04-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "New Cyberpunk 2077 Xbox One X Revealed", "description": "Microsoft announced its last ever Limited Edition Xbox One X console for CD Projekt Red\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077, Infinity Ward teases a Modern Warfare sequel, and Fortnite\u2019s Astronomical event locks in its headliner. \n\nWelcome to your GameSpot daily news round-up of the biggest gaming stories.
