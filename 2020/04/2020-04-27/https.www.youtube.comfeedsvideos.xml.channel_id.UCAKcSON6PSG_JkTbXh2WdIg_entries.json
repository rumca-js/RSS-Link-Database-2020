The second part, A Different Kind of Human (Step 2) was released in June, 2019. While in town for a show in the First Avenue Mainroom in 2019, Aurora \u2014 along with bandmates Silja Sol, Fredrik Vogsborg and Magnus Skylstad \u2014 stopped at The Current for a session hosted by Mac Wilson.\n\nAurora is based in Bergen, a city on Norway's west coast that Aurora says is home to a thriving artistic community. \"It is a very good place to become a musician or a producer or artist,\" she explains. \"We're all very close; we all know each other and support each other. \u2026 There's a lot of indie music coming out from Bergen. It's a very good community; we're very lucky.\"\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n\n\"Animal\"\n\"Churchyard\"\n\"It Happened Quiet\"\n\nThe second and third songs is from Aurora's 2018 album, Infections of a Different Kind (Step 1); the first song is from Aurora's next album A Different Kind of Human (Step 2), released in 2019.
