Fortnite has pulled out all the bells and whistles with its latest collaborative effort with Travis Scott. The popular artist has a psychedelic display that occurs live in game and we captured the entire event in this gameplay clip. Check it out!

Fortnite developer Epic Games and rapper Travis Scott teamed up to host a special Astronomical concert in the popular battle royale game this week. While this isn't the first time a concert has been held in the game, it's certainly the most elaborate and surreal one to date, featuring a giant digital likeness of the rapper dancing around the island as the environment morphed according to the song.

There are a few more showings of the Astronomical concert planned for Saturday, April 25, so you still have a chance to log in and watch it unfold in the game. If you're not able to catch it live, however, we've captured the entire concert in the video above.

Tying into the Astronomical concert is a special, limited-time set of challenges to complete, which will unlock more Travis Scott cosmetics. One of the challenges asks you to bounce off of giant inflatable Astro heads. If you need help finding those, be sure to check out our Fortnite Astro heads location guide.

Season 2 of Fortnite Chapter 2 has been extended into early June, with Season 3 of the game now planned to kick off on June 4. That means you still have a few more weeks to complete any challenges you may have missed from earlier in the season. You can find maps and guides to help you finish those in our Fortnite Season 2 challenges roundup.
