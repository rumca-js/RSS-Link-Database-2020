American televangelist Kenneth Copeland, who recently claimed that the coronavirus pandemic will be “over much sooner you think”, has summoned the “wind of God” to destroy the novel coronavirus during a recent sermon.

Before blowing at the camera, he said: ”I blow the wind of God on you. You are destroyed forever, and you’ll never be back. Thank you, God. Let it happen. Cause it to happen.”

Leading a chant surrounded by members of his church and preaching to an empty room, he called out: “Wind, almighty, strong, south wind, Heat: Burn this thing, in the name of Jesus. I say, you bow your knees. You fall on your face.”

In a sermon last month, the pastor “executed judgment” on Covid-19, which he declared ”finished” and “over” and made the US ”healed and well again.”
