The title comes from the callous (but accurate) newsroom axiom \u201cif it bleeds, it leads\u201d. Private investigator Holly Gibney is watching breaking news coverage of a bomb attack at a middle school when she notices something odd about the reporter, Chet Ondowsky. A little background research suggests that Ondowsky\u2019s being first on the scene at incidents of horrific carnage is no coincidence, and Holly wonders if the reporter might be deliberately causing atrocities. King marries an obvious affection for the tropes of old gumshoe movies with carefully researched forensic technology to create an odd hybrid of procedural and horror that ratchets up the suspense, even if it feels a little familiar to readers of <em>The Outsider</em>, or the trilogy of Bill Hodges novels in which Holly first appeared.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/27/if-it-bleeds-review-stephen-king-on-vintage-form\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/27/if-it-bleeds-review-stephen-king-on-vintage-form", "date_published": "2020-04-27 06:00:35+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Pandemic jeopardises support for world's poor as charities lose millions", "description": "<p>British government urged to plug shortfall as Oxfam and Christian Aid reveal huge financial impact of Covid-19 outbreak</p><p>Charities are calling on the UK government for greater support as they report the loss of millions of pounds as a result of Covid-19.</p><p>Oxfam said it is losing \u00a35m a month from the closure of its shops alone, while Christian Aid last week said it expected a \u00a36m drop in its funds this financial year.
