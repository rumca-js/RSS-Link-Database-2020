<p>Australians have developed a sudden hunger for homemade cinnamon scrolls – so why not embrace the traditional fika treat</p><p>I had a weird day on the weekend. Over breakfast, I checked Instagram and noticed four different friends flaunting the cinnamon scrolls they had made. A little later in the morning, I rang my partner, who told me he was munching on a cinnamon scroll his mum had baked the previous day. Then, in the early afternoon, the doorbell rang. The trio of red-headed children from next door gifted, from a safe social distance of course, the household with a plate of cinnamon scrolls that they’d whipped up. It was extremely adorable.</p><p>As I chewed on a scroll (which was light, fluffy and expertly spiced – well done kids), I wondered: why the heck is everyone making these things? Is it just me? Is it a sign from the universe that I haven’t eaten enough carbs this quarantine, not that I need justification? Was this a weird glitch in the Matrix? And more importantly, does that make me Neo?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/28/iso-baking-the-cinnamon-scroll-is-the-treat-of-the-moment-heres-how-to-make-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Daily CO<sub>2</sub> counts from Hawaii make depressing reading – but this year the usual pattern may change</p><p>Since the Guardian began <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/05/why-the-guardian-is-putting-global-co2-levels-in-the-weather-forecast">daily reports of the atmospheric carbon dioxide count from Mauna Loa</a>, in Hawaii, they have made depressing reading. The count has been going up faster than at any time in human history. A combination of wildfires in California, Australia and the Amazon, more coal stations in China and minor trends such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/new-cars-producing-more-carbon-dioxide-than-older-models">British motorists buying ever</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/new-cars-producing-more-carbon-dioxide-than-older-models"> bigger cars</a> have all made extra contributions to the already profligate use of fossil fuels. On 18 April CO<sub>2</sub> reached 416.76 parts per million, 3.13 ppm more than last year, and way above the 350 ppm scientists consider to be safe. The “safe level” is a euphemism – above that limit areas in the tropics become too hot and dry to be habitable, many coastal cities sink below sea level and millions join mass migrations.</p><p>In May the readings usually begin to drop as plants and trees in the northern hemisphere remove carbon from the atmosphere in their spring spurt of growth, only for levels to rise again in the autumn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/27/weatherwatch-after-coronavirus-climate-future">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Damaging ideas within the Conservative party have weakened our ability to defeat the virus</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic struck the United Kingdom when its National Health Service was on its knees suffering from staff shortages and the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50397856" title="">longest waiting times</a> ever recorded. A decade of austerity had taken a terrible toll. Yet public satisfaction in the NHS <a href="https://www.nuffieldtrust.org.uk/news-item/public-satisfaction-with-the-nhs-rose-sharply-in-2019-why" title="">went up</a>. This surprising gap between the NHS failures and the public’s belief in the health system seems to have been driven by the support from across the political spectrum for more funding. This probably, say researchers, started to impact on public perceptions, most notably on their optimism for the future.</p><p>It would be a mistake to think the spread of Covid-19 can be checked by hope alone. The last 10 years have undermined the ability of the government to respond effectively and efficiently. As the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/26/uk-coronavirus-response-utterly-hypocritical-says-un-poverty-expert" title="">told the Guardian</a>, the “most damaging aspects of ‘austerity’ cannot and will not be undone” and represent “the fatal weakening of the community’s capacity to cope”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-tests-ideology-has-hurt-the-uk">Continue reading...</a>

Over the last decade the foundation has become one of rugby league’s best known philanthropic enterprises. During the coronavirus crisis it has been delivering food and protective equipment to households in St Helens and, as a proud Saints fan at a temporary loose end, Vegas has been cheerfully mucking in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/27/rugby-league-clubs-are-the-beating-heart-of-their-community-and-must-survive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This government’s competence has been questionable throughout the coronavirus crisis. We need real transparency<br /></p><p>Lockdown is breaking down. Or is it? The Daily Express has pictures of packed beaches in Brighton, yet locals dispute their veracity. Traffic was at its highest over the weekend since restrictions began. Rumours abound that cleaners and nannies are being quietly rehired; that people are visiting loved ones under an array of special circumstances. On Sunday, you could smell the barbecues – but what were you doing out, within smelling distance, anyway? The guy in front of me in Co-op was buying 48 beers and a tub of ice-cream. But he can’t have been having a party, I decided. No way was that enough ice-cream.</p><p>In the last days of March, there was huge solidarity around the restrictions themselves: 10 days in, there was a much sourer unity building around censure of the bad people, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns">the ones </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/uk-sunbathers-stricter-coronavirus-lockdowns">who were sunbathing</a>. I suspect a new, nudge-nudge-wink-wink solidarity will emerge around noncompliance, which will go head-to-head against the group that remains committed to lockdown. But the lines will be confusing: especially in the US, but also here in Britain, those ideologically most aligned to the government are the ones that reject its proscriptions most strongly. Lockdown is active and collective – we all have to do it, constantly, for it to exist at all. So the process around it has to be deliberative, just, consensual and transparent – otherwise the buy-in will evaporate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/boris-johnson-message-britain-lockdown-trust-us-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Due to the lockdown, all fertility treatments are postponed. It is a terrifying time for women whose egg reserves are dwindling and who have no idea when the process will begin again<br /></p><p>Her fertility medication had arrived and Ellen Rayment was waiting for the first day of her period so she could begin taking it. Rayment, a 40-year-old health professional from East Sussex, had been trying to conceive with her wife Debby for three years. It had been costly and emotionally draining. The Rayments were declined treatment on the NHS because they were using donor genetic material, so they had spent in excess of £20,000 on private IVF.</p><p>In November 2019, Rayment had miscarried twins at 22 weeks. After taking some time to both physically recover and grieve, Rayment’s doctor gave her the go-ahead to proceed with egg implantation using the final frozen embryo from their second round of IVF in March. She was waiting for her period to start before taking the medication to thicken her uterine wall, ahead of embryo implantation. But when that came it was on the same day Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus. All non-urgent medical procedures, including IVF, would be postponed. Her clinic called her to confirm the bad news.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/27/time-precious-ivf-women-fear-lost-chance-to-have-children">Continue reading...</a>

When Dominic Raab was asked last week if the government would commit to holding a public inquiry, he resorted to the impatient language of priorities. “When we get through this crisis,” he huffed, only then will it be “important to take stock”.</p><p>Here’s what we already know. The government delayed implementing a lockdown for no clear reason – perhaps it was the prime minister’s outsized regard for the “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-exposed-myth-british-exceptionalism">freedom-loving instincts of the British people</a>”, or a misguided bid to pursue “herd immunity” – and then reversed its position. Weeks were wasted, and thousands of lives were lost. The government abruptly stopped its contact-tracing programme in mid-March; it claimed mass testing wasn’t necessary, and then U-turned while repeatedly shifting the goalposts on the number of tests to be done. It did not provide adequate levels of PPE for NHS and care home staff, and hundreds of workers are dying. This government’s Conservative predecessors underfunded the NHS and undermined the UK’s preparedness for a major crisis such as a pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/27/public-inquiry-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The horror writer is at his familiar best with four suspenseful and sometimes surprisingly tender novellas </p><p>Stephen King has made good use of the sometimes tricky novella form over his nearly 50-year career, often as a vehicle to explore ideas and styles that lie off the more familiar path of his horror novels. <em>If It Bleeds</em> brings together four new stories, all offering vintage King themes with their own particular twist.</p><p>The showpiece here is the title novella, a sequel of sorts to King’s 2018 novel <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/18/the-outsider-by-sephen-king">The Outsider</a></em>, which was shown as a 10-part HBO series at the beginning of this year. The title comes from the callous (but accurate) newsroom axiom “if it bleeds, it leads”. Private investigator Holly Gibney is watching breaking news coverage of a bomb attack at a middle school when she notices something odd about the reporter, Chet Ondowsky. A little background research suggests that Ondowsky’s being first on the scene at incidents of horrific carnage is no coincidence, and Holly wonders if the reporter might be deliberately causing atrocities. King marries an obvious affection for the tropes of old gumshoe movies with carefully researched forensic technology to create an odd hybrid of procedural and horror that ratchets up the suspense, even if it feels a little familiar to readers of <em>The Outsider</em>, or the trilogy of Bill Hodges novels in which Holly first appeared.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/27/if-it-bleeds-review-stephen-king-on-vintage-form">Continue reading...</a>

It was, she says, “practically nonexistent” at her school, which is ironic, given that she is responsible for one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/sex-education">most candid TV shows</a> ever made about the subject. “They didn’t talk about female pleasure at all,” says the writer. “I’m in my 30s and I feel like I’m only now starting to get the right language to talk about my own body. I think, ‘God, I wish I’d known this stuff when I was in my 20s.’”</p><p>When Sex Education was picked up, Nunn had no big credits to her name. She had written and directed a couple of short films and had worked up ideas for production companies, but nothing had quite landed. Then, suddenly, she had a hit – such a hit that Netflix’s UK headquarters now has a Sex Education-themed floor. (We meet on the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jul/22/stranger-things-netflix-duffer-brothers">Stranger Things</a> floor, though.

This time, virtual hosting duties fell to Brad Pitt, playing lead member of the White House coronavirus task force, Dr Anthony Fauci. The raspy voiced physician thanks “all the older women in America who have sent me supportive, inspiring and sometimes graphic emails”, before clearing up a number of President Trump’s false claims about coronavirus.</p><p>Regarding Trump’s statements about a vaccine being ready “relatively soon”, Fauci explains, “If you were to tell a friend, I’ll be over relatively soon, and then showed up a year-and-a-half later, your friend may be relatively pissed off.” Per the president’s claims that “everyone” has access to the tests, he translates: “What he meant was – almost no one.” By the time he gets to Trump’s latest ramblings, regarding injecting light and disinfectant in the human body, he’s too dumbstruck to even respond. Pitt wraps up by removing his prosthetics and sincerely thanking Fauci and all medical first responders for their service, before announcing: “Live, kinda, from all across America, it’s Saturday Night.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/26/saturday-night-live-brad-pitt-dr-anthony-fauci-virtual-episode">Continue reading...</a>
