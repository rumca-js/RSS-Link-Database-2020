<p>Rather than admit responsibility for being behind the curve, ministers instead seek to delegitimise the media for asking questions about why Britain failed</p><p>Ibsen’s 19th-century play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An_Enemy_of_the_People" title="">An Enemy of the People</a> is a political drama about a physician who tries to save his town from water pollution only to wind up as a scapegoat. For the doctor the issue is health; after testing the water supply he urges a shutdown and new pipes to be laid to save lives. The town’s mayor is concerned about the economic cost. Better, the politician reasons, to keep the town open and correct the problem gradually. In the moral combat that ensues it is the doctor who becomes alienated from the town he struggled to protect. The play’s message is a counsel of democratic despair: that might is more powerful than right.</p><p>This insight has not been lost on the British government. Like Ibsen’s fictional politician, ministers refused to see the viral threat. Boris Johnson did not want to contemplate a draconian response. When they did act, ministers found they were behind in a global race for critical resources such as ventilators, testing capacity and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52440641" title="">personal protective equipment</a>. The failure to move decisively to suppress the pandemic lies at the root of the mess.

<p>One figure in particular is being closely scrutinised as ministers decide when to end lockdown</p><p>R, or the “effective reproduction number”, is a way of rating a disease’s ability to spread. It’s the average number of people on to whom one infected person will pass the virus. For an R of anything above 1, an epidemic will grow exponentially. Anything below 1 and an outbreak will fizzle out – eventually.</p><p>At the start of the coronavirus epidemic, the estimated R for coronavirus was between 2 and 3 – higher than the value for seasonal flu, but lower than for measles. That means that each person would pass it on to between two and three people on average, before either recovering or dying, and each of those people would each pass it on to a further two to three others, causing the total number of cases to snowball over time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-actually-signify">Continue reading...</a>

<p>New technology tends to be difficult to implement. Unfortunately for many workers, difficult is the new normal</p><p>It’s funny how quickly the strange and unfamiliar become routine. After weeks of awkwardness at the supermarket checkout, suddenly the choreography is getting easier: I’ve almost mastered the new rhythm of packing, waiting decorously for the cashier to move their hand away before swooping on whatever they’ve passed across the scanner. Even the sight of conveyor belts being doused with disinfectant after every customer seems almost normal now, although it shouldn’t.</p><p>Supermarket workers have been the forgotten heroes of lockdown, valiantly turning up to work for not much money in one of the few public places the virus can still easily spread, providing the only friendly faces some customers will see until next week. All of which makes the constant appeals over the in-store PA for shoppers to download self-scanning apps – don’t check out, just zap everything as you sling it in the trolley and go! – frankly disconcerting. It sounds the kindest thing, shielding till staff from our filthy germs. But what stops me signing up is a nagging worry about what happens to the cashiers when most people no longer need them. Doing them out of a job seems no way to reward their service. But is queueing at their checkouts morally any better, if all it does is endanger them?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-disruption-automation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Walter Scheidel explains how the fallout from coronavirus could be the catalyst for a more equal world</p><p>If the affliction of coronavirus has shamed us into anything, it is a vivid appreciation of just how cruelly topsy-turvy our world is. Low-paid healthcare workers, bin collectors, bus drivers and supermarket shelf stackers, not hedge fund managers or venture capitalists, have kept us from falling apart. It has taken actual disaster to expose the deep-seated social injustices and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/sep/09/inequality-is-it-rising-and-can-we-reverse-it"> inequalities</a> that we knew, but seemed to have forgotten, are hardwired into our economy. So could the global convulsion caused by the pandemic put us on the path to greater equality?</p><p>The Austrian economic historian Walter Scheidel argues that throughout history, from the stone age onwards, pandemic is one of the only four events capable of bringing about greater equality. War, state collapse and revolution are the other three.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/walter-scheidel-a-shock-to-the-established-order-can-deliver-change">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Co-author with Per Wahlöö of the Martin Beck crime series that blazed a trail for Scandinavian crime fiction</p><p>Widely regarded as the godmother of modern Scandinavian crime fiction, Maj Sjöwall, who has died aged 84, was the co-author of 10 detective stories featuring the Swedish policeman Martin Beck – a series remarkable as much for the way it was written as for its impact on crime-writing internationally. </p><p>Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö met in 1962 while working as magazine journalists and translators in Stockholm. She was 27, twice divorced and a single mother; he was 36, married with one child. They were instantly attracted to each other, shared a love of leftwing politics and detective stories, and soon decided to live together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/30/maj-sjowall-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This 1960s classic about a mouse who wants to learn the balalaika and tour central Europe seems entirely different to today’s rainbow picture books</p><p>The figures loom out of pitch black, heavy boots kicking up in thick smudges, hands roughly smeared above their heads as they dance to the music of the balalaika, which is only a suggestion on the page, scratched into the thick paint of John Burningham’s illustration. This 1964 picture book, about how a mouse called Trubloff comes to travel with Gypsies, listen to their music and learn to play the balalaika, is a well-known classic. But the heart of the story lies unspoken on the page: the fiery Gypsy music that inspires Trubloff to leave his family and that will eventually save them all.</p><p>Trubloff is one of a family of mice who live behind the panelling of the Parlour Bar, an inn in “part of a little village in central Europe where the winters were cold and snowy”. He comes to fall in love with the music played by the wandering Gypsies but when old Nabakoff, the craftsman mouse, makes him a balalaika of his own, Trubloff is disappointed to find that “playing the balalaika was not easy”. A kindly old Gypsy says he would have offered the young mouse lessons if they weren’t leaving that night – so Trubloff stows away and his travels across the frozen fields begin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/apr/30/my-favourite-book-as-a-kid-trubloff-by-john-burningham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Film about assistant to a New York film mogul details how stress, humiliation and bullying become the enablers for abuse by powerful men </p><p>A hundred micro-aggressions add up to one macro horror, a thousand petty humiliations snowball into a big swallowed insult, a million infected paper cuts metastasise into a giant tumour of abuse. This is the situation in Kitty Green’s gripping #MeToo drama-thriller The Assistant, a nightmare of toxic office politics and media misogyny that now reaches streaming platforms after its showing at the Berlin film festival earlier this year. Its chill has deepened in my mind ever since.</p><p>This is a claustrophobic, intimately unsettling movie about the young female assistant to an arrogant, abusive New York-based film mogul, like the one now doing jail time in Rikers Island. It can claim to be the first drama that addresses the #MeToo issue: set before this behaviour was publicly challenged, part of the film’s point could well be to suggest that the abuse continues right now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/23/the-assistant-review-metoo-drama-offers-unsettling-study-of-day-to-day-abuse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Wistful lyrics, a knowing Beatles riff … this demo doesn’t break the mould but it is one of Noel Gallagher’s best latter-day efforts. Just don’t hold your breath on a reunion</p><p>It says something about the grip Oasis still exert over the national consciousness – or perhaps about the current lack of any music news that doesn’t involve well-meaning-but-ghastly charity singles – that Noel Gallagher putting out a demo of an unreleased song by his former band is deemed something worth reporting everywhere from the national press to the Dorset Echo.</p><p>The news has caused speculation over a reformation of the band 11 years after their split. Noel Gallagher is famously the kind of enigmatic and unknowable pop star who communicates with his fans only in impenetrable riddles, as in his recent response to a question about a possible Oasis reunion: he described his brother Liam as “that fucking idiot” and said he’d instead been considering “burning his house down or smashing his car in”.

I’ve had weird luck lately – or “blessings in disguise”, a phrase that more and more I can’t hear without thinking of someone or something wearing a trenchcoat and dark glasses.</p><p>In the film Moonstruck, Ronny Cammareri loses his hand in a bread-slicer while talking to his brother. Ronny’s fiancé leaves him, and for five years he blames his brother. Then he meets Loretta Castorini, who has a theory.

<p>At her death, as in her life, the very areas of British society hardest hit by coronavirus were front and centre<br /></p><p>My darling mother died early this month. Her death was peaceful and painless – and it was not due to the coronavirus.<strong> </strong>Yet it was shaped by the pandemic, as is its aftermath. The register office, the undertakers, the crematorium: the usual institutions of death are now inundated. The administrative and social rituals that busy your mind have practically disappeared. The friends dropping by, the swell of a funeral, the hugs: all are statutorily absent.</p><p>It began with a urinary tract infection, of all things: a bothersome visitor but hardly unknown to my mother. If her body could not fight it off, then ordinarily an ambulance would whisk her off to hospital for stronger drugs and a bag of fluids. Not this time. The hospitals were almost overwhelmed, I was told, and parts are rife with contagion. And already she was so weak. On my mother’s last afternoon, I sat by her bedside, on the phone to the community matron, who told me that another nursing home had that day sent a resident to A&amp;E – just for the medics to call and say they were returning her to the home to die.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/my-mother-life-british-society-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Stress can affect the quality and length of sleep. Scientists have been collecting dream data during the coronavirus crisis, with surprising results</p><p>From going to bed too late thanks to endless scrolling through theories about the pandemic, to waking up in the night worrying, it is safe to say that Covid-19 is wreaking havoc with our sleep. A <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/life-under-lockdown-coronavirus-in-the-uk">major survey</a> conducted by King’s College London with Ipsos Mori showed that two in five people in the UK have reported sleep disturbance. Prof Bobby Duffy, the research lead and director of the Policy Institute at King’s, says: “There is a clear relationship between increased stress and impact on sleep; 53% of those who said they found the crisis stressful reported sleep difficulties.” But many people around the world are also experiencing a new phenomenon: pandemic dreams.</p><p>Most of us don’t often remember our dreams, but the anxieties of life in isolation and disruption to our normal sleep-wake cycles seem to be changing that. Several researchers are collecting dream data during the pandemic, including Dr Deirdre Barrett, a clinical and evolutionary psychologist at Harvard Medical School. She explains that, although it seems that we are dreaming more often, we are actually remembering them better because we’re sleeping more, but also waking up more during the night. “With more options to sleep, including napping in the day and longer lie-ins, dream recall is maximised, but you have to wake up out of a dream to remember it. We know that increased stress is a cause of waking frequently during the night.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/30/our-pandemic-subconscious-why-we-seem-to-be-dreaming-much-more-and-often-of-insects">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Documentary photographer <a href="https://www.olivia-harris.co.uk/">Olivia Harris</a> has been encountering the broad section of society helping others during the pandemic</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The stories are really what make the pictures interesting. Everyone I’ve photographed is helping out the NHS in one way or another, but I found community groups, or mutual aid networks, are much more active on the ground. I’m interested by the comparative effectiveness of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/16/community-aid-groups-set-up-across-uk-amid-coronavirus-crisis">mutual aid</a> structure v the lumbering official NHS volunteer scheme. Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person “in need” and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/sitting-at-home-seems-wrong-coronavirus-volunteers-helping-the-nhs-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After school board in Alaska pulls books by authors including F Scott Fitzgerald from the curriculum, local businesses are working to encourage reading them<br /></p><p>A school board in Alaska has got more than it bargained for after pulling classics including The Great Gatsby and I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings from the school curriculum, with members of the local community offering incentives to students to read the books anyway – including $100 (£80) prizes and free mac’n’cheese.</p><p>The Matanuska-Susitna borough school board in Palmer, Alaska, which oversees 46 schools, voted last week to remove five books from its curriculum for high-school English: F Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby, Maya Angelou’s I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Joseph Heller’s Catch-22, Ralph Ellison’s Invisible Man, and short-story collection The Things They Carried by Tim O’Brien. According to<a href="https://twitter.com/matsu_news/status/1253215321017602048"> local paper the Frontiersman News</a>, five members voted in favour of the removal, and two voted against.

<p>With gyms and studios worldwide off limits, online exercise classes are booming – and one Texan teacher has become the ‘patron saint of quarantine’. By Marisa Meltzer</p><p>Hop into something comfy and let’s get started!” This is how Adriene Mishler, YouTube’s biggest yoga guru, begins many of her videos. For those of us who are not spending our quarantine days writing an update of King Lear or attempting to follow along with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/apr/01/shape-of-the-future-how-barrys-bootcamp-changed-the-way-we-work-out" title="">Barry’s Bootcamp</a> on Instagram, Mishler’s just-show-up approach to yoga is a comfort and a welcome distraction. In recent months, she has been described as “the patron saint of quarantine” (Paper magazine), “the most influential yoga teacher on the planet” (Refinery29), and “Our saviour” (a fan on Twitter).</p><p>Mishler was already huge before the pandemic – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene" title="">her channel</a>, which has more than 7 million subscribers, is the first to pop up when you search for “yoga” on YouTube – but the lockdown has catapulted her to a new level of fame. Fans on social media recommend their favourite videos, post charcoal drawings of her and express their undying devotion to her for keeping them sane. One devotee even built <a href="https://twitter.com/benagain/status/1250357935601004550" title="">a digital replica</a> of her home studio in the video game Animal Crossing. There are countless memes about her, as well as ones about her dog, a blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, named Benji, who frequently makes cameo appearances lounging beside the mat, or wandering into shot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/apr/30/yoga-with-adriene-how-the-youtube-star-won-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His guilt over Kurt Cobain’s death, his scrap with Liam Gallagher, his year getting clean ... the former Screaming Trees frontman reveals why writing his memoirs hurt </p><p>Mark Lanegan was born to an abusive mother and a hard-drinking father, his umbilical cord wrapped around his neck. Things went downhill from there. By 12, as he recounts in his new memoir, <a href="https://www.roughtrade.com/gb/mark-lanegan/sing-backwards-and-weep">Sing Backwards and Weep</a>, he was a “compulsive gambler, a fledgling alcoholic, a thief, a porno fiend”. By 18, his criminal record included breaking and entering, shoplifting, drug possession, vandalism, insurance fraud and 26 counts of underage drinking.</p><p>By 21, he was in proto-grungers <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/screaming-trees-grunge-s-nearly-men">Screaming Trees</a>. Not that he wanted to be: it was his only route out of the “dusty cow town” of Ellensburg, Washington, which he left on the trail of “decadence, depravity, anything, everything”. At 29, eight albums later, he was living in Seattle, chain-smoking in dirty boxers and a stained bathrobe, and watching soap operas when one of his best friends kept phoning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/30/mark-lanegan-screaming-trees-kurt-cobain-death-liam-gallagher-sing-backwards-and-weep">Continue reading...</a>
