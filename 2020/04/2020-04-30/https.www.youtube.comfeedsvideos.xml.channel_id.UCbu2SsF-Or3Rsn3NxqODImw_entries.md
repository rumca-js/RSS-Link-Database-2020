Naughty Dog's 2013 PlayStation 3 exclusive The Last Of Us is one of the most highly regarded games of the past decade. With the sequel due for release in June, you might be thinking about playing the original game the first time or returning to experience the survival story once more.

In a new video feature, Jess dives into what makes Joel and Ellie's tumultuous cross-country adventure stay timeless and affecting seven years later. Jess argues that The Last of Us' greatest strength is timeless--its portrayal of complex characters embroiled in an emotional and heart-wrenching fight for survival. 

The video covers much more, including how the game cleverly keeps resources limited to elevate its themes of survival and desperation, and how the narrative's linear format and deliberate pace helps drive home the game's most impactful scenes and character moments.

Be sure to check out the full video above, and keep coming back to GameSpot for more Last of Us coverage in the lead-up to The Last Of Us 2's release in June.

## Assassin's Creed Valhalla Story Details & Characters: What We Know So Far

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is set at the height of the Viking Age, and we spoke to game's narrative director about crafting its unique story. 

Valhalla focuses on the Viking clans as they are driven out of Norway s. You play as clan leader Eivor, who can be either a man or woman, much like Assassin's Creed Odyssey's dual protagonists Alexios and Kassandra. We explore this, and more information about the game, in the video above.

Valhalla releases on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, and PC via the Epic Games Store this holiday. There are multiple special editions in the works, so check GameSpot's pre-order guide for pricing information.

Over the course of an eight-hour livestream, Ubisoft slowly revealed that the rumors were true: the next Assassin's Creed game will take place during The Viking Age. Called Assassin's Creed Valhalla, the game is scheduled to get a brand-new trailer very soon.

If you missed out on the livestream or couldn't watch the whole thing (because, again, it was eight hours long), we have you covered. The video above is a sped-up timelapse of the complete stream, condensing the entire experience into five minutes. That's a little bit more manageable in our opinion.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is scheduled to release this year, though an exact launch date hasn't been announced yet--Ubisoft hasn't revealed which systems the game is coming out for either, though it's a good bet we'll see the game on Xbox One, PS4, PC, Xbox Series X, and PlayStation 5.

Given the time period--The Viking Age started in the ninth century and continued through to the eleventh--it's likely Valhalla will continue the origin story of the Assassin Brotherhood and Templar Order, which began in Assassin's Creed Origins and continued in Assassin's Creed Odyssey. The Viking Age actually ends just before the events of the original 2007 Assassin's Creed.

## Evolution of Assassin’s Creed Gameplay - From The Holy Land To Valhalla

With the announcement that Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is taking us to the Viking Age, let’s take a look back at how the gameplay of Ubisoft’s flagship franchise has evolved over time. From early days of Altair's social stealth, to Ezio's city renovations, Edward's naval combat, Bayek's Eagle Vision, and beyond. Let’s delve into the Animus and explore the series major gameplay evolutions.

With the announcement of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Ubisoft's popular history-based franchise dives into The Viking Age, which occurred between the ninth and eleventh centuries. Funnily enough, that's right before the events of 2007's Assassin's Creed, the game that started this massive franchise in the first place--meaning Ubisoft has almost gone full circle.

Or at least it has in terms of its story. When it comes to gameplay, the franchise as a whole has been a steady evolution. What started as a stealth-driven action game has now become a franchise defined by its massive open worlds and action-focused combat. In the video above, Lucy James details this full transformation, describing how the mechanics and features of Assassin's Creed have changed since 2007.

Full disclosure: the video only covers the mainline entries of Assassin's Creed. That means we skip over handheld titles (like Assassin's Creed Pirates and Assassin's Creed Rebellion) and spin-offs (such as Assassin's Creed III: Liberation and Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China). It's not that those games haven't contributed long-term gameplay traditions or storybeats too, but this video is already over 10 minutes long--it would be a monstrous task to cover all 22 Assassin's Creed games.

Side note: Can you believe that there have been 22 (soon to be 23) Assassin's Creed games in 13 years? Which one was your favorite? Let us know in the comments section below.
