Star Wars: The Clone Wars combined with WETA Workshop\u2019s Mini Epics line of figures (specifically the Gandalf the Grey painting by Vanderstelt Studio) would provide the perfect launching pad to bring the next great animated series to the world.  The final season of The Clone Wars currently airing on Disney+, with it\u2019s amazing visuals and incredible storytelling have convinced me that the time is now for the next adaptation of Tolkien\u2019s most famous work.\n\nHow incredible would it be to see episodes and arcs adapting Tom Bombadil, the Barrow-wights, the War in the North, and many other plot points that wouldn\u2019t fit into a 3-hour film?  Another reason for animation?  Topping Peter Jackson\u2019s masterpiece trilogy is a monumental (impossible?) task.  Meanwhile, the bar for animated adaptations is much lower and with the incredible advances in technology, animation can finally do justice to the world and heroes of Middle-earth.\n\n(NOTE: There are NOT Order 66 spoilers in this video)\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings! \n\n\n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
