## The Masters 1996: Faldo triumphs as Norman blows six-shot lead - as it happened

<p>Greg Norman shipped a six-shot 54-hole lead as Nick Faldo won his third green jacket with a glorious final-day 67.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-04-11T20:26:35.571Z">9.26pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p><strong>And look, let’s cut Greg some slack, shall we.</strong> It’s no time for a pile-on. If that 70-footer on 14 had dropped ... if that chip for eagle on 15 went in ... yeah, yeah, your auntie and uncle. But we’re talking the combined width of a couple of dimples here; it wouldn’t have taken too much to shift the momentum. Sure, you can’t deny the scale and scope of the collapse ... but things are never totally black and white, and it’d be dreadful if history forgets how Norman nearly pulled it back round when his dreams were crumbling. Just as it’d be an outrage if Faldo’s 67 doesn’t go down as one of the great final rounds in the entire history of championship golf, one of <em>the</em> carpe-diem performances. Faldo’s been pretty good at those over the years, you know.</p><p><strong><em>-12:</em></strong><em> Nick Faldo<br /> <strong>-7: </strong>Greg Norman<br /> <strong>-6: </strong>Phil Mickelson<br /> <strong>-5: </strong>Frank Nobilo<br /> <strong>-4: </strong>Scott Hoch, Duffy Waldorf<br /> <strong>-3: </strong>Davis Love III, Jeff Maggert, Corey Pavin<br /> <strong>-2: </strong>David Frost, Scott McCarron</em></p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-04-11T20:20:48.739Z">9.20pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p><strong>But take nothing away from Nick Faldo, who now joins Jimmy Demaret, Sam Snead and Gary Player as a three-time Masters champion. </strong>That’s some exalted company; only Arnold Palmer (four) and Jack Nicklaus (six) have won more. Throw in his three Opens, and that’s a total of six majors, putting him up there on the all-time list alongside Lee Trevino, and ahead of the likes of Byron Nelson, Peter Thomson and Seve! Faldo never seems to get the credit he deserves for his brilliance, his talent, his street-fighting moxie. And no doubt today’s 67 will become another example of that trend, eclipsed by the Norman psychodrama. But what a final round! Six birdies today, and a serene swing around Amen Corner, not a single bat of the eyelid as he traversed the most notoriously mind-bending stretch in major-championship golf. What a golfer! What a champion! England’s greatest sporting star of all time? He’s got a claim.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/apr/11/the-masters-1996-greg-norman-final-round-live">Continue reading...</a>

## Pivotal Pivatelli: how random events helped elevate two great Milan sides | Jonathan Wilson

<p>Gino Pivatelli does not have a prominent place in the hearts of Milan fans but a foul in a European Cup final and telling Arrigo Sacchi he wasn’t good enough changed history</p><p>You can plan, you can plan and you can plan some more and then something happens over which you had no control, that you couldn’t reasonably have been expected to foresee, and everything changes. That’s not to say that there’s no point in coaches and directors planning, but it is to say that there are times when entirely external events take control – and that doesn’t have to mean something as enormous as coronavirus. Football can turn on events that seem random, unconnected, unpredictable – the bounce of a ball, the shape of the goalposts, the eruption of an Icelandic volcano – or on the unlikely influence of one man.</p><p>Take, for example, the case of Gino Pivatelli, a forward for Bologna, Verona and Napoli who was top scorer in Serie A in 1955-56 and won seven caps for Italy. At the end of his career, he played 37 games for Milan, by which time he had lost some of his pace and sharpness in front of goal. He never managed them. And yet without him, the first two of their eras of European pre-eminence may never have come about.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/11/pivotal-pivatelli-how-random-events-helped-elevate-two-great-milan-sides">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The recent death of Linda Tripp reminded us of a shocking act of betrayal</p><p>More than two decades on, there’s still something about what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/linda-tripp-dies-aged-70-monica-lewinsky-bill-clinton">Linda Tripp </a>did to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/monica-lewinsky">Monica Lewinsky</a> that makes you gasp at the female-on-female betrayal and also makes you wonder whether this is the most painful kind of betrayal.</p><p>Tripp has just died of cancer. When Lewinsky learned that Tripp was sick, she said: “No matter the past… I hope for her recovery. I can’t imagine how difficult this is for her family.” A graceful response and one in stark contrast to what Lewinsky said when the then US president Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about their affair: “I’m really sorry for everything that’s happened.

Driver had a new lease of life with her return to racing in last year’s W Series, but the coronavirus crisis has wrenched away the opportunity to build on that success<p>Twelve months ago Alice Powell described her return to motor racing as a new lease of life. After four years without a drive she grasped her chance in the all-female W Series with unbridled verve. However, with her career resurgent the opportunity to build on her success has been wrenched away by the coronavirus-induced sporting shutdown. It has struck Powell as a body blow. “The thought of having another year not racing is pretty gutting,” she says bluntly.</p><p>Powell fears there may be no racing this year but is emphatic that if that is necessary to defeat the virus, then every sport must take it on the chin. “My other half thinks that we might not go racing at all,” she says. “I say: ‘Don’t be silly,’ but in the back of my mind I think he could be right. That is really upsetting because last year was my time back racing after being out for a long time.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/11/alice-powell-w-series-interview-thought-year-not-racing-gutting">Continue reading...</a>

The scheme is there to be used, as the chancellor has said, so why have Tory MPs attacked clubs?<p>After a week of vitriolic criticism levelled at football clubs for using the government’s job retention scheme to put some employees on furlough during the Covid-19 crisis, on Wednesday some balance was finally applied. Considering that the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, had warned some Premier League clubs the scheme was not for them, and his fellow Conservative MP Julian Knight accused clubs of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/01/premier-league-clubs-accused-of-being-in-moral-vacuum-over-pay-coronavirus" title="">operating in a “moral vacuum”</a> by furloughing staff while still paying players, the source of the measured response was perhaps unlikely: their own chancellor, Rishi Sunak.</p><p>He was asked at the government’s Covid-19 press conference about reports that British companies could put <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-jobs-bailout-treasury-resolution-foundation-wage-subsidy-scheme" title="">a remarkable nine million people on furlough</a>, which, as the government pays 80% of a person’s wage up to £2,500 per month, could cost the Treasury £40bn in three months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/11/julian-knight-rishi-sunak-furlough-furore-premier-league-ignores-aim-protect-jobs">Continue reading...</a>

Competing ideologies, power blocs, leaders and systems of social cohesion are being stress-tested in the court of world opinion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/11/coronavirus-who-will-be-winners-and-losers-in-new-world-order">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Don’t throw out those tough kale stalks: they’re delicious, steamed, fried or in a ‘risotto’ with barley, lemon and breadcrumbs</p><p>Kale is a nitrogen-thirsty leaf with a strong structure and thick stem that, without proper preparation, is often tough and stringy. To prepare it, hold the thick end of the stem in one hand and clasp the fingers of your other hand around the base of the leaf, then pull up hard to strip off the leaf and put to one side. Repeat, piling up the stems in a stack, then finely chop them into 5mm pieces. Cutting the stems crossways shortens the fibres, much as with a tough steak, making them perfectly edible and preventing waste. Cut this way, the stems can be cooked in the same way as the rest of the leaf: sauteed, boiled or steamed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/11/tom-hunt-recipe-kale-stalks-waste-not">Continue reading...</a>
