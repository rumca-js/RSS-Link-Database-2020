With Valorant's closed beta, a select few have had hands-on experience with Riot Games' first competitive FPS. We've played it ourselves, and it seems that the development team behind League of Legends has drawn a lot of inspiration from the likes of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, and Rainbow Six Siege. But there's more to Valorant than just its influences. In this video, we break down the gameplay details and features in Valorant based on our time with the beta. 

Agents are basically heroes, all with unique sets of abilities and certain roles to fill. There's currently one mode of play, which is a five-on-five demolition mode with one team attacking and the other defending--the first team to 13 winning rounds takes the match. You purchase guns, gear, and powers each round, and have to factor an economic element when determining what equipment to buy. We also look at the features outside of gameplay and take a peek at the store to see what microtransactions are like.

We have another video you can check out which dives deeper into our overall impressions of Valorant's gameplay experience. Valorant is set to launch sometime in the Summer this year, so be sure to stick to GameSpot for more on the game.

A game being awarded a 10/10 is a rarity for GameSpot, and only a small handful of titles have received the prestigious award in the site's long history. Final Fantasy VII Remake is the latest to be inducted into the exclusive hall of fame and, if you've read our review of the game or watched the video review, you'll understand why.

In our review, Final Fantasy VII Remake was described as a reimagining of a beloved tale that marries top-notch storytelling with a smart mashup of action and RPG gameplay to deliver a must-play experience. 

During the GameSpot After Dark podcast Jake Dekker, Jean-Luc Seipke, and Lucy James talked to reviewer Tamoor Hussain a bit more about why he feels FF7R is an "Essential" game, by GameSpot's standards.

The discussion is spoiler-free and touches upon the world, combat, narrative, characterization, music, and more. There are multiple perspectives represented in the conversation, ranging from fans of the original to complete newcomers that are planning to play when it's available. Watch for an in-depth breakdown of how Final Fantasy VII Remake earns its 10.

Final Fantasy VII Remake has a lot of moving parts and it takes a bit of time to explain everything. This, within context, makes a lot of sense as it can be overwhelming to have information dumps coming at you constantly. Additionally, the game leaves some things to a bit of trial and experimentation so you can discover them in a more natural way.

If you're anything like us, however, you may find yourself asking a lot of questions long before the game is ready to give you answers. As experienced Final Fantasy players and fans of RPGs generally, we found ourselves jumping the gun a bit and we imagine you'll be doing the same. So, to save you from sweating the small stuff, getting caught up in trying to figure out how all the cogs and gears fit together, and perhaps diluting your enjoyment as a result, we've put together a bunch heads-ups that'll save you a bit of stress. 

Everything in here is largely spoiler-free, so you won't be unexpectedly hit with plot revelations or have surprises ruined. However, we know that sensitivities towards spoilers vary, so we'll mention that we are using gameplay footage from areas in the mid-game.

Final Fantasy 7 Remake modernizes the original game's turn-based battles by combining some of its tactical elements with more action-centric gameplay. You'll execute combos, fire off spells, and use cool moves in real-time in the remake, with a few of the most powerful moves and abilities from the original making an appearance.

If you're familiar with the original Final Fantasy 7, you know some of the most powerful attacks you can get in the game are Limit Breaks and Summons. Limit Breaks are super-strong moves unique to each character that you can only execute after you've dealt and received enough damage in a fight, while Summons are special magic spells that call huge monsters to aid you in battle. Both return in Final Fantasy 7 Remake in a slightly new form.

Check out the video above, where you can see every Limit Break and Summon in all their devastating glory. While you'll start with some Limit Breaks and receive one Summon through the course of the story, you'll have to earn the rest as you work your way through Final Fantasy 7 Remake. Be sure to read through our massive list of Final Fantasy 7 Remake guides if you need help finding any secrets or collectibles, or besting any bosses along the way.

## Mythbusting In Animal Crossing: New Horizons - What's Real And What's Not

The Animal Crossing franchise has always been a tricky one to understand, and the latest entry, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, is no exception. Though the game does a good job of informing you of the basics, there's still a lot that the tutorial never tells you. So it's up to the community to theorize, experiment, and inform. Unfortunately, this can sometimes make it difficult to know whether a rumor is true.

In the video above, Richie Bracamonte dives into six prevalent rumors that are currently circling the New Horizons community to let you know which are real and which are just myths. There's a good chance you'll ultimately just stumble upon the answers for yourself after enough playtime, but we urge you to watch anyway--in some cases, like "money trees always triple your Bells," believing in the rumor could cost you in the long run.

Richie specifically talks about the rumors about balloon colors, reporting villagers, money trees, gold tools, the in-game New Horizons Switch furniture item, and the mystery island hack. We believe these are the most pressing rumors to address, though let us know in the comments section if you think there are any others that you'd like for us to test.

In GameSpot's Animal Crossing: New Horizons review, Kallie Plagge writes, "New Horizons has a slower pace even than other Animal Crossing games, and at times, that can feel unnecessarily restrictive. But there's still plenty to do, and each of those activities feeds into the next brilliantly for a rewarding and relentlessly cheerful experience. New Horizons certainly came at the right time, and its strengths are particularly comforting right now. I'm as excited to see what random events await me each morning as I am glad to have it during hard times, and that's sure to keep me coming back for the foreseeable future."
