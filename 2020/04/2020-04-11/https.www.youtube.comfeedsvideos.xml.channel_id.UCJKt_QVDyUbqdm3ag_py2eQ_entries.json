These are all fresh recordings from my most Jeff-like chips (based on some recordings from his own chip). However, i don't know if all these were composed using that same chip. Whatever the case is, i like these. The darker filter curve gives these some nice character (i think at least). For the pixel art i used Christopherjam palette this time (more saturated colors). Headphones recommended as always.\n\nJumplist\n00:00 Evolver 6581 (2nd at X'2010), art \"Synastry\" (2020) by Rail Slave\n03:41 Commodore 64 (2004), art \"Exodus\" (2020) by Arcane\n06:14 X-Large 5 (2004), art \"Ernie\" by redcrab (1st at X'2018)\n07:36 6581 Doped Cows (1st at X'2006), art \"Eye of the Storm\" by Malmix (1st at Datastorm 2019)\n10:21 Reflex Tune (1996), art \"Cyberwolf\" by Mythus (1st at Flashback 2019)\n12:23 X-Large 4 (2002), art \"It's So Weird\" (2020) by Creep      \n14:00 Ode to C64 (2003), art \"Resting Ronin\" by MisBug (9th at Zoo 2019)\n16:51 Tanzen Jahh (1993), art \"Seeing is Believing\" by Facet (1st at Xenium 2019)\n19:06 X-Large 6 (2006), art \"4n____ki\" by Deev (1st at Syntax 2019)\n20:43 System F - Cry (2005), art \"October\" by Joe (1st at Syntax 2015)\n\nSome of these tracks were featured in my stereo Dolbyfied compilation ages ago (lighter filter curve):\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiSlPuCqEoM\n\nUltimate64 Elite real 6581 dual mono setup (identical audio data output for both chips, full channel separation):\n\nLeft channel: MOS 6581R4AR 0187 14/Hong Kong HH512134 HC-30\nRight channel: MOS 6581 3584/Korea AH325137\n\nUltimate64 Elite:\nhttps://ultimate64.com/Ultimate-64-Elite", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktDa9Fsj4Ds", "date_published": "2020-04-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
