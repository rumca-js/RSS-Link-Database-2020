We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Four years ago, I dug Adam Arcuragi's CD out a stack of many and was struck by his voice: powerful, but without the unnecessary melodrama that encumbers so many talented singers.

Then there was the poetry. All you have to do is read the title to the first Arcuragi song we put on All Songs Considered, titled "1981 (Or Waving at You As We Part at Light Speed Will Look Like I'm Standing Still)." His recent recording, I Am Become Joy, was just as appropriately titled; an uplifting record whose sorrow is shaken by the sound of old friends shouting at the rafters. (Only, unlike most of my friends, they can sing.)

When Arcuragi came to play at my desk, most of the folks here at NPR hadn't heard him. After hearing the three songs he played, many walked away amazed. I hope you do, too.

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (Home) Concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

April 11, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- Every time I saw John Prine perform, he invited friends to join him. The outpouring of love and respect has always been so profound. And so when John Prine died on April 7 from complications related to COVID-19, I knew his friends and those he touched would want to pay tribute to him. Here are five artists performing their favorite John Prine tune in their home (or bathtub) in honor of one of the greatest songwriters of any generation.

SET LIST

Margo Price and Jeremy Ivey, "That's the Way That the World Goes Round"
Courtney Marie Andrews, "Speed of the Sound of Loneliness"
John Paul White, "Sam Stone"
Nathaniel Rateliff, "All The Best"
Brandy Clark, "Speed of the Sound of Loneliness"
