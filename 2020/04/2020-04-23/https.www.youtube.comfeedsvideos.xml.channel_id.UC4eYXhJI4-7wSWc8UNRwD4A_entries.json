Welcome to Fogerty's Factory, the tricked-out basement where the Fogerty Family (John, his sons Tyler and Shane, and his daughter Kelsy) make music in these quarantined times. His desk is the road case his band Creedence Clearwater Revival used when they played Woodstock, and John shows off a guitar he played at the festival as well. He plays three of his CCR classics from 50 years ago (still singing in the same key), surrounded by family and sending out words of encouragement to all of us.\n\nSET LIST\n\n\"Centerfield\"\n\"Down On The Corner\"\n\"Long As I Can See The Light\"\n\"Proud Mary\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qW2139LKN0", "date_published": "2020-04-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "The Pop Ups: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.
