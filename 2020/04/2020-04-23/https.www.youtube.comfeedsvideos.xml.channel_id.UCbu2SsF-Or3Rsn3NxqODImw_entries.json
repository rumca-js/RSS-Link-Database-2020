That game was based on a sunken Indonesian ship, the Ourang Medan, and Little Hope is likewise based on a true story. Its New England setting may bring the Salem Witch Trials to mind, but that's not quite where developer Supermassive Games pulled its inspiration from.\n\nLittle Hope is actually based on the often overlooked Andover Witch Trials, which occurred north of Salem. Tony dives into the history of these events in the video above, explaining how they're deadlier than the stories often taught in history class.\n\nLittle Hope itself has no specific release date, but it's slated for PS4, Xbox One, and PC this summer.

Though it's neither a direct sequel to or expansion of XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad takes place after the events of the previous games. After getting our hands on the spin-off, we've discovered that Firaxis has changed plenty about XCOM's traditional formula.\n\nIn the video above, Aaron Sampson goes over six essential tips for succeeding in Chimera Squad. As mentioned before, even if you're a long-time fan of the series, you'll have to consider different mechanics and features if you hope to succeed in Chimera Squad. There's a new breaching phase at the start of every fight, for example, and turn order has been reworked.\n\nChimera Squad encourages you to make additional considerations outside of combat too. As XCOM's permadeath mode doesn't make a return, managing civil unrest becomes a significantly higher priority to preventing a game over. Your squadmates can be injured as well, and you'll have to let them rest or send them off to do some physical therapy training in order to heal.\n\nXCOM: Chimera Squad releases for PC on April 24. The game will launch on sale for $10 USD, though it will return to its original retail price of $20 USD on May 1.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD4RLzei1Js", "date_published": "2020-04-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Giving Fallout 76 Another Shot", "description": "Fallout 76 had a rocky launch, but with the Wastelanders update, you might be tempted to give it another shot. Here's what Jake Dekker has to say after spending 30 hours with the new update.\n\nThe long-awaited Wastelanders update comes with a number of changes, improvements, and new content. With that, you might be asking yourself: Should I give Fallout 76 another shot? GameSpot\u2019s video producer, Jake Dekker, has spent 30 hours exploring Appalachia to help you answer that very question.\n\nIn this video, Jake goes over all the big changes introduced in Fallout 76\u2019s Wastelanders update, including the new dialogue mechanics, the faction system, and the story. Although Fallout 76 suffers from many of the same issues it did at launch, Wastelanders seems to be a step in the right direction.\n\nFallout 76 Wastelanders is available now for PS4, Xbox One and PC.
