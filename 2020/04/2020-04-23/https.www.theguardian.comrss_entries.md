<p>April’s PMI data suggests the country will not bounce back quickly after the coronavirus lockdown</p><p>Take your pick for which number was more shocking. Was it the reading of 12.9 on the PMI survey of UK business activity in April, a figure that was many degrees worse than any recorded during the 2008 financial crash? Or was it the quadrupling of the government’s borrowing requirement to an astonishing £180bn over the next three months?</p><p>The dire numbers go hand-in-hand, obviously, but here’s the really worrying part for government: the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-lockdown-tips-uk-economy-into-biggest-slump-on-record">detail in the PMI data</a>, where a number below 50 suggests contraction, offered no support to the hopeful idea that the recovery will be rapid and V-shaped.

<p>Politicians are under pressure to level with the public about the scale and length of lockdown restrictions. It is time to open up</p><p>Downing Street’s daily press briefings on the coronavirus crisis have been taking place for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-statement-on-coronavirus-12-march-2020" title="">several weeks</a>. The format is now grindingly familiar. One day’s briefing varies little from the next. The reluctance of ministers and officials to stray from the agreed line is insulting and has caused increasing impatience, particularly as evidence has mounted of the terrible planning, procurement and supply distribution failures by the UK government before and during the ongoing outbreak.</p><p>That daily rhythm was briefly broken on Wednesday evening by the government’s chief medical officer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/22/uk-coronavirus-live-government-ppe-procurement-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ea0795b8f084784dca58150#block-5ea0795b8f084784dca58150" title="">Chris Whitty</a>. Departing from the usual cautious script in answer to a question, Prof Whitty made very clear that some of the government’s restrictive social measures are likely to remain in force until at least the end of 2020 and that it was “wholly unrealistic” to expect that life would return to normal soon. The Covid-19 virus was not going to disappear, so physical distancing and some lockdown measures were likely to continue for “really quite a long period of time”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/the-guardian-view-on-the-covid-19-lockdown-take-the-long-view">Continue reading...</a>

Packing stadiums has long been the Stones’ raison d’etre and they’re clearly aware they don’t need new songs to do that. On their most recent tour – which began in 2017 and would still be on course were it not for the coronavirus pandemic – the most up-to-the-minute addition to their setlist was 25 years old, which didn’t stop its European leg grossing an eye-watering $237m (£190m).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/23/the-rolling-stones-living-in-a-ghost-town-best-new-song-in-years-coronavirus-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

On ourselves, our relationships and what’s important to us. For some of us, that means reaching out to old friends, or healing old wounds with people we once thought we’d never speak to again. And in a way, the tech that helps us reconnect makes repairing those relationships easier: the screen gives us an element of safety, yet we can tap directly into those emotional connections we need to get us through this crisis.</p><p>Here, three people who found isolation has had a positive effect on their relationships share their experiences – from building bridges, to creating the foundations for better communication, and reconnecting with family members they haven’t spoken to in years …</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/apr/23/lockdown-made-me-realise-whats-important-meet-the-families-reconnecting-remotely">Continue reading...</a>

## While the UK's key workers lack PPE, ministers clapping for them is an insult | Owen Jones

Every Thursday at 8pm, neighbourhoods from Orkney to Penzance erupt with applause, cheers and the bangs of pots and pans. In a society in which an estimated three-quarters of us <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/britons-neighbours-strangers-uk-community-a8373761.html">don’t know</a> our neighbours’ names, communities bound together by shared appreciation for vital workers risking their lives during this crisis should move the stoniest of hearts.</p><p>To make a dissenting point may seem improper, an uncouth denigration of national unity amid unprecedented peacetime upheaval, but it must be made nonetheless. An expression of emotion stripped of meaning is an empty gesture; if riddled with hypocrisy, an insult. When an apology is given, and the sincerity is doubted, the common aggravated retort is: “Say sorry like you mean it.” When, therefore, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/video/boris-johnson-rishi-sunak-clap-nhs-2139202/">government ministers</a> applaud key workers who they have underpaid, whose social security entitlements they have slashed, whose health and lives have been imperilled by a lack of PPE, is it so impertinent to ask if they are clapping like they mean it?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/uk-key-workers-ppe-ministers-clapping-protect-nhs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Five of his favourite recipes that offer comfort and familiarity, cut down on shopping and make use of ingredients you might already have to hand</p><p>It is taking forever to do the food shopping. At first, finding a time when the queues will be at their shortest; joining the queue, suitably distancing myself from the next shopper, then, when finally inside the shop, trying to avoid getting close to others mulling over which piece of Parmesan to buy. And then, I start all over again at the next shop.</p><p>To reduce my trips to the absolute minimum (I’ve been taking lockdown very seriously) I have been raiding my own <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/18/lockdown-larder-the-best-store-cupboard-recipes-for-cheap-easy-meals">store-cupboard</a> at home and hunkering down on the carbs I have in store. I have probably eaten more beans, pasta and rice during lockdown than I did in the whole of last year. But that has been a good thing, reminding myself of dishes I may not have cooked in a while; stuff that might initially feel a little unseasonal, yet is strangely just what I need in times such as these.

The company been taken to court by Birmingham city council, and was launching a challenge using the evidence of the food microbiologist Slim Dinsdale, a swashbuckler of the pathogenic world, who favours the “smell it and see” approach. All of this was over-ruled by judges, who decided that use-by dates were, overall, still important enough for public safety to be observed.</p><p>This was, of course, all overshadowed, by the coronavirus outbreak; but the use-by date controversy has never been more up to date. The cook, author and campaigner Jack Monroe runs ad hoc advice sessions called Lockdown Larder on Twitter, and says: “Since I’ve been doing it, by a country mile the most-asked question I’ve had is: ‘I’ve got this yeast, it went out of date two months ago, can I use it? I’ve got these sardines, they went out of date a year ago, can I use them?’ People want someone they perceive to be an expert to reassure them. As a species, we seem to have lost the ability to trust our own senses.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/23/is-old-yeast-ok-the-17-rules-of-expiry-dates-from-eggs-to-meat-to-oils">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a pandemic, the best we can do to take care of one another is to stay away from one another. Even Freud at his most misanthropic could never have come up with that. By Gary Greenberg<br /></p><p>For the 35 years I have practised as a psychotherapist, I have discouraged people from seeing themselves as hapless victims of forces arrayed against them. That’s the whole premise – that whatever brought you to my office, it is hampering your ability to direct the course of your own life. So let’s name your pain and then do something about it. Tell off the boss, walk out on the husband, confront the perpetrator, whatever it takes, and then move on, become the agent of your existence.</p><p>It’s a profession that has been good to me, and I hope good for my patients. But what if the premise is undone by circumstance? What if it turns out that we <em>are</em> hapless victims of a force arrayed against us, that will mercilessly hijack the machinery of our lives, that is silent and invisible and leaves us with nothing to do but cower in our homes and wash our hands and hope that it will pass us by?
