Persia brings you all the biggest gaming stories for your April 23 Save State. Red Dead Redemption 2 is coming to Xbox One's Game Pass on May 7 and is already available for pre-download. It will also include Red Dead Online. GTA V will be leaving the service on the same day. 

In Netflix news, Castlevania Season 4 is confirmed and Pokemon Journeys will arrive on the streaming service on June 12th. In other news, Valve is not worried about the recent Team Fortress and CS:GO leaks since they are from older versions of the game, and have no effect on the 2020 builds. Battlefield V has one more update on the way but a lot more community-oriented events are in the works this summer.

## The Horrifying True Story Behind The Dark Pictures: Little Hope

Little Hope is the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology, following Man of Medan. That game was based on a sunken Indonesian ship, the Ourang Medan, and Little Hope is likewise based on a true story. Its New England setting may bring the Salem Witch Trials to mind, but that's not quite where developer Supermassive Games pulled its inspiration from.

Little Hope is actually based on the often overlooked Andover Witch Trials, which occurred north of Salem. Tony dives into the history of these events in the video above, explaining how they're deadlier than the stories often taught in history class.

Little Hope itself has no specific release date, but it's slated for PS4, Xbox One, and PC this summer. Pre-orders are open now.

## 6 Essential Changes In XCOM: Chimera Squad You'll Need To Learn Fast

In a surprise twist, Firaxis revealed the next XCOM game is not, in fact, XCOM 3. Though it's neither a direct sequel to or expansion of XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad takes place after the events of the previous games. After getting our hands on the spin-off, we've discovered that Firaxis has changed plenty about XCOM's traditional formula.

In the video above, Aaron Sampson goes over six essential tips for succeeding in Chimera Squad. As mentioned before, even if you're a long-time fan of the series, you'll have to consider different mechanics and features if you hope to succeed in Chimera Squad. There's a new breaching phase at the start of every fight, for example, and turn order has been reworked.

Chimera Squad encourages you to make additional considerations outside of combat too. As XCOM's permadeath mode doesn't make a return, managing civil unrest becomes a significantly higher priority to preventing a game over. Your squadmates can be injured as well, and you'll have to let them rest or send them off to do some physical therapy training in order to heal.

XCOM: Chimera Squad releases for PC on April 24. The game will launch on sale for $10 USD, though it will return to its original retail price of $20 USD on May 1.

Fallout 76 had a rocky launch, but with the Wastelanders update, you might be tempted to give it another shot. Here's what Jake Dekker has to say after spending 30 hours with the new update.

The long-awaited Wastelanders update comes with a number of changes, improvements, and new content. With that, you might be asking yourself: Should I give Fallout 76 another shot? GameSpot’s video producer, Jake Dekker, has spent 30 hours exploring Appalachia to help you answer that very question.

In this video, Jake goes over all the big changes introduced in Fallout 76’s Wastelanders update, including the new dialogue mechanics, the faction system, and the story. Although Fallout 76 suffers from many of the same issues it did at launch, Wastelanders seems to be a step in the right direction.

Fallout 76 Wastelanders is available now for PS4, Xbox One and PC. Stay tuned to GameSpot for Alessandro Barbosa’s full review of Wastelanders.

Trials of Mana adds modern hooks to an obscure classic JRPG, but fluid combat is held back by some frustrating choices.
