It was then that she had an idea about organising a community clap for NHS workers after seeing something similar in her home country of the Netherlands. Now, every Thursday at 8pm, millions of people head out into the streets to clap and cheer for the people risking their lives on the frontline. She tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> how one idea became a national outpouring. </p><p>The crisis is bringing people together in other ways too. <strong>Naveed Khan </strong>is using a customised vehicle to deliver food and supplies to vulnerable people across his home city of Bradford. <strong>Lucy Welling</strong>,<strong> </strong>an NHS nurse, had her bike stolen as Britain went into lockdown. But followers on social media rallied round and helped find the bike amid several offers of a new one. The episode inspired a new movement, #TourDeThanks, to offer up bikes to key workers. In Nunhead, south London, <strong>Claire Sheppard </strong>set up Nunhead Knocks to help out those living in isolation. In Sheffield, 23-year-old <strong>Sarah-Jane Clark </strong>is one of a number of colleagues who moved in to a care home to look after residents safely. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/apr/13/how-covid-19-brought-britain-back-together-podcast\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/apr/13/how-covid-19-brought-britain-back-together-podcast", "date_published": "2020-04-13 02:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Iran: Covid-19 outbreak delays investigation into downed Ukrainian flight", "description": "<p>Canada asks Tehran to delay black box data download until travel restrictions for their experts to take part are lifted</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The Covid-19 pandemic will delay the investigation into the downing of a Ukrainian international flight over Iran, after Canada asked Tehran to delay downloading data on the black boxes due to coronavirus travel restrictions.</p><p>Iran agreed in March to hand over the black boxes from Flight 752 to Ukraine or France for analysis \u2013 a move welcomed by Canada and Ukraine.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/iran-covid-19-outbreak-delays-investigation-into-downed-ukrainian-flight\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/iran-covid-19-outbreak-delays-investigation-into-downed-ukrainian-flight", "date_published": "2020-04-13 01:29:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "NBA Horse tournament: Allie Quigley beats Chris Paul \u2013 as it happened", "description": "<ul><li>ESPN hosts basketball challenge during Covid-19 lockdown</li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-13T01:01:13.187Z\">2.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>It was a rather rough going at first, but that final match showed that this idea has promise.
