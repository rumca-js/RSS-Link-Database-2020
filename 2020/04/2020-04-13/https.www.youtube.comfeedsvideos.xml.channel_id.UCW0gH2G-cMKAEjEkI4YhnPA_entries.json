Today, we cover brothers Dori, Nori, and Ori from their origins in the Blue Mountains to their post-Quest of Erebor adventures in Moria and the Battle of Dale.  Since details are scarce on some of the dwarves, we will look to the Peter Jackson adaptations for further background details.  My hope is that this will help enrich our enjoyment of these characters in The Hobbit Trilogy.\n\nHit subscribe - and the bell - so you never miss a video from Nerd of the Rings! \n\n-------------- \nAll content falls under fair use: any copying of copyrighted material done for a limited and \u201ctransformative\u201d purpose, such as to comment upon, criticize, or parody a copyrighted work.
