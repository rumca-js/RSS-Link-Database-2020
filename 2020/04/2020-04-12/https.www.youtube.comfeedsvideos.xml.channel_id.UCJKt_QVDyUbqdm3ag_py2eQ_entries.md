"Homunculi" (2020) by AceMan (Jakub Szelag), 3rd at Revision 2020 tracked music competition. Art (Ouroboros mark from FMA) by someone somewhere, the dl site didn't have further info (vippng.com). This upload is intended for headphones only.

Made using real A1200 audio. A recapped Rev 1D.4 (AWK 364720-04) mobo with resistors R321 and R331 = 680 ohms. More info about these two resistors here (RetroGameModz):

A compilation of 10 tracks from Jeff (SÃ¸ren Lund). 5 not previously featured in my channel, the rest are familiar (but worth reuploading in bx_). These are all fresh recordings from my most Jeff-like chips (based on some recordings from his own chip). However, i don't know if all these were composed using that same chip. Whatever the case is, i like these. The darker filter curve gives these some nice character (i think at least). For the pixel art i used Christopherjam palette this time (more saturated colors). Headphones recommended as always.
