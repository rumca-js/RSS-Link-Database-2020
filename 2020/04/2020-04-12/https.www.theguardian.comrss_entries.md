Long live death!” – were pronounced in 1936 by General Millán Astray, a fascist general who was a mentor and friend of Francisco Franco, soon to be Spain’s dictator for over four decades. They were part of a ranting speech Millán delivered at the University of Salamanca celebrating the insurrection against the Spanish Republic that heralded the dark years that were on the horizon.</p><p>I recalled these barbarous words with trepidation back in October of 2017 when I began tracking down the ways in which Donald Trump, in only the first 10 endless months of what was already then his endless government, was waging a disquieting war on science and the truth. In an <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/10/12/trumps-war-on-knowledge/">online essay</a> for the New York Review of Books, I warned of the “lethal consequences” that this offensive would entail, the millions of lives that would be shortened.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/i-warned-of-trumps-attack-on-science-but-i-never-predicted-the-horror-that-lay-ahead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a photographer for the Guardian, I had to choose which end to sit down at. I didn’t get it right first time </p><p>For the first time since the 1985 Heysel disaster, Liverpool were in the European Cup final and around 30,000 of their fans found their way to the outskirts of Istanbul. Milan were a daunting prospect, boasting top international pedigree in every position. Liverpool had finished a poor fifth in the league in Rafael Benítez’s first season. The team he selected that day looked weak in many places. It seemed a one-sided contest.</p><p>Well before kick-off, deep under the main stand, I chose my spot for the game. It is a well-rehearsed routine for all photographers at major games. When your name is called out you walk forwards to a map of the pitch and choose your seat. I plumped for behind the goal at the Liverpool end, where the red hordes were gathering. It’s assumed that both sides play towards their own supporters in the second half. I fancied Milan to blast Liverpool away in the first half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/my-favourite-game-liverpool-v-milan-2005-champions-league-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Keen to bake for your family or housemates, but put off by previous attempts? Here are delicious options – including some that don’t require yeast, and one that doesn’t even need an oven</p><p>In times of great uncertainty, knowing how to make your own bread and thereby feed your family, is palpably reassuring. The very act of kneading dough is calming, like Play-Doh for adults. So, of course, newbie bakers are all over social media, obsessing about “bubbling mothers” (AKA sourdough starters).</p><p>Look a little closer, though, and they’re not very happy. “We are all baking bread and some of us are not so good at it,” tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/TonyTassell/status/1245956933066076163">one journalist, dejectedly</a>. That’s because sourdough is high-maintenance baking. People write memoirs about mastering the technique. By contrast, watching Noji Gaylard making South African steamed bread (see below) is like hugging a baby. Three minutes and 30 seconds of pure calm. His recipe, alongside the others included in our 10 basic breads, is easy enough for even the most inexperienced baker.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/12/forget-sourdough-how-to-make-10-of-the-worlds-easiest-breads">Continue reading...</a>

Coronavirus deaths in the UK were in the tens, and the disease was ravaging Italy. The daily death tolls from Italy and then Spain were reported every 24 hours and the numbers were staggering, unfathomable and rising. Italy was “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/">overwhelmed</a>”, succumbing to a tragic scenario because of quarantine enforcement failures, and an inability to predict how quickly the disease would be transmitted. The highest daily death toll recorded in Italy was on 28 March, with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/uks-coronavirus-death-toll-how-accurate-is-it-and-how-does-it-compare">971 deaths</a>. Spain’s highest came five days later with 950. On Friday, the death toll in UK hospitals was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-uk-deadliest-day-deaths-announced">980</a>.</p><p>The UK is now surpassing the apocalyptic tolls we fixated on just two weeks ago. The same tragedies are unfolding across our country. Doctors and nurses are dying, exposed to heavy viral loads and often without adequate protective equipment. Covid-19 wards are saturated, echoing the calls of distress from Italian medical staff, as the specific shifts of doctors and nurses disappear and blend into one long coronavirus rota. But the sense of distress with which the Italian scenario was reported and received in the UK is strangely absent. Missing too is the urgent need to understand why this is happening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/uk-coronavirus-deaths-preventable-government-account">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Drew McIntyre is one of wrestling’s biggest stars – and his compelling real-life story is every bit as gripping as his outrageously scripted fights</p><p>I’m going to try to describe to you the general vibe of <a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars/drew-mcintyre" title="">Drew McIntyre</a>. Drew McIntyre is a <a href="https://www.wwe.com/superstars">WWE Superstar</a>. Hundreds of millions of people know this, but many others do not. This is the nature of World Wrestling Entertainment Superstardom – and Drew McIntyre is cheerfully resigned to it. He looks heavy, physically, as though it would take six or seven men – normal men – or eight or nine little weaklings like me, to lift him. Drew McIntyre could lift himself up, though, because he has the raw power of an industrial digger. He’s lounging on a sofa in front of me, pre-lockdown, a steak dinner lingering just behind him. And though he is unfailingly polite – thoughtful and sincere with just a crispy little burnt crust of humour round the edges – he does give off the energy, palpably, that he could toss the sofa he’s sitting on up in the air like a baseball and headbutt it through the adjacent wall. He is at once capable of tenderly nuzzling a small puppy and kicking someone’s head through a pub urinal – and that’s what makes him such a captivating superstar. He is hard and soft. He is meat and iron.

<p>The stage director of Fleabag on her new TV series for HBO, texting her exes, and how she writes during lockdown</p><p>Sheffield-born writer-director Vicky Jones, 41, is co-founder of <a href="https://sohotheatre.com/people/drywrite/">DryWrite Theatre Company</a>, alongside her frequent collaborator <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/phoebe-waller-bridge">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a>. She directed the original stage production of <em>Fleabag</em>, script-edited the TV version and is currently the National Theatre’s playwright in residence. Jones has written and created new HBO series <em>Run</em>, DryWrite’s first TV production, which debuts this week on Sky, starring <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/domhnall-gleeson">Domhn</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/domhnall-gleeson">all Gleeson</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/unbelievable-quiet-power-netflix-drama">Merritt Wever</a>.</p><p><strong>How did the idea for </strong><em><strong>Run</strong></em><strong> come about?<br /></strong>Me and Phoebe had a joke years ago where we’d whisper “Run!” to each other in any situation we wanted to get out of. A relationship, a social engagement, the wrong job, wrong decision… The idea being that we’d take each other’s hands, make a dash for it and keep going. It was a comforting feeling that there was always someone who’d run away with us. We never did it, never just ran off and left people hanging – except once at a festival, but that’s another story! Mostly it was just a funny idea. Years later, it morphed into this TV show.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/12/vicky-jones-fleabag-felt-like-a-tipping-point-for-feminism">Continue reading...</a>

But the explorer Steve Backshall is used to living in tough and challenging environments around the world. “I’ve spent so much of my life away in a field, sleeping in a tent, that to have this amount of time with the family at home is actually a real privilege. It’s something I don’t get very much.”</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, it takes more than a few dirty nappies to disconcert a man who is used to defecating in strange places. “Every single day, scooting off into the jungle to find a place to have a poo could be either the highlight of the day – or the worst possible moment.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/12/the-undiscovered-worlds-that-led-adventurer-steve-backshall-home">Continue reading...</a>

## 'The stakes were really high': the stars of Normal People on bringing Sally Rooney's novel to TV

<p>Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones play Connell and Marianne in the BBC/Hulu adaptation of the phenomenal bestseller. They discuss sex scenes and millennial traits</p><p>Though fans will hope and trust that a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s <em>Normal People</em> would not shy from the novel’s sexual intimacies, it keeps us waiting a while – it is not until the second episode that undercover teenage lovers Connell and Marianne get under the covers for the first time. For a few seconds, it all seems to be going comically wrong, as her arms and her ponytail flail above her head, trapped in her pull-off bra. But then her face emerges, shiny with trust and desire, and the fireworks begin. “I love that scene,” says Daisy Edgar-Jones. “It’s so awkward. For me, it is the most representative love scene I’ve ever seen. Connell is so kind and giving and safe with her that it’s a very healthy depiction of what first-time sex can look like.”</p><p>This might make it sound a bit PG, but as her co-star Paul Mescal quickly chips in: “It’s not clinical. It’s loving and romantic and sexy because you see two minds coming together.” To describe the adaptation as hotly anticipated is an understatement. Rooney herself has co-scripted six of the episodes in collaboration with award-winning playwright and story editor on series two of HBO’s <em>Succession</em> Alice Birch, who recalls “hoovering up” the novel in a jetlagged blur and immediately emailing her agent to say she was desperate to adapt it. “I felt very emotional about those two people. I don’t often have this feeling. In our industry, we can be quite quick to enjoy a book and then immediately think about how to hack it to bits for the screen.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/12/the-stakes-were-really-high-bringing-sally-rooney-normal-people-to-tv">Continue reading...</a>

## The best low alcohol beers | David Williams

<p>Lighter beers that don’t sacrifice flavour are perfect for a virtual pint with mates</p><p><strong>The Kernel Table Beer, London</strong><strong>, (</strong><strong>from £2.50</strong><strong> (3</strong><strong>3cl), </strong><strong><a href="https://store.thekernelbrewery.com/" title="">the Kernel Brewery</a>, </strong><strong><a href="https://shop.vinoteca.co.uk/" title="">Vinoteca</a>, </strong><strong><a href="https://www.capsandtaps.co.uk/" title="">Caps and Taps</a>, </strong><strong><a href="https://store.claptoncraft.co.uk/" title="">Clapton Craft</a>) </strong>A new situation, at least for me: the Zoom/Skype/Google Hangout pint. Whether or not the novelty of this particular lockdown activity has worn off by the time you read this (and time is up to funny tricks at the moment), the beers I’m choosing this week are all ideal for gentle diversion in the best and worst of times in real or virtual pubs: low in alcohol, high in taste. First up is a beer that has been among my favourites for lunchtime drinking for some years now. Made in the Kernel’s railway arch brewery, a pioneering south London craft brewer, Table Beer (so much nicer as a phrase than ‘session’) clocks in with an ABV of around 3% depending on the batch, and has a brisk citrus-and-mineral freshness coupled with refreshing bitterness and some surprisingly mouthfilling tropical fruit.</p><p><strong>Small Beer Steam, London (from £2.25 (35cl), <a href="https://theoriginalsmallbeer.com/store" title="">Small Beer Brew Co</a>, <a href="https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/45242/the-original-small-beer-steam-single-bottle" title="">the Whisky Exchange</a>, <a href="https://greatwesternwine.co.uk/" title="">Great Western Wines</a>) </strong>The Kernel’s cult classic is by no means the only modern craft ale to hit a brewing bullseye where flavour and palate-weight comes without head-pounding alcoholic power. It’s not even the only one in Bermondsey. Looking back to the 18th century, when the production of very low-alcohol ‘small’ beers was widespread as a safer alternative to dirty drinking water for the whole family, Small Beer produces a set of sub-3% brews. The 2.5% ABV Session Pale has a lip-smacking citrus zestiness that works in a similar way to a dry white wine such as picpoul de pinet as both aperitif and with, say, tempura prawns. For those hankering after a maltier, darker classic pint of bitter, the 2.7% ABV Steam is a satisfying drink with the length and bitterness of a much stronger beer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/12/david-williams-best-lower-alcohol-beers-for-virtual-hangout-catchup-with-mates">Continue reading...</a>

Root crops, too, though we will stick to radishes, beetroot, perhaps turnips if we can find room. We don’t tend to do well with carrots. It is time to finish planting potatoes: second early and main crops can all go in now.

<p>Reiner Holzemer’s film about the media-shy Belgian designer is insightful – despite not revealing his subject’s face</p><p>This fun, nerdy follow-up to Reiner Holzemer’s 2017 documentary about Dries Van Noten takes on another Belgian fashion designer, Martin Margiela. The use of the notoriously media-shy Margiela’s warm, serious spoken voice helps to create intimacy, even though we never see his face. “I don’t like the idea of being a celebrity; anonymity is very important to me,” he says, and so Holzemer simply shows us his hands. Fitting, given the man’s style philosophy is all about silhouette – “the shoulder” and “the shoe”. As a child, Margiela would cut off the toes of his Barbies’ shoes, an interesting detail that foreshadows the legacy of the cloven Tabi boots he brought to the runway in the 1980s.<br />• <em>Available to <a href="https://www.martinmargielafilm.co.uk/watch-at-home">stream </a>via Curzon Home Cinema and on iTunes</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/12/martin-margiela-in-his-own-words-review-philosopher-of-fashion">Continue reading...</a>
