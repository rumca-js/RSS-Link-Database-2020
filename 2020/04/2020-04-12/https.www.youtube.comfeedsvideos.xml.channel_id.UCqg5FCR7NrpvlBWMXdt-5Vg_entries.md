Welcome to the series premiere of Slightly Civil War, a humorous video game debate show featuring Yahtzee Croshaw and Jack Packard!

Inspired by the fan-favorite Escapist show, Uncivil War, Yahtzee and Jack will be randomly assigned a position on a contentious video game topic and head to battle to make their point. This week is about difficulty settings in games like Dark Souls.

Episodes will air each week on Monday at noon EDT and the following Monday on YouTube.

There will also be a companion podcast for the show where Yahtzee and Jack discuss their true thoughts on the subject debated in the video.
