This performance was recorded on Feb. 28, 2020. We will continue releasing Tiny Desk videos of shows that had already been taped. In light of current events, NPR is postponing new live tapings of Tiny Desk Concerts. In the meantime, check out Tiny Desk (home) concerts! They’re recorded by the artists in their home. It’s the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

April 6, 2020 | Josh Rogosin -- The Lumineers showed up at the Tiny Desk with family, friends and crew who travel with the tight-knit touring band. One special guest in particular was Lenny, the toddler son of lead singer Wes Schultz. As soon as Bob Boilen met Lenny, Bob searched for every toy he could find on the shelves behind his desk to entertain the restless tyke.

I've always been struck by how this band can make a crowd of 6,000 fans feel like an intimate jam session. Halfway through The Lumineers' set at the Newport Folk Festival in 2013, the entire band moved to the very back of the enormous crowd. I remember marveling that the worst spot in the field miraculously became the best.

Much of The Lumineers' Tiny Desk comes from the band's third LP, III, which tells a story of addiction in three acts. They began with gut-wrenching renditions of "Gloria" and "Leader Of The Landslide"(accompanied by a cassette recording of crickets made on iPhones and dubbed to play on a boombox). The third track is also from III, but was an assignment from director M. Night Shyamalan. He tasked Schultz and his suspender-clad writing partner, Jeremiah Fraites, with composing a song for the end credits of a film. "Jer and I worked really hard on that, and then he didn't need it," Schultz confessed. The result is the stark and haunting "Salt And The Sea,"which strikes a different chord than any other song they've written.

It wouldn't be a Lumineers show without a foot-stompin' sing-along to end the set, which came with their crowd-pleasing hit "Stubborn Love". Stelth Ulvang demonstrated a level of barefoot acrobatics unrivaled at the desk thus far, not an easy feat (or should I say, feet). Right after the Tiny Desk concert, the band and entourage rushed off to play a little club in town called the Capital One Arena for another intimate show in front of 20,000 fans.

We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Bob Boilen | January 10, 2010

Four years ago, I dug Adam Arcuragi's CD out a stack of many and was struck by his voice: powerful, but without the unnecessary melodrama that encumbers so many talented singers.

Then there was the poetry. All you have to do is read the title to the first Arcuragi song we put on All Songs Considered, titled "1981 (Or Waving at You As We Part at Light Speed Will Look Like I'm Standing Still)." His recent recording, I Am Become Joy, was just as appropriately titled; an uplifting record whose sorrow is shaken by the sound of old friends shouting at the rafters. (Only, unlike most of my friends, they can sing.)

When Arcuragi came to play at my desk, most of the folks here at NPR hadn't heard him. After hearing the three songs he played, many walked away amazed. I hope you do, too.
