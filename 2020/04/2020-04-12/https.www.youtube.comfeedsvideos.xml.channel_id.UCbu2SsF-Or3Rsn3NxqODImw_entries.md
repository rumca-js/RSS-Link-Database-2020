With Valorant's closed beta, a select few have had hands-on experience with Riot Games' first competitive FPS. We've played it ourselves, and it seems that the development team behind League of Legends has drawn a lot of inspiration from the likes of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Overwatch, and Rainbow Six Siege. But there's more to Valorant than just its influences. In this video, we break down the gameplay details and features in Valorant based on our time with the beta. 

Agents are basically heroes, all with unique sets of abilities and certain roles to fill. There's currently one mode of play, which is a five-on-five demolition mode with one team attacking and the other defending--the first team to 13 winning rounds takes the match. You purchase guns, gear, and powers each round, and have to factor an economic element when determining what equipment to buy. We also look at the features outside of gameplay and take a peek at the store to see what microtransactions are like.

We have another video you can check out which dives deeper into our overall impressions of Valorant's gameplay experience. Valorant is set to launch sometime in the Summer this year, so be sure to stick to GameSpot for more on the game.

A game being awarded a 10/10 is a rarity for GameSpot, and only a small handful of titles have received the prestigious award in the site's long history. Final Fantasy VII Remake is the latest to be inducted into the exclusive hall of fame and, if you've read our review of the game or watched the video review, you'll understand why.

In our review, Final Fantasy VII Remake was described as a reimagining of a beloved tale that marries top-notch storytelling with a smart mashup of action and RPG gameplay to deliver a must-play experience. 

During the GameSpot After Dark podcast Jake Dekker, Jean-Luc Seipke, and Lucy James talked to reviewer Tamoor Hussain a bit more about why he feels FF7R is an "Essential" game, by GameSpot's standards.

The discussion is spoiler-free and touches upon the world, combat, narrative, characterization, music, and more. There are multiple perspectives represented in the conversation, ranging from fans of the original to complete newcomers that are planning to play when it's available. Watch for an in-depth breakdown of how Final Fantasy VII Remake earns its 10.
