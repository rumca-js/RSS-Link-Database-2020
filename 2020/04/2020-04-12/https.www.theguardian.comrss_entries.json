Coronavirus deaths in the UK were in the tens, and the disease was ravaging Italy. The daily death tolls from Italy and then Spain were reported every 24 hours and the numbers were staggering, unfathomable and rising. Italy was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/14/italians-80-will-left-die-country-overwhelmed-coronavirus/\">overwhelmed</a>\u201d, succumbing to a tragic scenario because of quarantine enforcement failures, and an inability to predict how quickly the disease would be transmitted. The highest daily death toll recorded in Italy was on 28 March, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/uks-coronavirus-death-toll-how-accurate-is-it-and-how-does-it-compare\">971 deaths</a>. Spain\u2019s highest came five days later with 950. On Friday, the death toll in UK hospitals was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-uk-deadliest-day-deaths-announced\">980</a>.</p><p>The UK is now surpassing the apocalyptic tolls we fixated on just two weeks ago. The same tragedies are unfolding across our country. Doctors and nurses are dying, exposed to heavy viral loads and often without adequate protective equipment. Covid-19 wards are saturated, echoing the calls of distress from Italian medical staff, as the specific shifts of doctors and nurses disappear and blend into one long coronavirus rota. But the sense of distress with which the Italian scenario was reported and received in the UK is strangely absent. Missing too is the urgent need to understand why this is happening.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/uk-coronavirus-deaths-preventable-government-account\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/12/uk-coronavirus-deaths-preventable-government-account", "date_published": "2020-04-12 12:46:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Poem constructed from emails received during quarantine goes viral", "description": "<p>Jessica Salfia\u2019s widely shared poem First Lines of Emails I\u2019ve Received While Quarantining has the refrain \u2018As you know, many people are struggling\u2019</p><p>Everyone has received at least one and now they\u2019ve been elevated to poetry: a US teacher has highlighted corporate opportunism during the coronavirus outbreak, in a viral poem titled First Lines of Emails I\u2019ve Received While Quarantining.</p><p>Jessica Salfia, an English teacher and writer in West Virginia, posted the poem on Twitter on Saturday. \u201cIn these uncertain times / as we navigate the new normal, / Are you willing to share your ideas and solutions?

Drew McIntyre is a <a href=\"https://www.wwe.com/superstars\">WWE Superstar</a>. Hundreds of millions of people know this, but many others do not. This is the nature of World Wrestling Entertainment Superstardom \u2013 and Drew McIntyre is cheerfully resigned to it. He looks heavy, physically, as though it would take six or seven men \u2013 normal men \u2013 or eight or nine little weaklings like me, to lift him. Drew McIntyre could lift himself up, though, because he has the raw power of an industrial digger. He\u2019s lounging on a sofa in front of me, pre-lockdown, a steak dinner lingering just behind him. And though he is unfailingly polite \u2013 thoughtful and sincere with just a crispy little burnt crust of humour round the edges \u2013 he does give off the energy, palpably, that he could toss the sofa he\u2019s sitting on up in the air like a baseball and headbutt it through the adjacent wall. He is at once capable of tenderly nuzzling a small puppy and kicking someone\u2019s head through a pub urinal \u2013 and that\u2019s what makes him such a captivating superstar. He is hard and soft. He is meat and iron. There\u2019s a lot going on with him.</p><p>Earlier this year, McIntyre became the first Briton to win WWE\u2019s Royal Rumble, a wrestling centrepiece event where dozens of the organisation\u2019s storylines converge in a 30-man brawl from which a sole winner emerges. Meanwhile millions of wrestling fans all over the world stay at home watching late into the night, elbow-dropping their furniture in jubilation.

Whether or not the novelty of this particular lockdown activity has worn off by the time you read this (and time is up to funny tricks at the moment), the beers I\u2019m choosing this week are all ideal for gentle diversion in the best and worst of times in real or virtual pubs: low in alcohol, high in taste. First up is a beer that has been among my favourites for lunchtime drinking for some years now. Made in the Kernel\u2019s railway arch brewery, a pioneering south London craft brewer, Table Beer (so much nicer as a phrase than \u2018session\u2019) clocks in with an ABV of around 3% depending on the batch, and has a brisk citrus-and-mineral freshness coupled with refreshing bitterness and some surprisingly mouthfilling tropical fruit.</p><p><strong>Small Beer Steam, London (from \u00a32.25 (35cl), <a href=\"https://theoriginalsmallbeer.com/store\" title=\"\">Small Beer Brew Co</a>, <a href=\"https://www.thewhiskyexchange.com/p/45242/the-original-small-beer-steam-single-bottle\" title=\"\">the Whisky Exchange</a>, <a href=\"https://greatwesternwine.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Great Western Wines</a>) </strong>The Kernel\u2019s cult classic is by no means the only modern craft ale to hit a brewing bullseye where flavour and palate-weight comes without head-pounding alcoholic power. It\u2019s not even the only one in Bermondsey. Looking back to the 18th century, when the production of very low-alcohol \u2018small\u2019 beers was widespread as a safer alternative to dirty drinking water for the whole family, Small Beer produces a set of sub-3% brews. The 2.5% ABV Session Pale has a lip-smacking citrus zestiness that works in a similar way to a dry white wine such as picpoul de pinet as both aperitif and with, say, tempura prawns. For those hankering after a maltier, darker classic pint of bitter, the 2.7% ABV Steam is a satisfying drink with the length and bitterness of a much stronger beer.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/12/david-williams-best-lower-alcohol-beers-for-virtual-hangout-catchup-with-mates\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/apr/12/david-williams-best-lower-alcohol-beers-for-virtual-hangout-catchup-with-mates", "date_published": "2020-04-12 06:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Going cap in hand to the Bank is going to become a way of life at the Treasury", "description": "The Bank of England\u2019s extension of the \u2018ways and means\u2019 facility adds to a mountain of loans too big to be temporary<p>Rishi Sunak avoided calling the Bank of England last week to beg for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\" title=\"\">an extension of the Treasury\u2019s overdraft facility</a> to meet his Covid-19 spending commitments.</p><p>The chancellor was saved that job by Andrew Bailey, the central bank\u2019s governor, who saw the red flashing signs on the side of the Treasury\u2019s headquarters from his Threadneedle Street offices almost three miles away.
