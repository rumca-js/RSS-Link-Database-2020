<p>Twisty plots and tough subject matter come together, as Lennie James’s excellent drama about a father’s quest to find his missing daughter returns</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lennie-james">Lennie James</a>’s excellent, bleak drama Save Me made a strong impression when it arrived in early 2018. James wrote the series and starred as Nelly, a local barfly and ladies’ man whose lackadaisical approach to life was upended when his estranged daughter Jody went missing. While it had the qualities of a solid thriller, as Nelly was drawn deeper and deeper into a criminal underworld that eventually led him to discover a grim sex-trafficking ring, it had more subtle layers beneath, and was particularly good on class conflict. In a TV landscape where it can seem as if every character has a massive, luxurious house or flat, no matter what job they supposedly do, it was refreshing and welcome to see stories told about people who live on estates, and ones which were not just about the fact that they live on estates at that.</p><p>The final episode, however, did not quite provide the resolution that many viewers craved, as Jody’s whereabouts remained unknown. So here we are with Save Me Too (Sky Atlantic), picking up the story 17 months later. It is Nelly’s 50th birthday, and his friends at The Palm Tree are throwing him a surprise party. In this show, even the prospect of a boozy party is appealing, since it has one of the best casts on television, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/stephen-graham">Stephen Graham</a> as Nelly’s mate Melon, to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/kerry-godliman">Kerry Godliman</a> as his ex, Teens, and Susan Lynch as the pub landlady, Stace. At this point, adding Oscar-nominated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/lesley-manville">Lesley Manville</a> to proceedings, as the wife of trafficker Gideon Charles (a chilling Adrian Edmondson), is just showing off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/01/save-me-too-review-a-gripping-thriller-with-emotional-heft">Continue reading...</a>

## Hunting, meth and big cats: Tiger King's rarely seen version of southern queerness

<p>Who could have guessed that a mullet-wearing, polyamorous exotic animal owner would become TV’s most talked-about gay star?</p><p>In the early 2000s, the most popular queer characters on TV were Jack McFarland and Will Truman of the sitcom Will &amp; Grace. Will and Jack were so beloved, Vice-President Joe Biden once theorized the show had <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/will-grace-real-life-political-impact-marriage-equality/">played a major role in shifting views on marriage equality</a>. The characters were also the start of a trope that would prevail on TV for years: the cosmopolitan gay male. The image would live on in shows such as Queer as Folk, Looking, and the reality competitions Project Runway and America’s Next Top Model. Who could imagine that 20 years on, a mullet-wearing, gay, polyamorous exotic animal owner from rural Oklahoma would become TV’s biggest talked about gay star?</p><p>Joe Exotic, the eccentric subject of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series">Netflix docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness</a>, has amassed a fervent following in the short time since the show’s premiere on Friday. The rapper Cardi B <a href="https://people.com/music/cardi-b-start-gofundme-tiger-king-joe-exotic/">live-tweeted</a> her reactions and expressed a desire to start a GoFundMe campaign for Mr Exotic, whose full name Wikipedia gives as Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (né Schreibvogel). Fans have taken to dressing up as Joe, slapping on fake handlebar mustaches and blond mullet wigs. And actors such as Dax Shepard and Jared Leto are pitching themselves to play the gun-loving zookeeper in a <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/celeb-tiger-king-fans-fighting-over-roles-in-future-movie/">forthcoming scripted miniseries</a>. Amid the anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, we are finding humor and relief in an imperfect, self-described “redneck” queer who owns more than 200 tigers. He’s the furthest cry from the affable, anodyne queer men who typically win America over, such as Cam and Mitchell of Modern Family and the “gay best friend” cast of Queer Eye. But unlikely times call for an unlikely hero.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-southern-queerness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Coronavirus might have stopped dramas like Line of Duty in their tracks, but with Small Axe, Us and Normal People, Wenger is pressing on – ignoring critics who claim his shows are too ‘woke’ </p><p>These are trying times for the BBC. The government talks about abolishing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-licence-fee">licence fee</a>. Certain newspapers compete to haul the programme makers over the coals for various crimes, from “woke” casting to “mucking around” with classics. There are rumours of declining ratings and mutterings about the muscle of Netflix and Amazon. Add to that a pandemic that has forced some of the corporation’s biggest dramas – including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/mar/23/it-makes-you-go-oh-my-god-how-line-of-duty-broke-the-laws-of-police-shows">Line of Duty</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/20/brad-pitt-snoop-dogg-asap-rocky-peaky-blinders-steven-knight-gangster-series">Peaky Blinders</a> – to cease production and it would be no surprise to find Piers Wenger in a pessimistic mood. In fact, the opposite is true.</p><p>“It’s been a really mad time,” says the head of BBC drama. “But it’s also been inspiring in terms of the ingenuity creators, producers and casts are showing to get their shows on screen.” He’s been holding “daily calls to talk about the longer term impact this crisis will have on the kind of story audiences are most in need of”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/31/bbc-drama-coronavirus-interview-piers-wenger">Continue reading...</a>

Despite heroic efforts to increase supply – and reduce demand – there may come a point when this tsunami will simply overwhelm intensive-care beds, ventilators and life-support machines. Although we hope this will not be happen, it is important we begin to think now about how we would respond should that situation arise. As in Spain and Italy, heart-wrenching decisions may need to be made, agonising choices about who gets access to life-saving interventions. Should there be a disjunction between need and resource, these decisions will become unavoidable. The question is how do we ensure decisions made are ethical?</p><p>Looking ahead to the coming weeks, if hard choices are required, we know they will be contested.

<p>The humble eight-holed work boot has won over everyone from postal workers to punks, teens to today’s celebrities and influencers. How did it stride to world dominance?</p><p><br />Tony Benn wore them. So did Agyness Deyn. Suggs loved them, also <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jul/02/kathleen-hanna-im-a-punk-rock-stripper-with-sexual-abuse-counsellor-training">Kathleen Hanna</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/joestrummer">Joe Strummer</a>. And <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/apr/17/my-so-called-life">Jordan Catalano</a>. Hailey Baldwin, Rihanna and Bella Hadid still do. Once you start looking, Dr Martens are everywhere. Sixty years after launching the eight-hole 1460 boot – on, as the name suggests, the 1 April 1960 – it is an undisputed classic, one of those rare-as-hen’s-teeth designs that is as likely to be spotted in a museum as it is (until recently, of course) on the streets outside. It is up there with Levi’s 501s, the Fred Perry polo shirt, the Converse All Star and the Harrington jacket.</p><p>And, like these other items, the 1460 is enjoying a fashion moment beyond its classic status. Perhaps because the past decade has been so turbulent – even before we had a global pandemic to contend with – fashion has returned to the dependable. The Hadids, Baldwin and Kaia Gerber are all endorsing Dr Martens. In other words, as Vogue declared in October, they have become “model off-duty staple”. While the vegan range and patterned designs have been credited with a 70% rise in profit for the brand in 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/aug/17/oh-so-pretty-political-upheaval-credited-for-dr-martens-sales-boost">the 1460 remains the bestseller</a> and it is this history that is likely to have attracted rumours in March of a potential £300m sale to a US private equity firm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/apr/01/carpe-dm-60-years-of-the-dr-martens-boot-fashions-subversive-smash-hit">Continue reading...</a>
