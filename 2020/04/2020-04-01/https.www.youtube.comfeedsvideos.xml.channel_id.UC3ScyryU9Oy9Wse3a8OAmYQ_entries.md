For years, the National Rifle Association wielded its political power to dominate America’s conversation about gun rights and gun control — outlasting and overpowering the calls for change that followed mass shooting after mass shooting, from Columbine to Newtown to Charleston.

But as the 2020 election approaches, the once-unrivaled organization is facing both internal strife and a rising external threat: a movement led by student survivors of the Parkland mass shooting, whose gun-control advocacy has kept the issue in the headlines and motivated a groundswell of politicians willing to take on the NRA.

#RecyclingDocumentary #PlasticWars #frontlinePBS

Despite efforts spreading across America to reduce the use of plastic and the crisis of ocean pollution growing, the plastics industry is rapidly scaling up new production and promoting a familiar solution: recycling. But it’s estimated that no more than 10% of plastic produced has ever been recycled. The documentary “Plastic Wars,” from FRONTLINE and NPR, reveals how plastic makers for decades have publicly promoted recycling, despite privately expressing doubts that widespread plastic recycling would ever be economically viable.
