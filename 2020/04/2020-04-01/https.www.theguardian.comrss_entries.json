James wrote the series and starred as Nelly, a local barfly and ladies\u2019 man whose lackadaisical approach to life was upended when his estranged daughter Jody went missing. While it had the qualities of a solid thriller, as Nelly was drawn deeper and deeper into a criminal underworld that eventually led him to discover a grim sex-trafficking ring, it had more subtle layers beneath, and was particularly good on class conflict. In a TV landscape where it can seem as if every character has a massive, luxurious house or flat, no matter what job they supposedly do, it was refreshing and welcome to see stories told about people who live on estates, and ones which were not just about the fact that they live on estates at that.</p><p>The final episode, however, did not quite provide the resolution that many viewers craved, as Jody\u2019s whereabouts remained unknown.
