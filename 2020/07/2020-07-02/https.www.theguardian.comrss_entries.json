In that sense, what happened here today doesn\u2019t matter. But Liverpool will be at least slightly miffed at being dismantled by their nearest rivals, especially as they contributed to their own defeat with some uncharacteristically shambolic defending Gomez and Robertson were all over the shop, and Man\u00e9 and Firmino were ragged up front. City were technically excellent at times, with De Bruyne, Sterling and Foden all excellent and Rodri a constant influence. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how Liverpool react to this: shrug it off and let the rest of the season fizzle out? Or come back and annihilate poor old Aston Villa on Sunday?
