GameSpot\u2019s Michael Higham was able to play for two hours ahead of the official announcement and is joined by Tony Wilson to tell you about the game\u2019s weapons, abilities, revives, and unique way to win. Hyper Scape distinguishes itself from other battle royale games with a few fresh takes on typical genre tropes and mechanics. \n\nHyper Scape\u2019s combat feels like an arena shooter with high mobility and mechanics like a double jump and jump pads on the map. You get to pick from a roster of characters that only make a difference cosmetically and with voice lines. You can build a loadout around hacks which are abilities that can be picked up around the map and give players powers such as forming a wall, invisibility, or allowing them to turn into something like a hamster ball and leap great heights. When you die in this battle royale you remain invisible and must find your way to where an enemy is killed by your team in order to be revived. You are never out permanently as long as your team is alive. The map also doesn\u2019t have a closing circle, instead, it has districts that shut down as the match progresses. The game also has a crown that allows one of the final teams to win by surviving a countdown without having to be the last one standing. \n\nHyper Scape is coming to PC.

But while Mortal Shell is just as punishing as Dark Souls (and, seemingly, just as careful with its worldbuilding and stingy with its story details), it offers some new ideas to the formula From has popularized to bring some new challenges.\n\nWe played a short preview build of Mortal Sell, which gave us a sense of its Souls-like combat--check it out in the video above. You have a lot of similar abilities to Souls games, like dodge rolls and parries, as well as a devastating riposte attack that's almost exactly like Bloodborne's Visceral Attack. But Mortal Shell changes things up with two additions: the \"harden\" ability, which allows you to turn yourself to stone and weather an attack, either to stagger an enemy or get in close for a strike of your own; and the \"shells,\" which are character bodies you can switch between to make use of their different strengths and weaknesses.\n\nOur time with Mortal Shell gave us a chance to try out two different shells and two different weapons, while engaging in a bunch of combat with various enemies. The preview build culminates in a big, climactic boss fight. If you're a fan of the Souls games, Mortal Shell should scratch the same itch, while adding new ways to overcome challenges.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3pCPZVW09s", "date_published": "2020-07-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Outriders Livestream: New Environments, Pyromancer Deep Dive, And More", "description": "On the Beyond The Frontier broadcast for Outriders we get a look at some new environments, see the structure of the game, and get a deeper look at the Pyromancer class.
