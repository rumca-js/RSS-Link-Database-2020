In that sense, what happened here today doesn’t matter. But Liverpool will be at least slightly miffed at being dismantled by their nearest rivals, especially as they contributed to their own defeat with some uncharacteristically shambolic defending Gomez and Robertson were all over the shop, and Mané and Firmino were ragged up front. City were technically excellent at times, with De Bruyne, Sterling and Foden all excellent and Rodri a constant influence. It’ll be interesting to see how Liverpool react to this: shrug it off and let the rest of the season fizzle out? Or come back and annihilate poor old Aston Villa on Sunday? There’ll be personnel changes for that game, I’ll wager.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-07-02T21:09:49.097Z">10.09pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p>NO GOAL!

<p>José Mourinho rightly condemned the damage being done to “the beautiful game” by VAR but he has more to fear than the killjoys of Stockley Park on the evidence of Tottenham’s defeat at Sheffield United. Mentally, defensively and creatively, Spurs were second best and are in danger of finishing outside the top six for the first time since 2009.</p><p>Mourinho attacked the VAR decision that disallowed an equaliser for Harry Kane at Bramall Lane, naturally, but he did not camouflage its impact on his brittle players. Spurs lost their composure and fight after Michael Oliver’s decision and were sliced apart by Chris Wilder’s wing‑backs as United leap-frogged the visitors in the pursuit of European qualification. All three of United’s goals came from the flanks and on all three occasions the Spurs defence was found wanting badly. Oli McBurnie, who sealed victory, embodied the heart and commitment that his opponents lacked.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/02/sheffield-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Most in his job end up sounding like headteachers but Williamson is stuck at floundering sixth-former</p><p>You would have thought that schools would have been fairly high up the list of the government’s priorities when lockdown was introduced back in March. That having millions of children stuck at home, reliant on online lessons and parental supervision to keep up with their schoolwork, might have raised a red flag or two at the Department for Education.</p><p>Instead, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, and his team of ministers chose to take the lockdown as an extended furlough period. Only, unlike many others in the country, he was still on full pay as he caught up with old episodes of Pointless. So he was taken completely by surprise when the first few year groups returned to class at the beginning of June only to find that most schools were unable to comply with social distancing rules without turning large numbers of children away. Gav had had one job and he had blown it. But then, like most members of Boris Johnson’s cabinet, he was chosen for his inability rather than his ability.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/02/gavs-brilliant-back-to-school-plan-pretend-the-pandemics-as-good-as-over">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scotland is right to mandate masks or similar coverings in shops. Wearing them can save lives</p><p>Wicked. Horrific. An affront to British liberties. Proposals to make <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2008/aug/01/nationalarchives.police" title="">wearing seatbelts</a> compulsory were <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8243841.stm" title="">angrily opposed</a> in the early 1970s. Some warned that it might make motorists more reckless, or endanger unborn babies. MPs claimed there was no real evidence of the benefits. Others complained it would be uncomfortable for women or the elderly. It took years of political battle to change the law, saving tens of thousands of lives.</p><p>In retrospect, the outrage looks not merely mistaken but utterly bizarre. Wearing a seatbelt is simply a matter of course now. Yet similar claims have been heard in this pandemic when it comes to wearing masks. The World Health Organization insisted there was not enough evidence to recommend their routine use, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/who-changes-advice-medical-grade-masks-over-60s" title="">changing its advice</a> only last month. Other officials warned that mask-wearers might be lulled into a false sense of security, and would fail to distance themselves from others. There was real and understandable concern that mass purchases would leave no protection for medics and other frontline workers who desperately needed it. But this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/coronavirus-face-masks.html" title="">disparagement</a> of masks may have come at a cost.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/the-guardian-view-on-protecting-the-public-cover-your-face">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With festival season cancelled, we’re starting a new series asking stars for their dream lineups. First up is Rufus Wainwright, blending opera and Florence Welch</p><p>I am a big fan of Venice and my husband and I have spent quite a bit of time there. Even when it’s teeming with tourists – which it won’t be now – I find it gloriously enthralling, so my festival would simply have to be there. Everyone would ride gondolas so we’d all be socially distanced and there would be a beautiful band show on one of the islands. It would be kinda like going to a drive-in, but a boat-in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/02/socially-distanced-venetian-gondolas-rufus-wainwright-on-his-dream-festival">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From First Dates to a glut of new Netflix releases, TV continues to woo us with a constant stream of couples dating, marrying – and even breaking up</p><p>This summer, Netflix is sticking to the old television adage of “it ain’t broke, endlessly reproduce it in a slightly different format until it is.” After the runaway success of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/25/love-is-blind-netflixs-hit-is-dating-tv-at-its-most-awful-and-compelling">Love Is Blind</a> and the viral infamy of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/29/cold-comfort-why-netflix-too-hot-to-handle-failed-to-ignite">Too Hot to Handle</a>, the streaming service is bombarding viewers with romantic reality shows. Tomorrow sees the release of Say I Do, a series that sees couples getting married at their surprise dream weddings, in a similar vein to BBC Three’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/28/dont-tell-the-bride">Don’t Tell the Bride</a>. Indian Matchmaking will also be airing, from 16 July, following marriage consultant Sima Taparia and her clients, while Love on the Spectrum, a four-part documentary that follows young adults with autism who are looking for love, begins on 22 July.</p><p>However, far from overestimating our capacity for watching romance, Netflix’s new releases appear to be shrewd ones. Despite millennials’ alleged disinterest in love (<a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/05/27/as-millennials-near-40-theyre-approaching-family-life-differently-than-previous-generations/">more than half </a><a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/05/27/as-millennials-near-40-theyre-approaching-family-life-differently-than-previous-generations/"> of us are </a><a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2020/05/27/as-millennials-near-40-theyre-approaching-family-life-differently-than-previous-generations/">unmarried</a>), we can’t seem to get enough of it on TV. Shows about love are, in a strange sense, my generation’s romcoms. These are shows filled with tender moments, misunderstandings and hi-jinks, but often less concerned with happy endings – most of the best-loved programmes are as much about destroying love as they are about finding it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/02/love-is-on-the-air-why-we-cant-get-enough-of-romantic-reality-shows">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain can't protect Hong Kong from China – but it can do right by its people | Simon Jenkins

<p>To think we can sway authoritarian Beijing is fantasy. Instead we must make those who want freedom welcome in the UK</p><p>The sight of young people anywhere being <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/hong-kongs-security-laws-usher-in-new-era-of-chinese-control">brutally stripped of their freedom</a> is depressing. When that freedom was a legacy, however brief, from the British crown, it is more so. The ban on dissent now imposed by China on Hong Kong smashes the spirit and letter of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-British_Joint_Declaration">Sino-British treaty of 1984</a>. It shows China for what it is, an unprincipled dictatorship. </p><p>When I reported in 1997 on the Hong Kong celebrations bidding farewell to British rule, there was one question on all lips. It was: how long would Beijing’s 50-year pledge of “one nation, two systems” survive? The guesses were five years, perhaps 10. China would surely milk the cash cow for all it was worth, but any sign of trouble and Beijing would instantly wipe this “imperialist pimple” off the map. No one dreamed China’s patience would last 23 years.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/02/britain-hong-kong-from-china-beijing-freedom-uk">Continue reading...</a>

<p>NFL players kneeling in the US and Premier League stars speaking out in the UK is nothing new: sportsmen and women have always been at the forefront of the fight for civil rights<br /></p><p>We may never know why Jake Hepple, a now unemployed welder from Burnley, thought it was a good idea to hire a plane and have it trail a banner reading “White Lives Matter Burnley” across the skies over Manchester’s Etihad Stadium. What we are assured is that Hepple – who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/24/white-lives-matter-plane-organiser-says-police-have-offered-protection">has been pictured</a> with his arm wrapped round the shoulder of the English Defence League’s former leader Tommy Robinson, and whose girlfriend was sacked from her job last week, accused of posting racist material on social media (her mother has said her daughter did not write the posts) – was not motivated by any form of racism. After all, he told reporters: “I’ve got lots of black and Asian friends.”</p><p>The phrase “white lives matter” is, of course, an attack on the phrase “black lives matter” and the movement that coalesced around it. But while one is a plea for equality, the other, along with the phrase “all lives matter”, was created by those who engage in the pantomime of pretending that anyone is suggesting <em>only</em> black lives matter. These people belong to the same demographic as those who think structural racism doesn’t exist, or that black people should “get over” slavery. And to that demographic, top-flight football’s support of Black Lives Matter really rankles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/02/muhammad-ali-colin-kaepernick-proud-history-black-protest-in-sport">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Paolo Sorrentino, Pablo Larraín, Maggie Gyllenhaal and other film-makers on the restrictions, inspirations and creative solutions to shooting in lockdown</p><p>“Shall we take a tour of the Vatican?” the Pope asks the Queen. Except his holiness and her majesty are not actually in the Vatican, they are in the home of the renowned Italian film-maker <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/paolo-sorrentino-my-characters-struggles-are-the-struggles-i-have">Paolo Sorrentino</a>. And they’re not actually people; they are little figurines with waving hands, such as you would buy in a souvenir shop. Sorrentino’s bookshelves double for the Vatican library, plant pots for its gardens, the underside of a chair for a grand hall. Then the Dude from the Big Lebowski pops up and tells them there’s a lockdown. “Oh, that’s quite all right,” replies the Queen. “I’ve been in lockdown for the past 94 years.”</p><p>It is a bit of a departure from Sorrentino’s usual sumptuous works such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review">The Great Beauty</a> or his HBO series <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law">The New Pope</a> (which is set in a considerably more lifelike replica Vatican). But this is what film-making looks like under lockdown. Sorrentino shot the film on his iPhone, then got actors Javier Cámara and Olivia Williams to do the voiceovers. “It was a sort of return to the beginning of my life as a director,” he says. “When I was very young, I did exactly this kind of stuff: making movies alone at home with a VHS camera.” The Pope and Queen figurines usually sit on his desk. “They are both people who have lived their whole lives in lockdown,” he says, “so it was easy to tell a story of solitude, of melancholy between them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/02/i-had-this-image-of-my-husband-making-love-to-a-tree-directors-on-filming-shorts-for-netflixs-homemade">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jamaica’s reggae megastar received a hero’s welcome when he came home after seven years in a US jail. ‘No guts, no glory – that’s my genesis,’ he says in a rare interview </p><p>At the end of 2018, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/reggae">reggae</a> star Buju Banton returned to Jamaica after almost seven years in a US prison, and Norman Manley international airport was mobbed. His flight was delayed, the chants of “We want Buju” ramped up, then after a brief prayer huddle in the customs area, he pushed into the arrivals hall to pandemonium. It took a phalanx of hi-vis-wearing airport workers to hustle him through to the waiting police motorcade, a task not helped by the workers’ attempts to get selfies with their charge.</p><p>It was a hero’s welcome because, despite being convicted in the US of intention to distribute cocaine, Banton is a Jamaican hero. For his first post-prison concert, at Kingston’s National Stadium, about 30,000 people were packed in with many more enjoying it from outside.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/02/every-black-man-have-to-fight-buju-banton-on-prison-and-liberation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When the lockdown hit, an Asian food store in Ipswich earned a new lease of life by using Google to strengthen its online presence </p><p>In September, Go East, a family-run Asian food shop in Ipswich, celebrated its move to a larger space in the centre of the Suffolk town. Since Yixuan Cheung first opened the store in 2008, its stock of ingredients has grown from just Chinese to include food from Japan, Korea, Thailand and the Philippines. Yixuan had watched appetites soar for the specialist imported ingredients she stocked. Go East was riding high. Then came Covid-19.</p><p>Yixuan shut the store’s doors on the Friday before lockdown, and looked at the prospect of a long period without any trade – and a huge amount of perishable stock. Pre-Covid-19, like many small independent shops with brisk local trade, an online presence for Go East never seemed necessary. But with lockdown looming, it was their only hope. In three days, using a phone to take photos of stock, the Go East team created a simple website from scratch, featuring hundreds of categorised products.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/helping-small-businesses-adapt/2020/jul/02/now-were-not-scared-of-trying-something-new-the-specialist-food-store-that-kept-its-customers-by-adapting-online">Continue reading...</a>

They sound the same, yet, even without looking, you can always tell who is talking. There is something practised yet intimate about their fraternal dynamic; always at pains not to exclude the outsider, they bring you in by constantly ribbing each other. “Martin, I’m sorry, you’ve come on, but I’m talking about my new album, so we haven’t got time to say hello,” Gary opens, but I suspect them throughout of communicating with one another telepathically.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/02/martin-and-gary-kemp-most-brothers-in-music-seem-to-hate-each-other">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Combining open air with social distancing, a stay at a UK campsite will be a popular option this year. Readers reveal their favourites</p><p>Whenever people complain that the UK isn’t a holiday destination, I think of Three Cliffs Bay near Swansea. I first went as a child, and have remained in love ever since. The campsite looks over a sheltered lagoon with three rocky crags, huge sand dunes and rock faces you can scramble up. It’s a perfect campsite for families because of the facilities and surrounding nature. Apart from the incredible view, my favourite thing is how close it is to the beach – very tempting for a morning swim. I can’t wait to go back. <br />• <em>Open to caravans and motorhomes from 13 July, for camping (from £24 a night) from 1 Sept, no glamping till 2021, <a href="https://threecliffsbay.com/">threecliffsbay.com</a><br /></em><strong>Alex Smith</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/02/10-of-the-best-uk-campsites-readers-travel-tips">Continue reading...</a>

## What's wrong with WhatsApp

<p>As social media has become more inhospitable, the appeal of private online groups has grown. But they hold their own dangers – to those both inside and out.</p><p>In the spring, as the virus swept across the world and billions of people were compelled to stay at home, the popularity of one social media app <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/26/report-whatsapp-has-seen-a-40-increase-in-usage-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/" title="">rose more sharply</a> than any other. By late March, usage of WhatsApp around the world had grown by 40%. In Spain, where the lockdown was particularly strict, it rose by 76%. In those early months, WhatsApp – which hovers neatly between the space of email, Facebook and SMS, allowing text messages, links and photos to be shared between groups – was a prime conduit through which waves of news, memes and mass anxiety travelled.</p><p>At first, many of the new uses were heartening. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/mutual-aid-coronavirus-pandemic-rebecca-solnit" title="">Mutual aid groups</a> sprung up to help the vulnerable. Families and friends used the app to stay close, sharing their fears and concerns in real time. Yet by mid-April, the role that WhatsApp was playing in the pandemic looked somewhat darker. A conspiracy theory about the rollout of 5G, which originated long before Covid-19 had appeared, now claimed that mobile phone masts were responsible for the disease. Across the UK, people began <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory" title="">setting fire</a> to 5G masts, with 20 arson attacks over the Easter weekend alone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jul/02/whatsapp-groups-conspiracy-theories-disinformation-democracy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Legislation will allow Foreign Office to confront countries over human rights, but who it will target remains to be seen</p><p>New UK human rights sanctions legislation set to be published in the next few weeks is being touted as a possible tool with which to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/hong-kong-protesters-arrested-as-security-law-comes-into-effect">confront Chinese officials </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/01/hong-kong-protesters-arrested-as-security-law-comes-into-effect">over Hong Kong</a>, but questions loom about whether the law’s range and impact can meet such high expectations.</p><p>The difficulties inherent in drafting watertight sanctions is reflected in the long delay prior to its publication.

<p>Guardian US environmental justice reporter Nina Lakhani reports on her landmark investigation into America’s water crisis, revealing that millions of Americans are facing unaffordable bills for running water and risk being disconnected or losing their homes</p><p>Guardian US environmental justice reporter <strong>Nina Lakhani </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>about her water crisis investigation, which looked into why running water is becoming unaffordable for millions of Americans across the US. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/water">Water</a> bills weigh heavily on many Americans as utilities hike prices to pay for environmental clean-ups, infrastructure upgrades and climate emergency defences to deal with floods and droughts. Federal funding for America’s ageing water system has plummeted, and as a result a growing number of households are unable to afford to pay their bills.</p><p><strong>Albert Pickett</strong> inherited water debts from his mother after she died. Pickett applied to get on to a repayment plan, but the water department refused as he didn’t have the money, several hundred dollars, required as a deposit. Cleveland Water didn’t inform Pickett, who survives on disability benefits, about his right to appeal – instead, they turned off the taps in 2013. “Without water you can’t do anything. I lost my family, my wellbeing, my self-esteem. It was humiliating, like I was less than human,” he says. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jul/02/the-scandal-of-millions-of-americans-being-deprived-of-running-water-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
