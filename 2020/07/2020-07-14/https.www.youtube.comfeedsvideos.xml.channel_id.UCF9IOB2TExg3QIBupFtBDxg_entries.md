Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape

Staff on strike or sick

Perinatal deaths

Senior doctors

‘an epic failure of a deeply corrupt system’

‘institutional burn-out… a sense of chronic exploitation’

‘the department of health essentially bankrupt, and a system on its knees with no strategic management’

‘There's a huge amount of fear, and of mental and emotional fatigue’ 

‘We were working with a skeleton staff even before Covid-19 and now we're down another 30%’

Services are starting to crumble under the strain

COVID has opened up all the chronic cracks in the system

Patients had been ‘fighting for oxygen’ at Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth

‘like a war situation’

Blood and waste on the floors

Lack of Personal Protective Equipment

Oxygen shortages

Severe shortage of ambulances

No ventilation

Patients sleeping ‘under newspaper’

Rats

Senior nurse

‘Every day I come to work in fear’

‘The infection numbers are going up’

‘Every day we've got chaos’

Maternity

Lot of pregnant women all over the wards

Mothers and infants died.

‘I was personally involved in the delivery of two dead infants and know there were more. This is very unusual. To have several mummies and babies dying in one week in one hospital is totally unheard of and unacceptable’

Probably caused by lack of health care

Pregnant women, waiting for days, sometimes lying in corridors, for urgent surgery

Confirmed reports of an unusual number of stillborn infants in recent weeks

Provincial health department was generally seen as so inept and dysfunctional that private donors, businesses and charitable funds anxious to help in the fight against Covid-19 were refusing to deal directly with it

President Cyril Ramaphosa

"the storm is upon us".

10,000 Victorians attended the Black Lives Matter protest in Melbourne on June 6.

Victorian authorities issued a stern warning to people not to attend.

“We’re in the middle of a global pandemic and we’ve all come so far.”

Nine public housing towers in Melbourne were put in a hard lockdown for five days from July 4

1,800 cases of the virus are currently active in the state

Phoenix, over 100% capacity

Dr. Fauci

We haven’t even begun to see the end of it yet

36 years as director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

I don’t think it’s an exaggeration to say we have a serious ongoing problem, right now, as we speak

What worries me is the slope of the curve

It still looks like it’s exponential 

Many states started opening up before their cases got down to a baseline level where new cases could easily be tracked

I think we have to realise that some states jumped ahead of themselves. Other states did it correctly

But the citizenry didn’t listen to the guidelines and they decided they were going to stay in bars and go to congregations of crowds and celebrations

The US has always valued individual rights

This could make it hard to tackle the pandemic

A movement against science and authority

That is very, very problematic right now

Extreme confusion

I have never seen a virus or any pathogen that has such a broad range of manifestations

Even if it doesn’t kill you, even if it doesn’t put you in the hospital, it can make you seriously ill

I have a reputation, as you probably have figured out, of speaking the truth at all times and not sugar-coating things 

And that may be one of the reasons why I haven’t been on television very much lately

Prepare now for a winter COVID-19 peak, Academy of Medical Sciences, 14th July

37 excerpts

https://acmedsci.ac.uk/more/news/prepare-now-for-a-winter-covid-19-peak-warns-academy-of-medical-sciences

Preparations to avoid second wave worst-case scenario in NHS hospitals must start now

COVID-19 is more likely to spread in winter

More time indoors

Virus able to survive longer in colder, darker winter conditions.

Problems

Disruption already created

Backlog of patients

Possibility of a flu epidemic

Other infectious diseases

Asthma, heart attack, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke

Overlapping symptoms of COVID-19, flu and other winter infections

Internal redeployments

Slower with reduced throughput capacity

Risk of the health service being overwhelmed

Actions

Minimising transmission in the community

Public information campaign for all

Tailored to individuals and communities at high risk

Comprehensive, near real-time, population-wide surveillance system

Flu vaccination, concerted effort 

Minimise coronavirus and flu transmission everywhere

Track, trace and isolate programme ready for winter

Shielding

Hospitals and care homes

COVID-19 and COVID-19-free zones

Ensure there is adequate PPE

System-wide infection control, minimise transmission in hospital and other residential care settings

Factors

High degree of uncertainty about how epidemic will evolve 

Rt 1.7 from September 2020 onwards

Peak in hospital admissions and deaths in January and February 2021

September 2020 to June 2021, 119,900 hospital-based deaths (excluding care homes)

Government would act to reduce the transmission rate

Dexamethasone (and heparin)

Need for immediate action

It must be done now

Masks mandated in shops in England from 24th July. Already mandatory in shops in Scotland.
