Fronted by Thomas Mars, Phoenix were in town to support their hit album, "Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix." The session in 2009 was actually the second time Phoenix had visited our studio; they first performed at The Current in April 2005, when the station wasn't even three months old.

2:01 "1901"
5:00 "Playground Love"
