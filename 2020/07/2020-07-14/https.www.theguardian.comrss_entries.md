<p>Important mistakes could be made if we look to the past to assess current tensions between the two countries </p><p>A “new cold war” has become almost a default description of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/20/us-china-cold-war-liberal-de">the current rivalry</a> between the United States and China. Some structural similarities do indeed exist with the post-second world war global stage, when the Soviet Union was pitted against the US.</p><p>Just as, say, in 1950, we live now in a sort of bipolar system. In terms of economic power, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/14/south-china-sea-us-says-beijings-claims-to-disputed-area-completely-unlawful">military might</a>, global influence and ability to pollute the planet, two powers – China and the US – clearly stand in a league of their own. And just as during the cold war, this bipolarism is spurious and asymmetrical: simply put, one side – the US – is way more powerful and influential than the other. The similarities end, however, with this systemic parallel. As is often the case when thinking analogically, invoking a cyclical vision of history obfuscates more than it clarifies. More importantly, such thinking produces policy prescriptions – such as promoting an aggressive “containment” of China – which, in addition to being based on a superficial and misleading reading of history, are at best useless and at worst outright dangerous.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/14/the-us-china-rivalry-is-not-a-new-cold-war-and-its-dangerous-to-call-it-that">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Plot Against America is the latest what-if series about the rise of fascism to arrive on our screens. But while some are sensitively-made, others risk glorifying disturbing beliefs</p><p>Stopping the world and getting off is what TV drama lets us do. Any fiction creates some kind of alternative reality, even if it’s just our own world with imaginary characters. But right now, the alternative history drama, where we exchange our present for a life in which humanity took a different path, is big.

Shows such as The Handmaid’s Tale, which introduces a novel event (part of the US is taken over by an extreme religious dictatorship) rather than reshaping an existing one, aren’t alternative histories, but they perform the same function of providing a what-if warning.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/14/the-plot-against-america-tv-alternative-alternate-histories-the-man-in-the-high-castle">Continue reading...</a>

## Lucian Msamati on Amadeus: 'Colour-blind casting? I want you to see my colour'

<p>The star of the National Theatre’s revival, streaming this month, talks about genius, unlocking characters and how Peter Shaffer’s play became an ‘orgy of artistic love’</p><p><strong>The director Michael Longhurst has said that he wanted to show a Salieri who was not a classical villain. How did you approach the character to give him humanity and humour?<br /></strong>I knew the film and loved it and had also seen a production in Zimbabwe many years ago. When I sat down to read the script, what pinged out to me was that Salieri is a man who absolutely loves music. It is his lifeblood. The second thing was that in my own personal experience and the experiences of others I know, there is always that individual in your life [like Mozart] who makes you sit there, punching and kicking and scratching at the walls, saying: “How did they do that? How are they creating masterpieces when I’m creating stick figures?” So I could completely identify with Salieri in being both fascinated and disgusted by it.</p><p><strong>You played Iago in <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p089zj52/culture-in-quarantine-shakespeare-othello">Othello</a> a year before this production. Was that role – of a man also eaten up by jealousy – preparation for this one?<br /></strong>The challenge in all of it is to find the weakest point in any character which, I believe, is how you tap into the humanity of that character without judgment. Tapping into jealousy in itself is very easy. It’s more difficult to tap into love for the victim of that jealousy; just as Salieri loves music, Iago loves Othello. I don’t think you can commit yourself to such a dogged path of revenge or retribution unless you feel a great love – from great love comes great hurt and hate. The hate is easier to access than the love and it’s more complicated with Iago.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/14/lucian-msamati-salieri-amadeus-mozart-national-theatre-at-home">Continue reading...</a>

## Snyder took an age to drop Washington's racist nickname. And he'll still profit

<p>Washington’s owner reacted as the street talked and the money walked. This was far from a philanthropic decision by the billionaire</p><p><br />On the eve of the 2014 season Daniel Snyder took to the airwaves to defend his claim to the racial slur that had served as the nickname for his NFL franchise pretty much since its creation. Appearing on ESPN’s Outside the Lines, the camera-shy billionaire reached for earnestness. “Whether it’s the owners or the people at the league, most people understand what the team name means,” Snyder said. “They look at it as we all do – as honor, respect.”</p><p>That was of course until Monday, when the team pronounced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/13/washington-announce-redskins-nickname-changed">the “Redskins” name and logo retired</a>. This rebranding effort, the denouement of a decades-long linguistic and legal debate, marks a stunning reversal for arguably the most mule-headed steward of any US sports franchise. Ever since Snyder bought the team at the turn of the century, he has held fast to the notion that the name actually honors Native Americans. “Dan cares more than anybody,” his wife, Tanya, told ESPN. “He’s the most passionate fan that there is.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/14/dan-snyder-washington-nfl-name-change-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘America’s weirdest state’ offers an extreme case of the country’s broader failure to take the pandemic seriously</p><p>I have spent the past three months in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/19/bad-week-for-trump-not-supporters-cheering-him-at-every-turn">my home state of Florida</a>, during which time I’ve watched it become the hottest of coronavirus hotspots on the planet. This week began with the announcement that the state registered <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/12/15000-new-coronavirus-cases-florida-record-daily-total-us">over 15,000 new infections</a> in a single day, which was almost 3,000 more daily cases than any state previously had recorded since the pandemic began. If Florida was a country, according to Reuters, it would have the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/florida-sets-one-day-record-with-over-15000-new-covid-cases-more-than-most-countries-idUSKCN24D0HE">world’s fourth-highest tally</a> of new Covid-19 cases over that 24-hour span, trailing only the US, Brazil and India.</p><p>Florida has a well-deserved reputation as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250143640/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">America’s weirdest state</a>, so perhaps the pandemic punishment being meted out to us right now shouldn’t come as a shock. A 1948 Fortune magazine study observed: “Florida is a study in abnormal psychology, useful in signaling the … hidden derangements of the national mood.” A lot of bad trends in American life find their most bizarre and refined forms in the Sunshine state, which is why “<a href="https://www.boredpanda.com/hilarious-florida-man-headings/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic">Florida Man</a>” has become shorthand for the bad behavior of too many state residents. As far as the present pandemic is concerned, the simplest and most convincing explanation for why Florida is experiencing an explosion of Covid-19 cases it that it is an extreme case of the broader American failure to take the pandemic seriously.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/florida-coronavirus-outbreak">Continue reading...</a>

How will they fare as the first professional hosts to join streaming platform Twitch?</p><p>Speaking on a video call from his makeshift home studio in Buckinghamshire, Iain Lee praises the skills of his broadcasting partner Katherine Boyle – although he is unsure whether she can hear him as her camera flickers on and off and her microphone emits an ominous crackling sound. “Katherine is one of the most talented people I’ve ever worked with. She’s also really crap at technology,” he jokes. Her face pops back into focus momentarily, before her phone falls over with a clatter and her portion of the screen goes blank once more. “Jesus!” he exclaims, before adding: “Now I can see why you were <em>just</em> a co-host.”</p><p>Lee is not sincerely slamming Boyle, but instead mocking a crushing conversation the pair say they had with a boss at TalkRadio, where they hosted The Late Night Alternative With Iain Lee for four years before it was suddenly axed at the start of June, to the dismay of its modest but devoted audience.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/14/iain-lee-and-katherine-boyle-women-are-normally-sidekicks-on-the-radio">Continue reading...</a>

Stuck in the nosebleed seats, she decided to blag her way backstage at the end of the show. “I was just telling security: ‘I’m going to be a star someday, I’m going to pay all your bills if you just let me back,’” she says via Zoom, her trademark husky voice frayed slightly by final sessions for her new album, B7. Amazingly, the charm offensive worked, but Houston had already gone. “I was crushed,” she sighs. “My mom was like: ‘You’ll meet her when you put music out.’”</p><p>That same year, 1993, Brandy signed to Atlantic Records. A year later, she released her Grammy-nominated, self-titled debut. By 1996, she was the star of the teen sitcom Moesha, and, in 1997, she was hand-picked by Houston to play the title role in a TV remake of Cinderella. “So I’m working with her side by side,” she says, eyes wide. “It’s just something that’s still surreal to this day.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/14/brandy-music-is-my-therapy-i-dont-know-what-life-would-be-without-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Michaela Coel’s I May Destroy You was a triumph, but a lifetime of seeing black characters suffer on screen made it hard to shake a feeling of dread</p><p>The first time I noticed it was when Terry was walking home from the club. In the third episode of I May Destroy You, Michaela Coel’s character, Arabella, is high on drugs, and Terry – unable to get any sense out of her – decides to go home alone. She walks down the backstreets of Ostia in Italy. It’s dark, she’s stumbling while following Google Maps on her phone. The camera follows her from behind. Two men walk around a corner and do a double take. At that moment, I realised I’d started to grip the arms of my chair.</p><p>Outside a bar, an Italian man begins to chat her up, and they end up dancing inside where another man notices her. My mind started to race. I remembered a New Yorker piece about girls from Nigeria being <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-reporters-path-to-uncovering-human-trafficking">sex trafficked to Italy</a>, and the stories black women have told me about the times men in southern Europe have approached them assuming they were prostitutes.

<p>Nestlé’s sleek, chic capsule system changed the way we drink coffee. But in an age when everyone’s a coffee snob and waste is wickedness, can it survive?</p><p>In 1975, a young engineer named Eric Favre took a trip to Rome that would change the history of coffee. Favre had recently started working at Nestlé’s headquarters in Vevey, Switzerland, and one of his first projects was to develop a machine that would combine the convenience of domestic coffee with the quality of an Italian espresso bar, where customers paid more for a product made by an expert using large, expensive equipment.</p><p>Successful products can look inevitable in hindsight, but the gap in the market wasn’t obvious. At the time, two kinds of coffee were drunk at home. There was roast and ground, which was tasty but laborious, whether prepared in a cafetière, stove-top or filter machine. Or there was soluble instant coffee, which was quick and easy but had an unsubtle flavour. To be tempting at a higher price, Favre’s new machine had to offer high-quality coffee with the speed and ease of instant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/14/nespresso-coffee-capsule-pods-branding-clooney-nestle-recycling-environment">Continue reading...</a>

The Guardian’s Tania Branigan examines whether a much-promoted ‘golden era’ between the two countries is at an end </p><p>In 2015 George Osborne, the then chancellor, promised a ‘golden decade’ for Chinese-British relations as he drummed up support for new trade opportunities and inward investment. That has all changed after China imposed a harsh new security law in Hong Kong and now the UK government is preparing to backtrack on an agreement to use the Chinese firm Huawei in its 5G infrastructure. </p><p>The Guardian’s leader writer <strong>Tania Branigan </strong>tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>that this new phase in relations is going to be difficult for the UK. Last week, Beijing’s ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, <a href="https://twitter.com/AmbLiuXiaoMing/status/1280572886319857666">warned</a>: “China wants to be UK’s friend and partner.
