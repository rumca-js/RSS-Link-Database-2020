Sony is reportedly increasing the production of PS5 units, Marvel's Avengers beta starts next month, and Assassin's Creed Valhalla is bringing back a beloved feature.

It was initially reported that the PS5's launch supply could be lower than the PS4's, but that doesn't seem to be the case. According to Nikkei Asian Review, Sony's production order has increased from 6 million to 9 million units. Marvel's Avengers beta starts next month, but there's a caveat: its release will be staggered across platforms. In the meantime, you can look forward to the next Avengers War Table stream on July 29 at 10 AM PT. It will detail what we can expect from the beta.

Finally, a beloved feature is returning to the Assassin's Creed franchise: social stealth. In Assassin's Creed Valhalla, you'll be able to put on a hood and discreetly sneak through crowds once again.

And hey, while you're here, GameSpot launched its own merch store.  Until the end of August, all the proceeds will be split between Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 relief.

The Origami King keeps its RPG systems and character work light, but revamped combat and solid gags throughout are the course-correction Paper Mario needed.

Suriel Vazquez spent about 45 hours completing the main questline, finding most of the collectibles and secrets in every area, and at one point drawing the battle grid on a paper plate to figure out some of the more devious encounters. Review code was provided by the publisher.

Ubisoft Forward may not have had many surprises, but it did have plenty of release dates. Hyper Scape is currently in open beta for PC, Watch Dogs: Legion and Assassin's Creed Valhalla are both coming later this year, and Far Cry 6 is scheduled for February 2021. 

Plenty of games make there debut on Xbox Game Pass, but Cyberpunk 2077 will not be one of them. While there is an exclusive Cyberpunk 2077-themed Xbox One, the partnership doesn't extend to Game Pass, it seems. Microsoft and Sony are taking different approaches to the next generation of consoles. Sony is going the more traditional route with PS5-only games, while Microsoft, however, wants to launch games across both Xbox One and Xbox Series X.
