So you set out to put your plan to change the rules of the game. But you quickly run into inefficient politicians and bureaucrats - the classic problem of monopolies. \n\nWe\u2019ve had the agricultural revolution, the commercial and industrial revolutions, but why not a governance revolution? Enter the sea.\n\nSeasteading or floating cities on the sea, where \u201caquatic citizens\u201d live in modular pods that can detach and join other cities at any time would be in international waters.\n\nBefore you call this impossible, we already have cities and other giant structures on the sea. They\u2019re called cruise ships. Japan\u2019s many giant floating airports,the Netherlands, hundreds of amphibious homes, container ships. Shell\u2019s floating natural gas facility that\u2019s longer than the empire state building, nuclear submarines, nuclear aircraft carriers that can stay at sea for 15 to 20 years before refueling. This is the race for the Aquatic Age.\n\nThe basic idea behind seasteads starts with the platform. The floating platform can be built out of steel, concrete, or things like carbon fiber, all of which are already used in water-related projects. Once you have the platforms, you can build anything on top of it. Cruise ships are the perfect example of ocean cities. They have more amenities than the average town. \n\nWhat\u2019s the difference between the Koreas? Simple - the rules, the laws, how they govern over their subjects. \n\nHong Kong was ruled by the British until they eventually gave it back to China. China was so impressed with the success of Hong Kong that it designated Hong Kong as a special economic zone. Today, Hong Kong has the most expensive real estate in the world and has the second most billionaires in the world behind New York.\n\nShenzhen, another SEZ in China, has risen to the hardware capital of the world\n\nSingapore doesn\u2019t have many natural resources besides their harbor. They have universal health care yet the government makes more money than it spends. They follow typical English laws yet they dish out death sentences over zoom\n\nSeasteading isn\u2019t the answer to our most complex problems. The answer is more experiments in government. \n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
