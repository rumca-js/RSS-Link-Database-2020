Just over half of these households contain more than one generation living together with at least one person aged 0 to 19 years, one person aged 20 to 69 years and one person aged 70 years or over\n\nHouseholds containing someone aged 70 years or over are more likely to contain a mix of ages living together if that person\u2019s ethnicity is Bangladeshi or Pakistani\n\nONS\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/coronaviruscovid19relateddeathsbyethnicgroupenglandandwales/2march2020to15may2020\n\n\u2022 Males of Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian ethnic background also had a significantly higher risk of death involving COVID-19 (1.5 and 1.6 times, respectively) than White males once region, population density, socio-demographic and household characteristics were accounted for; whilst for females in Bangladeshi or Pakistani, Indian, Chinese and Mixed ethnic groups the risk of death involving COVID-19 was equivalent to White females.\n\n\u2022 When looking at total number of deaths involving COVID-19 88.6% were of people from a White ethnic group, 6.2 % from an Asian ethnic group, 4.0% from a Black ethnic group and 0.5 % from an Other ethnic group\n\n\u2022 Statistician's comments\n\n\u2022 \u201cONS analysis continues to show that people from a Black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID-19 than all other ethnic groups. The risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males and nearly two and a half times higher for black females than white. Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for Black males and around one and a half times for black females. Significant differences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. The ONS will continue to research this unexplained increased risk of death, examining the impact of other health conditions.\u201d \n\u2022 Nick Stripe, Head of Life Events, Office for National Statistics", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcT2eYrIBnQ", "date_published": "2020-07-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "Update, UK, US and Global", "description": "Global numbers\n\nCases, 17, 084,446\n\nDeaths, 668,250\n\nSelf-isolation\n\nQuarantine\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk/coronavirus-covid-19-how-to-self-isolate-when-you-travel-to-the-uk\n\n14 days\n\nAfter symptoms begin\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/global-health/science-and-disease/coronavirus-news-leicester-second-wave-lockdown-cases/\n\nSelf-isolate for 10 days, up from 7 days (England's deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van-Tam) \nLow but real possibility of infectivity, 7 \u2013 10 days after onset of first symptoms\n\nUK\n\nhttps://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/articles/comparisonsofallcausemortalitybetweeneuropeancountriesandregions/januarytojune2020\n\nDeaths, 46,046\n\nONS\nComparisons of all-cause mortality between European countries and regions: January to June 2020\n\nAnalysis of Weeks 8 to 24 (week ending 21 February to week ending 12 June) \n\nEngland, highest levels of excess mortality in Europe for the period as a whole. \n\nUS\n\nCases, 4, 447, 648\n\nDeaths, 151, 077\n\nCongressman Louis Gohmert\n\nOften non-mask wearer\n\nI\u2019m asymptomatic, but apparently, I have the Wuhan virus\n\n\u2018I can\u2019t help but wonder, if by keeping a mask on, and keeping it in place if I might have put some germs, some of the virus on to the mask and breathed it in\u2019\n\nWas not wearing a mask the day before diagnosis\n\nNancy now mandating masks on the house floor\n\nFauci (Re-tweet)\n\nWhen you have a bunch of people spouting something, that isn\u2019t true, the only recourse you have is to be very very clear in presenting the scientific data that essentially contradicts that\n\nCDC, week 29, W/E 18 July\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html\n\nOverall weekly hospitalization rates increased for past three consecutive weeks\n\nAmerican Indian or Alaska Native, have an age-adjusted hospitalization rate approximately 5.3 times that of whites\n\nBlacks, x 4.7\n\nHispanics or Latinos, x 4.6\n\n21 states now red zones\n\n100 new cases per week 100,000 people\n\nIdaho\nCalifornia\nNevada\nUtah\nArizona\nNorth Dakota\nWisconsin\nIowa\nMissouri\nKansas\nOklahoma\nTexas\nArkansas\nLouisiana\nTennessee\nNorth Carolina\nSouth Carolina\nMississippi\nAlabama\nGeorgia\nFlorida\n\nFauci, also troubling signs in\nOhio\nIndiana\nKentucky\nTennessee\n\nSurge, 2 \u2013 3 weeks down the pike\n\nFlorida\n\nRecord increase in COVID-19 deaths for third day in a row\n\nCases, + 9,956 = 461,000\n\nDeaths, + 252 = 6,709\n\n \n\nUniversity of Florida (refuses to confirm)\n\nhttps://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/934771?src=wnl_edit_tpal&uac=127834AR&impID=2481959&faf=1\n\nCluster of COVID-19 infections in 17 + 2\n\nAnesthesiology department\n\nWent to a party earlier in July + 20 \u2013 30 others\n\nAll now recovering at home\n\nIt is not clear whether the residents and fellow worked while infected\n\nSuper-spreader event \n\nNeed for personal responsibility\n\n\n\nHajj\n\nhttps://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/07/coronavirus-outbreak-accelerating-brazil-live-updates-200729230051532.html\n\n2.5m last year\n\nSaudi government, 1,000 to 10,000\n\nIndia\nCases, + 52,123 = 1, 582, 028\nDeaths, + 775 = 34, 956 \n\nInfections in rural areas are continuing to rise sharply, alarming experts who fear weak healthcare systems there will be unable to cope.\n\nRussia\nCases, + 5,509 = 834,499\nDeaths, + 129 = 13,802\n\nAfghanistan\n\nCases, 36, 543\n\nDeaths, 1, 271\n\nPeople crowding into markets\n\nIgnoring distancing orders\n\nRarely wearing masks\n\nEid al-Adha in Kabul, Afghanistan\n\n\nPhilippines\nCases, 3,954 = 85,486\n\nDeaths, 1, 962\n\n\n\n\n\nSweden\n\nRenewed encouragement to work from home when possible\n\nReducing crowding on public transport\n\n\"if our contacts go up again there is a considerable risk of a new spread during the autumn\".\n\nNepal\nMount Everest and others\n\nHK Data\nhttps://data.gov.hk/en-data/dataset/hk-dh-chpsebcddr-novel-infectious-agent", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4otDdciULY", "date_published": "2020-07-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
