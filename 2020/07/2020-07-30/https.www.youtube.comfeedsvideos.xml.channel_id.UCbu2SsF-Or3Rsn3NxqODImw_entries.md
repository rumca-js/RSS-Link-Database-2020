Diplo held his final concert in his summer Fortnite residency on July 31 within Fortnite's Party Royale mode. Players got to see a short set of the musicians library of tracks as they drove ATVs into walls, flew around in gliders, and emoted towards the sky. 

Diplo's stage featured glowing panels, bounce pads, and plunger crossbows as the DJ spun records in front of fantastical neon backgrounds. It was a much quieter affair than Travis Scott's larger-than-map performance but the intimate setting was enjoyable. It also didn't have any capacity limits--anyone who wanted to join could enjoy the show.

This concert only featured Diplo but previous concerts have had appearances from the other members of Major Lazer as well as Young Thug, Noah Cyrus, Jordan Fisher, and others. 

Party Royale is Fortnite's non-violent game mode that prioritizes fun over victory royales. The main stage within the mode has also been the home of Christoper Nolan movie screenings, Star Wars trailer premieres, and a handful of other concerts. It also features paintball guns, party games, and race tracks all without the fear of getting eliminated by a sweaty player with a sniper rifle. 

A rebroadcast of the event is happening on Monday, August 3 at 9 PM ET/6 PM PT

In this video, Persia talks about a new update coming this October to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The update includes a variety of things like a new video clip sharing system, new costumes for Wolf, and two boss-related modes. Reflection of Strength allows you to fight past foes without replaying the story by visiting Sculptor's Idols, and Gauntlet of Strength is a boss rush mode that only gives you one life.

Persia also goes over this morning's Avengers War Table livestream, which showcased the upcoming beta. The beta will have four playable characters, HARM challenge rooms, and Warzone and Drop Zone missions, all of which you can play solo or with friends. HARM Challenge Rooms have increasingly difficult waves of enemies, Warzones are repeatable missions that can last from 10 minutes to 2 hours, and Drop Zones are more quick encounters. Hawkeye was officially announced as part of the game's post-launch roster, and more characters are on the way in future updates. 

On the topic of new characters, Valorant announced Killjoy after recent leaks. Killjoy's abilities vary from stealth mines, to mini turrets, to an Alarmbot that functions much like Raze's bot. Her ultimate ability creates a dome around a designated area that detains any enemies within its radius. 

Don't forget that we're approaching the final month of our Play For All donation drive. You can also visit store.gamespot.com to purchase merch. All proceeds will go towards Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 relief efforts. 

This is your Save State for Wednesday, July 29th.
