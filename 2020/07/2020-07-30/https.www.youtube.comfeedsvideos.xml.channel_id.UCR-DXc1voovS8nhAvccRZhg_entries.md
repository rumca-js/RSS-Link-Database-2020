The FINAL Raspberry Pi Cluster series episode! In this episode, I review the Turing Pi. Is it worth $189? When will it start shipping? Why would I even build a Pi Cluster in the first place?

tl;dw: It depends. It's not the best cluster you can buy, but for some use cases (especially for fun and learning!) it might be a good option!
