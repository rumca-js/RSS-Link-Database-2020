Four years ago, in July 2016, the Staves visited The Current for a live session performed for an audience in the 100-seat Forum at Minnesota Public Radio. At the time, sisters Jessica, Camilla and Emily Staveley-Taylor had been spending a lot of time in and around Eau Claire, Wis., located about 90 minutes' drive east of The Current, working at Justin Vernon's April Base studio there. "Working with Justin's great," Camilla said at the time. "For one, he's incredibly talented, so has great ideas. Almost more than that, he has a very pure love of music, and I think that's mirrored in how he works with people and how he collaborates with people. There's no ego there. It's about him being passionate about wanting you to get the most out of this experience."
We're looking back on that experience in 2016 by sharing these videos from the day.

This Friday, July 31, rock band Fontaines D.C. will release their new album, "A Hero's Death," on Partisan Records. These Irish rockers met while attending art college in Dublin (the "D.C." stands for "Dublin City"), and we first met them during SXSW 2019, where they played a searing set of bash-'em-out rock and roll tunes at our Day Party. Watch three songs from that amazing show, recorded live at the Barracuda in Austin, Texas, in March 2019.

July 30, 2020: Taylor Swift isn't an 'independent artist' in the conventional sense, but her new album 'folklore' was assembled remotely with indie artists like Aaron Dessner and Justin Vernon. From Nur-D to Charli XCX, everyone's going DIY these days. Will this become the new normal?
