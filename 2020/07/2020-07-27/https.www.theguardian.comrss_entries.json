And now that many of us are juggling home schooling and working from home, it can feel more difficult than ever to get your children to go the extra mile. But when children return to the classroom, and school work and homework are no longer the same thing, how can we keep kids motivated to continue learning at home too? It\u2019s a challenge which we need to address, because cracking the homework challenge can have big benefits for both parents and children, says Charlotte Gater, Explore Learning\u2019s head of curriculum.</p><p>\u201cAs a school governor, I appreciate that there\u2019s a big range of views about homework \u2013 whether you think your children get too much, or too little, or whether you\u2019re happy with the level the school sets,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it can help you feel engaged with what\u2019s happening in the school. You can see if your child understands what\u2019s being set. The teacher can see if the child can manage a topic by themselves, without the classroom setting.

The showcase revealed 22 games, \u201cbuilt to launch exclusively on Xbox consoles\u201d, nine coming from first-party teams \u2013 a clear response to Sony\u2019s live event in June, which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jun/16/exclusive-games-playstation-5-sony?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Telegram\">concentrated on exclusive PlayStation 5 titles</a>.
