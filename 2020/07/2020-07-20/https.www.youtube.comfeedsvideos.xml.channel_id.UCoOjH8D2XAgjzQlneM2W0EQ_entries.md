In celebration of the release of the Ghost of Tsushima

So you come across the Yakuza - Japan’s organized crime syndicates. They offer structure, a surrogate family to be a part of, and provides you with a way to climb up the ranks of society. Being a Yakuza means that the same society that looked down upon you, would now have to bow down to you in fear and submission.

Today’s Yakuza have grown to be much more sophisticated. Instead of just gangsters, the smart ones are now economic gangsters, or Keizai Yakuza. Instead of just your typical rackets like extortion, gambling, drug dealing which still very much happens - they’ve catapulted themselves into the world of high finance, legitimate businesses, the stock market, real estate investments, multinational corporations. You’re gonna have to understand the economics of the Yakuza.

The Yamaguchi-gumi is structured kinda like the American Mafia. One of the main differences between the Yakuza and other crime organizations like the Mafia is the oyabun-kobun relationship, which literally translates to “father role-child role”. The Godfather is part of the upper management that makes all the syndicate’s big. Then there’s the grunts of the syndicate that do all the dirty work and runs all the gang’s different money making operations.

The Yamaguchi-gumi was bringing in well over $460 million dollars annually, or over $1.3 billion dollars in today’s money. Yakuza are integrated into society, they’re very open about their numbers to researchers and the press - making the Yakuza, one of the most well-researched syndicates out there. And Godfathers will make around $400/yr, or around $1m/yr in today’s money.

The Yakuza also have some unwritten rules that must be followed, or else you’ll face some dire consequences: Never reveal secrets of Yakuza, No withholding money from family, Always be obedient to superiors, Don’t appeal to police or the law.

As Japan ended Feudalism with democracy and industry, these Yakuza gangs adjusted to the modernizing economy. The old Yakuza are fading out and the new generation are much more violent, care less about chivalry, honor, traditions, and only really care about money.
