Perhaps the filmmakers were attracted by the buzz around the band in spring 1970. Their eponymous debut album had been a critical and commercial flop, but a certain media momentum was now building thanks to a new line-up featuring saxophonist Steve Mackey and the songs they had written for their second album, Fun House. Rolling Stone, Creem and even Entertainment World ran big features on the band. Perhaps they were just looking for something visually arresting and had heard the stories about what happened at Stooges shows: their frontman diving into the crowd, or swinging from the ceiling, or pouring hot wax over his chest.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/iconic-festival-sets-the-stooges-cincinnati-pop-1970-iggy-pop\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/iconic-festival-sets-the-stooges-cincinnati-pop-1970-iggy-pop", "date_published": "2020-07-20 13:00:07+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Trump's sweaty Fox News interview shows his 2020 chances melting away | Richard Wolffe", "description": "<p>With every new poll showing him losing, both nationally and in battleground states, Trump\u2019s despair dribbled through all of his pores Sunday<br /></p><p>Two generations ago, Richard Nixon sweated his way to losing the <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2021078,00.html\">first</a> ever presidential debate on television to a young, fit and cool John F Kennedy.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jul/20/coronavirus-donald-trump-fox-interview-mike-pompeo-joe-biden-live-updates\">US politics: coronavirus cases top 3.75m as scientists appeal for Trump to listen \u2013 live updates</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/jul/20/trump-interview-fox-news-election-polls-chances-melting-away\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2020/jul/20/trump-interview-fox-news-election-polls-chances-melting-away", "date_published": "2020-07-20 12:59:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Republican leaders to meet Trump as talks begin on new Covid-19 relief bill", "description": "<ul><li>Democrats scheduled to meet separately to discuss package</li><li>President seeking to block billions in track-and-trace funds</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jul/20/coronavirus-donald-trump-fox-interview-mike-pompeo-joe-biden-live-updates\">US politics \u2013 live coverage</a></li></ul><p>Republican leaders were scheduled to meet Donald Trump at the White House on Monday as Congress began negotiations on a new coronavirus relief package.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/20/national-academy-sciences-donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">US scientists rebuke Trump over coronavirus response and other affronts</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/20/coronavirus-aid-package-talks-republicans-trump-to-meet-relief-bill\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/20/coronavirus-aid-package-talks-republicans-trump-to-meet-relief-bill", "date_published": "2020-07-20 12:54:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dance music star the Black Madonna changes name due to racial insensitivity", "description": "<p>Marea Stamper, now the Blessed Madonna, said her original name reflected her devotion to dark-hued Catholic icons, but acknowledged the \u2018pain and frustration\u2019 it had caused</p><p>The successful American DJ and producer the Black Madonna has changed her name to the Blessed Madonna, following a petition for her to change it on grounds of racial insensitivity and cultural appropriation.</p><p>The Blessed Madonna \u2013 real name Marea Stamper \u2013 announced the change in a post on Twitter.
