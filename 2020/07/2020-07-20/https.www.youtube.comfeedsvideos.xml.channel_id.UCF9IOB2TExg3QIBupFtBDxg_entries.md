Well, probably. Synairgen's SNG001, Interferon beta

£21.29 per injection

http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/synairgens_sng001_shows_strong_promise_in_covid-19_trial_1345119

Interferon beta

Naturally occurring antiviral protein

Cytokine

Interfere with viral replication

Induce fever and muscle pains (along with other cytokines)

Activate immune cells, natural killer cells and macrophages

Reduces protein synthesis in adjacent cells

Activates an enzyme to destroy RNA, further reducing protein synthesis

Stimulates many other interferon-stimulated genes

Stimulates infected cells into apoptosis

Key component of human immune defence against viral infection

Phase 2 study

Inhaled interferon beta

Gives high local concentrations

Placebo controlled

n = 101 hospitalised patients 

All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2

9 UK hospitals

Diabetics
Treatment group = 9 
Placebo group = 3

Cardiovascular disease
Treatment group = 5
Placebo group = 8

Now recruiting patients ill with COVID-19 in the community

Results

79% reduction in risk of developing severe disease

Requiring ventilation or resulting in death

During the treatment period

Day one to day 16

This difference was also noted to day 28

Patients who received SNG001 were more than twice as likely to recover

Defined as ‘no limitation of activities’ or ‘no clinical or virological evidence of infection’

Measure of breathlessness, markedly reduced

In patients with more severe disease at time of admission

SNG001 increased the likelihood of hospital discharge during the study

Six days versus nine days for those receiving placebo (not significant difference)

More than twice as likely to have recovered by the end of the treatment period (strong 
trend)

Safety

6% died after being randomised to placebo

No deaths in the SNG001 group

Professor Tom Wilkinson

Professor of Respiratory Medicine, University of Southampton

Trial chief investigator

Huge potential

To be able to restore the lung’s immune response

Enhancing protection

Accelerating recovery

Countering the impact of SARS-CoV-2 virus

Professor Stephen Holgate

Medical Research Council

Clinical Professor of Immunopharmacology at the University of Southampton

Restores the lung’s ability to neutralise the virus

or any mutation of the virus

or co-infection with another respiratory virus such as influenza

Relationship with dexamethasone and remdesivir

Study did not include patients requiring ventilatory support

## Coronavirus, Long term immunity more likely

SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z_reference.pdf

Memory T cells induced by infection

Future susceptibility and clinical severity

Patients recovered from in COVID-19

T cells from recovered patients recognised multiple regions of the SARS-CoV-2

Patients recovered from SARS (SRS-CoV-1)

SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS

17 years after the 2003 outbreak

Robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP, (structural nucleocapsid protein) 

Surprisingly

Frequently detected SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, 

COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=37)

In these people the T cells were active against a different part of the virus

Epitope low homology to “common cold” human coronaviruses

Infection with betacoronaviruses induces multispecific and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP

Cows, dogs, bats, rodents

Understanding pre-existing T cell immunity in the general population is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic
