It seems like birds would want to hide their eggs, but there are hundreds of species that lay blue to blue-green eggs. Thanks to some clever experiments, we’re finally starting to understand why birds might benefit from conspicuously colored eggs.

Hidden beneath Greenland’s ice and powered by a nuclear reactor, Camp Century made for an interesting US military base.
