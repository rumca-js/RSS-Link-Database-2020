<p>A camera crew from a local TV station decided to film Iggy Pop’s band even though they were far from top of the bill ... and the footage was extraordinary</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/series/20-iconic-festival-sets">Read all of the pieces in the 20 iconic festival sets series</a></li></ul><p>Cincinnati’s Midsummer Rock festival would probably be as forgotten as one of the dozens of post-Woodstock events that sprang up across America in the summer of 1970 – Sky River, the Cosmic Carnival, the Day of Joy, Kickapoo Creek, Rainy Daze – had a camera crew from a local TV station not been on hand to film it. It was subsequently broadcast as a 90-minute TV special, Midsummer Rock, and there’s every chance their footage would have been forgotten too – consigned to the same dusty corner of rock history as the films shot at that summer’s Atlanta Pop or Love Valley festivals – had they not elected to shoot at least some of the day’s performance by the Stooges.</p><p>That they did was a curious decision. The Stooges were far from top of the bill – the festival’s big draws were the reformed Traffic, or, if you preferred your music “heavy”, Mountain and Grand Funk Railroad, both riding high on the back of gold-selling debut albums. Perhaps the filmmakers were attracted by the buzz around the band in spring 1970. Their eponymous debut album had been a critical and commercial flop, but a certain media momentum was now building thanks to a new line-up featuring saxophonist Steve Mackey and the songs they had written for their second album, Fun House. Rolling Stone, Creem and even Entertainment World ran big features on the band. Perhaps they were just looking for something visually arresting and had heard the stories about what happened at Stooges shows: their frontman diving into the crowd, or swinging from the ceiling, or pouring hot wax over his chest.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/iconic-festival-sets-the-stooges-cincinnati-pop-1970-iggy-pop">Continue reading...</a>

Founder of the London listings magazine Time Out who replicated the formula in New York and other cities around the world<p>Plenty of young people had wild ideas in the summer of 1968, but Tony Elliott – who has died aged 73 after a long illness – had a great one. It was simple and not entirely original, but it was instantly different from the profusion of underground and alternative publications bursting out of basements and bedrooms in those years.</p><p>In his mother’s London flat that August, Elliott began compiling a folded news sheet for young Londoners – in a world decades away from the internet – about what was on and where to go in a city blossoming with new cultural and political ideas that the mainstream press was mostly deaf to. A 1959 Dave Brubeck jazz album gave Elliott his title – Time Out – and thus did the first A5-sized edition appear, covering 12 August to 2 September 1968. By late September, the magazine had grown to a stapled booklet published fortnightly. From the early 1970s it was essential reading about anything from fringe theatre to the Troops Out movement, squatters’ rights, or where to buy a waterbed. Three decades later, it would be a global publishing phenomenon from Berlin to Barcelona, São Paulo to Seoul.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jul/20/tony-elliott-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His illness aside, Boris Johnson’s leadership style has served the country badly during its worst crisis in decades<br /></p><p>Britain’s prime minister is looking ever more like an Old Etonian Donald Trump. A premiership that began with sacked ministers, party purges and vacuous slogans has continued in the same vein. <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/past-six-days/2020-04-19/news/coronavirus-38-days-when-britain-sleepwalked-into-disaster-hq3b9tlgh">Revelations in the Sunday Times</a> of No 10 during Johnson’s illness are alarming. With a prime minister locked in his bedroom, his absentee aide Dominic Cummings manoeuvred the ousting of the head of the civil service, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/29/mark-sedwill-v-dominic-cummings-whitehall-call-to-arms-civil-servants-attack">Sir Mark Sedwill</a>, leaving the office in the care of a press secretary, Lee Cain. The war on Covid-19 was delegated to the health secretary, Matt Hancock, a paralysed NHS and scientists publicly feuding over dud data.</p><p>Since Johnson’s return the signs have not been good. He unwisely insists on taking press conferences at which he stutters and just repeats Cummings’ slogans, such as stay alert, save lives, build, build, build. Last Thursday, the contrast was stark between Johnson’s mumbling about “keeping safe” and the clear, crisp responses of his chancellor, Rishi Sunak. The partnership with “the science” has also collapsed. The government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jul/17/work-from-home-uk-chief-scientific-adviser-warns-of-coronavirus-risks-video">openly distanced himself</a> from Johnson’s plea for the nation to return to work, asserting he could see “absolutely no reason” for it.

## ‘Racism is killing our children’: Gee Walker on the murder of her beloved son Anthony

<p>In 2005, Anthony Walker was killed in a horrific attack, aged just 18. His mother talks about grief, forgiveness and how his death changed her, ahead of a powerful new drama about his life<br /></p><p>Fifteen years after 18-year-old Anthony Walker was murdered in a horrifyingly violent<strong> </strong>racist attack, his mother is still dealing with the fallout. On every anniversary, every birthday, Gee Walker says, she feels the pain afresh. She stops herself. She knows she is playing it down. No, she says, every <em>day</em> she feels the pain afresh. “The ifs and buts, the should haves/would haves/could-have-dones … they are always there. They never go. You can’t help thinking what if I’d done something right? What if I’d done this on the night? What if I’d stayed home and not asked him to babysit? What if I’d given him a lift? What if I’d got home a few minutes earlier?”</p><p>At about 11pm on 29 July 2005, Walker returned home from singing in the church choir. Anthony, the fourth of six children, had been babysitting his nephew, along with his girlfriend, Louise, and cousin Marcus. The two boys walked Louise to the bus stop. As the trio – the two black boys accompanying the white girl – passed the door of the Huyton Park pub, a 17-year-old called Michael Barton hurled racist abuse at the group. Huyton was known as a tough, almost exclusively white town in the borough of Knowsley, Merseyside. Anxious to prevent a confrontation, Anthony replied: “We’re only waiting for the bus and then we’re going.” When Barton said: “Walk, nigger, walk,” the group walked off to another bus stop. Barton then told his 20-year-old cousin Paul Taylor that he had “lost face”, and the two pursued them in a Peugeot car.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/20/racism-is-killing-our-children-gee-walker-on-the-of-her-beloved-son-anthony">Continue reading...</a>

Also speaking were bike couriers, whose work has taken on new significance and toll in the concentrated days of lockdown; teachers, whose lives are made even more difficult by the precariousness of short-term contracts and substitutions; airport and airline workers; carers; refugees and migrants; young architects expected to work for pitiful sums and “experience”; mothers in a Catch-22 of work and childcare; musicians and theatre workers; the homeless, and many others. It was a gathering of those whom the trade unionist and activist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b2qx7utFlo&amp;feature=youtu.be">Aboubakar Soumahoro</a> describes as<em> gli invisibili – </em>the invisible ones.

It was the sixth he had taken this season, and the sixth he had converted.</p><p>A penalty he chose not to take, however, continues to linger in the memory. Inter were already a goal and a man up at home to Bologna on 5 July when they won a spot-kick in the 61st minute. Lukaku handed the ball to Lautaro Martínez, kissing his strike partner on the head in encouragement. The Argentinian’s weak shot was saved, and Inter collapsed to a 2-1 defeat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jul/20/inter-left-to-lament-what-might-have-been-in-serie-a-as-doubts-resurface">Continue reading...</a>

I’m always a bit anxious in large groups,” says Kate.</p><p>They set off in August and quickly built a friendship. As they travelled through Europe, the pair spent plenty of time together, but neither anticipated romance. “I remember thinking he was really shy,” says Kate. “And I actually thought he fancied someone else on the trip.” Scott had recently gone through a breakup, while Kate was in a long-distance relationship with someone back home that “wasn’t really working out”. She admits that she noticed Scott’s adventurous spirit and was “impressed” when he fearlessly tackled a bungee jump in Nepal. “Everyone else in the group was really scared and he just leapt off.

<p>Finance expert says borrowers are being pushed into making needless repayments</p><p>The Student Loans Company is giving graduates a “demoralising, damaging and dangerous” picture of their debts, according to the consumer finance champion Martin Lewis, who accused the company of pushing its users into making needless repayments.</p><p>Lewis, the founder of Moneysavingexpert.com, said a new version of the SLC’s repayments website exaggerated the status of outstanding loans of former students, and prioritised quick repayment options while failing to make clear that they make “diddly squat” difference to what most people need to repay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jul/20/martin-lewis-accuses-student-loan-company-of-misleading-graduates">Continue reading...</a>

## 'I grew a beard to try to hide in public': Haley Joel Osment on success after child stardom

<p>His role as a cherubic 10-year-old with a classic catchphrase made him world famous. He talks about how he coped with the early attention, working with Kevin Spacey, and why he loves playing bad guys</p><p>Haley Joel Osment thought he was finished for the day. It was 1998 and the 10-year-old was shooting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/06/the-sixth-sense-at-20-m-night-shyamalan-bruce-willis">The Sixth Sense</a>, directed by M Night Shyamalan. With 10 minutes left on set, they wanted to squeeze in a short scene. It required Osment’s terrified character, who, memorably, sees dead people, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUbiwYHLHSM">to confront a bloody ghost</a>. Osment had to get into the right mindset, fast. The young actor threw himself against a door, again and again, until he was sufficiently shaken. “If they’d known I was going to do it, they probably would have stopped me,” he says of Shyamalan and the other adults on set. “It came to me spontaneously – and I guess it worked.”</p><p>I see little of that intensity in the 32-year-old man facing me via Zoom. Still boyish-looking, despite a dark beard, Osment is upbeat and quick to laugh. He returned to his home town of Los Angeles last autumn, after 13 years in New York, and found this house a week before lockdown, when he was shooting a forthcoming series of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/14/goliath-review-billy-bob-thornton-legal-drama-amazon">Goliath</a> for Amazon. After the extraordinary success of The Sixth Sense – a box office phenomenon, his performance lauded by critics and rewarded with an Oscar nomination, while his character’s most famous line quickly became a catchphrase – he has enjoyed a different kind of career lately.<strong> </strong>He works steadily, on screen but somehow under the radar, probably not recognised as the Sixth Sense kid by most of his audiences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/20/haley-joel-osment-on-the-sixth-sense-a-lot-of-child-actors-have-a-positive-experience">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rapper’s rambling and emotional address – which included an apparent $1m for new mothers – was almost drowned out by a rowdy crowd in Charleston </p><p>Kanye West has launched his campaign tour for the US presidential election in chaotic fashion at an event in Charleston, South Carolina, delivering a rambling address that touched on theology, homelessness, corporate power, and involved a long debate with an audience member about abortion. West also suggested that women should be given $1m when they have a baby.</p><p>The rapper took to the stage at the event wearing a bulletproof vest, and “2020” shaved into his head. Without a mic, he proceeded to address a rowdy audience of a few hundred people, asking for complete silence before asserting that future events “will be in rooms where the acoustics will be incredible because I will be involved with the design”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/kanye-west-launches-presidential-campaign-tour-with-chaotic-rally">Continue reading...</a>
