On Friday, July 3, Willie Nelson is set to release his next album, "First Rose of Spring." We've never had Willie in our studio, but we've certainly been lucky enough to welcome a friendly chip off the old block, Lukas Nelson. Lukas performed a session hosted by Radio Heartland's Mike Pengra, and Lukas was also welcomed to our stage by host Jade while we were in Austin, Texas, for SXSW in 2018. Enjoy these three performances by Lukas Nelson.

SONGS PERFORMED
00:00 "Forget About Georgia"
06:10 "Just Outside of Austin"
09:34 "Find Yourself" (live at SXSW 2018)
