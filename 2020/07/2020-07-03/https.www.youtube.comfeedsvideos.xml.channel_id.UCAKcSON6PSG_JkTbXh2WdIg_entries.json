Lukas performed a session hosted by Radio Heartland's Mike Pengra, and Lukas was also welcomed to our stage by host Jade while we were in Austin, Texas, for SXSW in 2018. Enjoy these three performances by Lukas Nelson.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Forget About Georgia\"\n06:10 \"Just Outside of Austin\"\n09:34 \"Find Yourself\" (live at SXSW 2018)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Emmet Kowler, Nate Ryan, Erik Stromstad\nAudio: Michael DeMark, Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/11/07/lukas-nelson-performs-in-the-radio-heartland-studio\n2018 session during SXSW in Austin, Texas: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/03/15/lukas-nelson-performing-at-pledgehouse-during-sxsw\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mLBe2aS6bM", "date_published": "2020-07-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
