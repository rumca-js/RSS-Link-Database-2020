<p>If Serpentine goes hard enough to make this a true test, Russian Emperor is fancied to make his powerful finish count at Epsom</p><p>A strong pace looks likely in Saturday’s Derby, since that would seem essential for the chances of Ballydoyle’s two main contenders, Mogul and Russian Emperor. It would also test the stamina of Kameko, the Guineas winner, who has a handy draw and will be very dangerous if they dawdle through the early stages.<br /><br />On the assumption that Serpentine, a staying type, goes hard enough from the front to make this a true test, <strong>Russian Emperor (4.55)</strong> is fancied to make his powerful finish count. The step up to this distance looks perfect for him and it also helps that there should still be some cushion in the ground after this week’s rain, because he is not the type to race handily and will probably have a dozen or more still in front of him at the home turn.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/03/frankie-dettori-derby-day">The People's Race makes way for Frankie Dettori dominating Derby day | Greg Wood</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jul/04/talking-horses-russian-emperor-to-outstay-the-favourite-for-derby-glory-horse-racing-tips">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Liverpool’s captain talks pressing, politics, what makes Jürgen Klopp angry and the mentality that breeds success</p><p>“Through tough times, you can forget how much you love the game,” Jordan Henderson says. “You can take it for granted a little bit. When you’re a small kid, you don’t really think about trophies and winning things. You’re just thinking about playing football. But as you get older, your dreams get bigger. When you get to 16, 17, 18, it comes down to winning at all costs. Doing anything you can.”</p><p>We’re talking about trophies, and fulfilment, and happiness. When does pure enjoyment, the thrill of the game, give way to something larger? Why do footballers fixate so much on silverware, measure their lives in medals? At what point does it stop being about the taking part, and become about the winning?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/03/jordan-henderson-liverpool-interview-pressing-politics-klopp-mentality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson’s measures aim to distract from his failures during the pandemic. Most British people are right to be uncomfortable</p><p>There are some glumly predictable tropes and cliches that Britain – and more particularly England – does not need to be bombarded with this weekend. These include: independence day; <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/six-small-things-looking-forward-super-saturday/" title="">super Saturday</a>; time to party; summertime booze; beers the good news; and, most of all, cheers, Boris. Stuff like this is simply propaganda. It is massively at odds with the rightly cautious mood – and the public interest – of the majority of British people.</p><p>The reopening of England’s pubs, restaurants, hotels, playgrounds and tourist attractions, and the reduction of the 2-metre distancing rule, presents a moment of great risk in the fight against Covid-19. Given the consistently <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/06/complacent-uk-draws-global-criticism-for-covid-19-response-boris-johnson" title="">poor record</a> of Boris Johnson’s government during the pandemic it is unlikely to be a properly calculated one. The driving force behind this weekend’s reopening is not that the pandemic is over. On the contrary. Leicester is a grim local reminder of that. The global picture is getting worse too. Last week, coronavirus cases <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/28/coronavirus-live-news-global-deaths-near-500000-as-australian-state-of-victoria-steps-up-efforts-to-fight-outbreak" title="">passed</a> the 10 million mark.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/03/the-guardian-view-on-reopened-pubs-a-reckless-risk-to-a-cautious-nation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Half-empty museums, galleries and cinemas sound luxurious, but there will be consequences</p><p>Space is a commodity. Cinema, as a cheap-to-enjoy, democratising artform, depends on crowds of people enjoying the same experience. Restaurants work by fitting the maximum number of covers compatible with a pleasant customer experience into their premises. Blockbuster exhibitions generate valuable income for galleries when they attract proper, elbows-out crowds. University lectures offer a convenient way of teaching a large number of students in a single space at once.</p><p>Sometimes this makes for a less than pleasant experience. Not everyone wants to be so close to their neighbours in a cafe that they can hear every nuance of their conversation; seeing art can be marred when it becomes a choreographic game, requiring neck-stretching, ducking and side-stepping. Many readers pine for absolute unpeopled silence in a library, and the close-quarters crunch of popcorn or shine of a phone screen in the cinema is a universal irritant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/03/the-guardian-view-on-socially-distanced-culture-who-pays">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For the first time since it was run, the People’s Race will be run without the people, but with the Italian showman centre stage</p><p>In the first half of the 19th century, before Epsom joined the developing rail network, tens of thousands of Londoners left home before dawn on the first Wednesday in June, walked 20 miles into Surrey to watch the Derby, and then walked – or crawled – the 20 miles home. Until the late 1800s, <a href="https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1868/may/26/the-derby-day-adjournment">parliament would rise</a> on the first Wednesday in June to allow the honourable members to join the throng. Derby Day has been inspiring <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/frith-the-derby-day-n00615">paintings</a>, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044538/">films</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/derby-day-by-dj-taylor-2301662.html">novels</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epsom_Downs_(play)">plays</a> for more than 200 years, and the vast, sprawling mass of humanity mingling on Epsom Downs has always had a central role in the story.</p><p>But not this year. For the first time since it was founded in 1780, the People’s Race will be run without The People. In earlier times of crisis, the Derby has occasionally <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7x2THT96Tg">moved from its traditional home</a>, or the familiar date in early June. In 1917, it switched to Newmarket in late July. But never before has the Derby’s public not merely been discouraged from attending but banned from Epsom outright. Ten years short of the Classic’s 250th birthday, this will be a Derby Day like no other.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/03/frankie-dettori-derby-day">Continue reading...</a>

## Tulips, peonies, lockdown … how flower power has kept my friendships blossoming

<p>Separated from her friends by the Covid-19 divide, one writer found a beautiful way to stay in touch<br /></p><p>A person must have the hardest of hearts, or the worst of hay fever, not to like flowers. We give them when we’re falling in love or when we know someone needs brightness. Flowers are the beginning of life and respect for the dead. Who isn’t happy spotting the first snowdrops of the year, or answering the door to someone smiling, the rustle of florist’s paper giving away the surprise behind their back? Giving and receiving flowers is such a simple pleasure and right now we desperately need more of it in our lives.</p><p>This spring, as the buds began to open, the world began to shut down. Flowers took on greater importance for me. Like many of us, I have no garden and my windows look over a city street. Taking my lockdown-approved daily exercise on quick evening walks when work was done, I started getting soppy about cherry blossom, spotlit by streetlights and dripping on to cars that hadn’t moved in weeks. Weekend walks took even longer as I kept stopping to look at the frothing cow parsley. It was the first spring in years I hadn’t bought cheap daffodils from the market and shoved them into an equally cheap blue glass jug. In the grey coronavirus quiet, I wanted colour and growth; life made out of soil and sunshine.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/hit-refresh/2020/jul/03/tulips-peonies-lockdown-how-flower-power-has-kept-my-friendships-blossoming">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A love of literature helped one woman switch off when an addiction to rolling news threatened to drag her down<br /></p><p>Once upon a time, in a distant land, by the sea, there lived a girl who loved a shining rectangle. The girl was foolish, and she believed the rectangle to be wise. Before the sun had fully risen, the girl would consult the rectangle, her hair tangled on her pillow, her eyes gummed together with sleep, and her husband snoring softly beside her. “Oh, rectangle, tell me,” she would whisper. “What should I be sad about today? And what should I be angry about? Magic rectangle, please bring me all of the bad news in the world, so that I might spend the day twitching, and filled with foreboding!”</p><p>The girl was me. In the days leading up to 23 March, the day of lockdown, there was much to be sad and angry about. I’d started the year with a growing, queasy awareness that my addiction to rolling news was becoming a problem, and I wanted to do something about it. My mental health was suffering, but I couldn’t blame the internet. It was my fault for filling my head with grumpiness and terror every day before breakfast. Instead of grunting over a long list of why everything was absolutely terrible, perhaps I could start the morning by reading a book?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/hit-refresh/2020/jul/03/ive-read-35-books-in-lockdown-and-its-done-wonders-for-my-mental-health">Continue reading...</a>

<p>One writer’s generosity had an unexpected benefit – she felt more resilient because she was doing what she could</p><p>When lockdown came into force I started walking – just for an hour, three or four miles at a time, to nowhere in particular. Like everyone, I was bewildered by the events of the pandemic and almost wholly convinced that it would all kind of blow over in a week or two. But then a week passed, and then two. In my flat in south London, my housemate and I watched the news each night with a growing sense of powerlessness.</p><p>The death toll was reported, the figures dissected, then re-reported and re-dissected. And alongside these were stories of myriad personal tragedies – of frontline workers who’d lost their lives, of families who’d lost their livelihoods and of the pain of isolation for those who had already been pretty isolated before the pandemic. On the one hand, I felt embarrassed that I was doing nothing, but on the other, so overwhelmed that it was hard to work out what, exactly, I should do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/hit-refresh/2020/jul/03/i-stopped-feeling-powerless-how-donating-to-charities-online-helped-my-pandemic-blues">Continue reading...</a>

## Lockdown life has been stagnant. Now I crave cafes, pubs and the human touch. Now I crave meaningless overstimulation | Eli Goldstone

<p>I’ve been sensible, productive and good for months. Now give me egg and chips and meaningless overstimulation</p><p>Throughout lockdown I’ve played a game with myself where I imagine how I might spend the first days of freedom. And yet now they’ve arrived, I probably won’t be doing any of the things that I’ve fantasised about. I can’t imagine enjoying myself while having to engage in the weird mutual delusion that everything is fine – it seems obviously foolhardy to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/03/boris-johnson-stands-by-decision-to-reopen-pubs-on-a-saturday">pick an arbitrary date</a> and declare all bets are off, while hundreds a day continue to die from the virus. I’ve seen photos of people in the US sitting on patios under plastic sheets to eat brunch, and I’m afraid I think those people are not sane.</p><p>But life has felt like a slightly stagnant, repetitive version of itself during lockdown, and I sympathise with wanting to leave the house just for the sake of it. I miss eating out, and I can’t wait to do it again. I want to go to a familiar place and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/03/the-reopening-of-restaurants-feels-like-chaos-but-at-least-there-is-a-bar-grace-dent">sit for a long time at the bar</a>, ordering a succession of plates – bitter greens in vinegar, meats made tender in their own fat – eating a little bit of something and saying, “Oh my God,” when it tastes good.

To <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/02/england-is-not-out-of-the-woods-yet-johnson-to-warn-weekend-pubgoers">pubs</a>, staring at my own reflection in the pool of gravy collected at the bottom of a Yorkshire pudding, like a hungover Narcissus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/03/lockdown-life-crave-cafes-pubs-coronavirus-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I am unable to button up trousers, open boxes, or turn the key to our front door </p><p>This week I broke my wrist and dislocated my thumb while filming a bike race segment for a show I’m working on. It’s too embarrassing to go into details, but let’s just say that the disparity between potential danger and subsequent injury has never been wider. Nobody on the shoot foresaw any possible way anyone could hurt themselves, and so I was faced with the humiliating implication that my lack of coordination was something not even a detailed risk assessment could account for.</p><p>It’s difficult to know how you will react to injury until it happens, and I can report that it turns out I overreact massively. I saw my thumb looking as if it wanted to emigrate from my hand, and I had to be given gas and air. My wife didn’t even have that when she gave birth to each of our three boys.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/03/embarrassing-accident-holding-up-broken-hands-sad-t-rex-romesh-ranganathan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘This Fourth of July is <em>yours</em>, not <em>mine</em>. <em>You</em> may rejoice, I must mourn,’ Frederick Douglass lamented 13 years before Reconstruction. Since the 19th century, abolitionists, suffragists and civil rights activists have seized the Fourth of July as an occasion to protest injustices sustained by those omitted from the founding fathers’ vision. In the 20th century, the civil rights movement and Vietnam war brought to light legacies of slavery, imperialism and sexism that continue to challenge the narrative of ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness’. Today, the potency of Black Lives Matter has established civil disobedience as an unwavering American tradition</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/gallery/2020/jul/03/july-4th-protests-history-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

<p>By 2045, a majority of the population will be people of color, which will enable them to have a transformative political impact</p><p>The collective white part of the American electorate has always had priority over others and, at some points in history, even codified the denial of others’ political participation into law. Think Jim Crow. Think voter suppression. Generations have fought and died to push us toward a more equitable future where traditionally marginalized voices can be heard, but it’s only now in modern history that their electoral power has been able to be wielded in truly substantial and significant numbers.</p><p>With that in mind, in the 2020 Democratic primary, the topic of reparations became a central part of the conversation. Reparations are, essentially, compensation for the living descendants of enslaved Americans. My ancestors – who built this country and who have never been systematically compensated by the government, which gained its wealth and power by exploiting our labor – may now finally have the numbers to make reparations happen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/03/why-republicans-are-desperate-to-keep-the-white-status-quo-as-it-disintegrates">Continue reading...</a>

Ferrell’s fame, Americanness and straightness mean that the film, in aiming for a mainstream comedy audience, misses the boat on campness. Of course, heterosexuality isn’t always an impediment to understanding the Eurovision song contest; indeed, one recent winner, Sweden’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sGOwFVUU0I">Måns Zelmerlöw</a>, is famously straight.

Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies.

Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre.

<p>This month, How to Eat is tackling the pasta salad. Is mayonnaise ever an acceptable dressing? Should you ever opt for shop-bought? And is eating it ‘al desko’ a big part of the problem?</p><p>What is it about pasta salad that people find so triggering? “Nothing on this earth will ever lead me to make a pasta salad,” wrote Nigel Slater in 2006, describing the concept as “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/jun/11/foodanddrink.shopping">disgusting</a>”. Almost 15 years later, its ability to summon the unbending militant in otherwise reasonable, mild-mannered food writers is undimmed. In May, Diana Henry tweeted: “Two words I do not want to hear together: <a href="https://twitter.com/DianaHenryFood/status/1266750597098876928">PASTA SALAD</a>.”</p><p>Had Henry been more exact, and specified creamy pasta salad, How to Eat could have given that a like. Possibly created by the<a href="https://www.tastecooking.com/who-invented-macaroni-salad/"> fusion </a>of Germanic potato salads and Italian pasta, mayo-drenched <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta_salad">pasta salads</a> are, <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/2015/06/how-to-make-the-best-pasta-salad.html">as Daniel Gritzer once put it</a>: “One of the worst things to ever come out of the American kitchen.” And, to be fair, that is not a short list.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/03/how-to-eat-pasta-salad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘A phenomenal follow-up’ or ‘a boring slog’? Guardian readers have their say about the hit video games sequel</p><p><strong>Warning: spoilers ahead</strong></p><p>Beyond being one of the most visually and technically stunning games, the story forces the player to face the consequences of choices made in the first game and refuses to shy away from the pain of those choices. The main character and the player come to the realisation that a cycle of perpetual violence is the result of vengeance and only forgiveness can help us heal. While focusing on issues like transgender rights and homophobia, PTSD, loyalty, and survival, the game also gives representation to a multitude of different women, with varying personalities, motives, and dimensions. A phenomenal follow-up to its iconic original. <strong>Erin McDonagh, 26, student and retail associate, Toronto</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jul/03/the-pinnacle-of-storytelling-reader-reviews-of-the-last-of-us-part-ii">Continue reading...</a>

I’m telling him about how the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jan/30/john-martyn-obituary">guitarist and songwriter John Martyn</a> ended his days in the small town near where I live in rural Kilkenny; he’s filling me in on how Jimi Hendrix’s bass player, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/may/13/artsfeatures">Noel Redding</a>, lived out his life in Clonakilty, the seaside town in County Cork where Mitchell lives with his wife Keiko and their two children. Redding, he says, continues to dominate conversation: “In people’s memories and anecdotes, he’s still walking the streets now.”</p><p>But neither of us was there for the heyday we’re remembering, and which provides the setting for Mitchell’s eighth novel, <em>Utopia Avenue</em>, its title the name of his invented four-piece band. In the late 1960s, both of us were just being born.

<p>Guardian reporter Aamna Modhin meets residents from Church End, a small, deprived neighbourhood in Brent, north London. She examines how housing pressures, in-work poverty and racial inequalities contributed to the deaths of 36 residents from Covid-19</p><p>The Guardian journalist<strong> Aamna Modhin</strong> tells<strong> Rachel Humphreys</strong> about reporting from Church End, a small neighbourhood in Brent, north London, which has a large Somali population. In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby. </p><p>Aamna met <strong>Rhoda Ibrahim</strong>, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, <strong>Muhammed Butt</strong>, believes the government’s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/jul/03/how-one-neighbourhood-brent-london-lost-36-residents-to-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>
