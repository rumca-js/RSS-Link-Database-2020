The step up to this distance looks perfect for him and it also helps that there should still be some cushion in the ground after this week\u2019s rain, because he is not the type to race handily and will probably have a dozen or more still in front of him at the home turn.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/03/frankie-dettori-derby-day\">The People's Race makes way for Frankie Dettori dominating Derby day | Greg Wood</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jul/04/talking-horses-russian-emperor-to-outstay-the-favourite-for-derby-glory-horse-racing-tips\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jul/04/talking-horses-russian-emperor-to-outstay-the-favourite-for-derby-glory-horse-racing-tips", "date_published": "2020-07-03 23:01:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK manufacturers to export surplus medical ventilators", "description": "<p>UK government initially called for 30,000 machines but NHS capacity was never stretched</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>UK manufacturers are to export surplus medical ventilators after they produced 14,000 to treat coronavirus patients only to find that most were not needed.</p><p>Boris Johnson hailed the success of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/04/the-inside-story-of-the-uks-nhs-coronavirus-ventilator-challenge\">\u201cventilator challenge\u201d</a>, which began in mid-March when he urged British industry to help produce up to 30,000 of the devices amid fears that NHS supplies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/03/nhs-faces-shortfall-of-ventilators-as-manufacturers-struggle-coronavirus\">could be overwhelmed</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/04/uk-manufacturers-to-export-surplus-medical-ventilators\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/04/uk-manufacturers-to-export-surplus-medical-ventilators", "date_published": "2020-07-03 23:01:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Josh Pyke, the Veronicas, Lime Cordiale and more: Australian music for isolated times", "description": "<p>Each week we add 15 (or so) new songs to a Spotify playlist to soundtrack your physical distancing amid coronavirus \u2013 and help artists you love get paid</p><p><br />As some states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/11/coronavirus-australia-lockdown-covid-19-restrictions-update-how-far-can-travel-social-distancing-rules-nsw-victoria-queensland-qld-wa-sa-act-how-many-people-over-house\">begin to slowly open back up</a>, Australia\u2019s arts industry is still largely in lockdown \u2013 and the music industry was hit harder, and earlier, than most others.

Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day although British adults manage to eat only around 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can\u2019t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre.

In early March, residents began to fall ill from coronavirus, eventually resulting in 36 deaths. Locals believe the cluster, which is the second worst in England and Wales according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics, does not account for the true scale of the devastation, as it does not factor in people who work in Church End but live nearby. </p><p>Aamna met <strong>Rhoda Ibrahim</strong>, a 57-year old community leader who has been left devastated by the deaths of so many people she knew. The virus thrived on the structural inequalities that Ibrahim has spent much of her life fighting against. It flourished in a housing crisis that was 40 years in the making, stark in-work poverty that left many struggling to put food on the table, and deeply entrenched racial inequalities. The council leader, <strong>Muhammed Butt</strong>, believes the government\u2019s failure to provide tailored support to communities such as those in Brent worsened the situation, and that the country should have gone into lockdown earlier.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/jul/03/how-one-neighbourhood-brent-london-lost-36-residents-to-covid-19\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/audio/2020/jul/03/how-one-neighbourhood-brent-london-lost-36-residents-to-covid-19", "date_published": "2020-07-03 02:00:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
