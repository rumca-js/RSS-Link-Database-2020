Our Friday Night Concerts pick for July 17, 2020, comes from Rock the Garden 2015; we'll hear a set by Babes in Toyland and a set by Courtney Barnett. As a preview of what's to come on tonight's broadcast, here are two songs from Babes in Toyland's set – including a song whose name became the band name of another hard-rocking Minneapolis band inspired by Babes in Toyland. And as you're watching these performances, you've gotta ask yourself: Is there a more joyful drummer than Lori Barbero? 

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Bruise Violet"
3:59 "Sweet '69"

PERSONNEL
Kat Bjelland – vocals, guitar
