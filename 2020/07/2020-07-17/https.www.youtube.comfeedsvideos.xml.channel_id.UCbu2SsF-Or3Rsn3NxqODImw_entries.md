There's a vast, beautiful island to explore and many battles to fight in Ghost of Tsushima, but even with its traditional open world trappings, you may need a bit more than the wind to guide you. From some basic habits that'll give you the upper hand in combat to systems to be mindful of as you progress through the game, the video above outlines the things you need to know before starting Ghost of Tsushima.

When it comes to combat--one of the game's strengths--it's best that you keep a few things in mind: change your stance against corresponding enemies, take out archers first, snag the Mizu-no-Kami charm to making parrying easier, and use smoke bombs as an offensive tool for assassinations. When you're out and about, put on your Traveler's attire to uncover more of the map and reveal key locations more easily--you can also just consult our locations guides for hot springs (max health boost), bamboo strikes (max resolve increase), shinto shrines (new charms), and more.

These are just some of the basics to get you started on the right foot in the early goings of the PS4-exclusive Ghost of Tsushima. If you want to start chopping down enemies in fancier, more efficient style, you'll definitely want to check out our Ghost of Tsushima advanced combat guide. We also compiled all of our other walkthroughs and guides for Ghost of Tsushima so you can find everything you need to know in one spot.

On Today's Save State, Persia talks about the possibility of Dr. Disrespect taking legal action against Twitch, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate including xCloud support, and the delay of Destiny 2's next big expansion, Beyond Light.

Persia talks about Dr. Disrespect's most recent interview, where he said he is considering taking legal action against Twitch. It has been three weeks since the sudden Twitch ban and there has been no official explanation, but that is not stopping Doc from continuing his livestreaming and content creation. He spoke about "Doc 3.0" and how he will be returning in epic fashion, promising big surprises. 

Persia also goes over the new addition of xCloud support for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. That means you'll be able to play the Game Pass library on your phone or tablet, with controller support and online play through Xbox Live servers. You'll even be able to pick up your progress right where you left off through cloud saves. 

And finally, Persia talks about the delay of Destiny 2: Beyond Light. Bungie announced on its website that the game’s next big expansion has been delayed to November 10 across all platforms, including PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
