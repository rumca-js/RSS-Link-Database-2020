England and Wales, w/e 3 July 2020 (Week 27)

Community based survey (not hospitals or care homes)

Deaths involving COVID-19, 532 (5.8% of all deaths in that week)

8th July, 24,000 infections, antigen testing, (1 in 2,300 of the population).

Estimated 1,700 new cases of COVID-19 per day, equivalent to 1 in every 5,000

Modelling shows evidence that the decrease in COVID-19 rates has levelled off

COVID-19 Infection Survey
https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26#infectionstudy

Data up to 8th July

Based on 4,309 blood samples received since the start of the study on 26 April 2020

1 in 16 people (6.3%) who provided blood samples up to 8 July 2020 tested positive for 
COVID-19 antibodies

This equates to 2.8 million people in England

Face coverings when outside the home
 https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26#infectionstudy

8 to 12 July 2020

61% reported wearing a face covering when leaving their home in the past seven days
up from 52% the week before.

10% had used a pub or restaurant

9% hairdresser

Oxford Vaccine Group, Coronavirus immunity in children

https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/ovg-study-sheds-light-on-coronavirus-immunity-in-children


Oxford Vaccine Group, Public Health England, National Institute for Health Research

750 families in the trial

Prevalence of COVID-19 in children

Checking for coronavirus antibodies

3 % to 4 % of children tested positive for antibodies

Possible underestimate

Higher percentage in London

Of those who tested positive, fewer than 10 % showed any symptoms of COVID-19

Therefore children have similar infection rates to adults but a higher proportion are asymptomatic

Very few children and teenagers are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms

Less ACE-2 receptors

Cross immunity with other recent coronaviruses

Children are very good at spreading the influenza virus

But not so good at spreading COVID-19


Memory T cells

May mean we have more immunity than antibodies indicate

Stockholm
https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/ovg-study-sheds-light-on-coronavirus-immunity-in-children

IgM first 23 days

IgG up to 49 days

Blood donors in May

15% had antibodies, 30% had memory T cells

COVID-19 will probably be a long-term feature of people’s lives

‘There’s a very high likelihood that come winter, we will see an increase in cases’

“And I think it’s quite probable that we will see this virus coming back in different waves over a number of years.”

A fresh spike in cases later this year would still be part of the first wave

“All we have done is suppress the first wave and when you take the brakes off, you would expect it to come back.”

Chris Whitty

Viral circulation, “winter and into next spring”

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam

(England’s deputy chief medical officer)

“The reality is, until we get a vaccine, and only if we get a vaccine that is really capable of suppressing disease levels, will we ever be ‘out of this’

“From that perspective, we may have to live, and learn to live, with this virus in the long-term. Certainly for many months to come, if not years.”

DCD director (Robert Redfield)

Fall and winter, one of the most difficult times we have experienced

Moderna / National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases

Vaccine appeared to offer the type of protection seen in a natural infection

Theoretically, the best vaccine you could possibly ever get is a natural infection (Fauci)

Moderna’s candidate has had millions of dollars in backing from Operation Warp Speed

“I feel good about the projected timetable.”

Fauci, “What we’re doing with vaccines, therapeutics, clinical trials is the real substance”
