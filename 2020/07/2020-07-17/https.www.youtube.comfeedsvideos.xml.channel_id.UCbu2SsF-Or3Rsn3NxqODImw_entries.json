From some basic habits that'll give you the upper hand in combat to systems to be mindful of as you progress through the game, the video above outlines the things you need to know before starting Ghost of Tsushima.\n\nWhen it comes to combat--one of the game's strengths--it's best that you keep a few things in mind: change your stance against corresponding enemies, take out archers first, snag the Mizu-no-Kami charm to making parrying easier, and use smoke bombs as an offensive tool for assassinations. When you're out and about, put on your Traveler's attire to uncover more of the map and reveal key locations more easily--you can also just consult our locations guides for hot springs (max health boost), bamboo strikes (max resolve increase), shinto shrines (new charms), and more.\n\nThese are just some of the basics to get you started on the right foot in the early goings of the PS4-exclusive Ghost of Tsushima. If you want to start chopping down enemies in fancier, more efficient style, you'll definitely want to check out our Ghost of Tsushima advanced combat guide. We also compiled all of our other walkthroughs and guides for Ghost of Tsushima so you can find everything you need to know in one spot.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-zJc99dFJc", "date_published": "2020-07-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla - Official 4K Character Trailer | \"Eivor\u2019s Fate\"", "description": "Fate will take Eivor far from home, to a broken land of power, mystics, and legends.\n\nAssassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla will be available November 17, 2020 on Xbox One, Playstation 4, PC and Stadia.

It has been three weeks since the sudden Twitch ban and there has been no official explanation, but that is not stopping Doc from continuing his livestreaming and content creation. He spoke about \"Doc 3.0\" and how he will be returning in epic fashion, promising big surprises. \n\nPersia also goes over the new addition of xCloud support for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers. That means you'll be able to play the Game Pass library on your phone or tablet, with controller support and online play through Xbox Live servers. You'll even be able to pick up your progress right where you left off through cloud saves. \n\nAnd finally, Persia talks about the delay of Destiny 2: Beyond Light.
