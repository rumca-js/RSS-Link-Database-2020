<p>There’s a reason our gut is known as the ‘second brain’ – what you eat has an effect on your mind</p><p>The idea that many of our emotions and feelings are linked to the gut is an ancient one. More than 2,000 years ago, the Romans made reference to what we today describe as a “gut feeling”. Now, modern science indicates that the gut may indeed play a role in mood disorders and our mental health.</p><p>The gut is covered in nerve cells known as neurons – cells that transmit signals to other neurons, and which are also fundamental to our brains. <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/09/your-gut-directly-connected-your-brain-newly-discovered-neuron-circuit" rel="nofollow">Research</a> suggests that this network, known as the enteric nervous system, contains more than 100m neurons. This complex network of cells in our gut is able to function independently of the brain and spinal cord, and is often referred to as the body’s “second brain”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/go-with-your-gut/2020/jul/17/gut-instinct-how-your-diet-shapes-your-mind">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A portrait of Lisbon, saudade and the fado folk music of the city and its relationship with tourism. <a href="http://www.henrikisielewski.com/">Henri Kisielewski</a> is the 2019 recipient of the Joan Wakelin bursary, administrated in partnership with the <a href="https://rps.org/">Royal Photographic Society</a></p><p>Fado is Lisbon’s urban folk music, born in and around the brothels, alleyways and ​<em>tascas ​</em>of the city’s poorest neighbourhoods. Fado is to Lisbon what the Blues are to the Delta. Written records trace it back to the early 19th century, though some argue it is much older, connecting it to oral traditions imported from across the Portuguese empire.</p><p>At the heart of fado is ​<em>saudade.​ </em>This elusive word – apparently untranslatable from the original Portuguese – broadly refers to a sense of sorrow, of yearning, and a resigned desire for what once was. This is the underlying emotion of all fado and perhaps of Lisbon itself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/17/lisbon-back-alley-fado-legends-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

<p>He was once the embodiment of youthful rage and rebellion. Now, the Clockwork Orange star is reconciled to a life of golf, gangster flicks and the odd glimpse of genius</p><p>Malcolm McDowell was the insolent prince of early-70s cinema, the Liverpool salesman who stormed the establishment’s barricades. You can see him on screen in Lindsay Anderson’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_68miSOU78">If….</a>, kickstarting a bloody revolution inside an English public school. You can see him in Stanley Kubrick’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN-1Mup0UI0">A Clockwork Orange</a>, hanging with his droogs at the Korova milk-bar, making up his <em>rassoodock</em> what to do with the night. The sky was the limit. The world was his oyster. One felt he could achieve pretty much anything.</p><p>If McDowell’s life was a movie, he would either have gone on to be crowned king or he would have exploded and vanished, ideally before he turned 30. But real life has a way of monkeying with the script, which may explain why McDowell is now a snowy-haired 77-year-old. He is a father of five, an avid golfer and a jobbing Hollywood actor specialising in baddies. His wild youth is behind him. He has made peace with his lot. “I had an incredible first few years,” he explains. “And of course that was the golden age. But you can’t keep playing the rebel for ever.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/17/malcolm-mcdowell-i-have-no-memory-of-doing-most-of-my-films">Continue reading...</a>
