GrapheneOS is a mobile operating system focused on user privacy and security. It is based on Android Open Source Project but it is completely devoid of any and all Google apps. This video will give you a thorough introduction into GrapheneOS, overview of the system and tutorial on how to install GrapheneOS on a Google Pixel phone. In this case, I am installing GrapheneOS on Google Pixel 3a.
