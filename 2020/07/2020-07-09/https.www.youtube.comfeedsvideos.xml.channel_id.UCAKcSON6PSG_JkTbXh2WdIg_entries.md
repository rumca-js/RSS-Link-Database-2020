Andrew Bird's birthday is July 11, and in honor of that, we look back to April 2016, when Andrew Bird visited our studio to perform this stripped-down set in support of his album "Are You Serious."

Bird — who said he gravitates toward the kitchen when thinking creatively — said writing is rarely a conscious effort. "All of my songs are personal; it's just a matter of how close to the surface those personal things are."

Though he lives in Los Angeles, Bird said he feels most at home on his farm in Illinois. The most California thing he's ever done was try surfing – it wasn't for him. But Bird doesn't believe his relatively new environment affected "Are You Serious." Whether it's hiking around Griffith Park or living amid the Midwestern plains, Bird still soars.

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Are You Serious"
4:44 "Roma Fade"
9:09 "Capsized"
