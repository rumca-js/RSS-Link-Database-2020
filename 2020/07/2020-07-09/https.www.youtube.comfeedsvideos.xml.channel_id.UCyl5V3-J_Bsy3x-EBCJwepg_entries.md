Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan are joined by The Babylon Bee Senior Writer Frank J. Fleming to talk about the week’s big stories like Kanye West declaring a run for the Presidency, how modern Americans are definitely morally superior to slaveowners from 200 years ago, and why a Russian grandmother was caught smearing poo on playground swings.  They also talk about how the rich and the powerful can say whatever they want and then in the subscriber portion they talk about all of Frank’s problematic writings.

Frank has a new book Superego: Fathom which is a sequel to his book Superego.
