Half-Life Alyx got rave reviews, but Half-Life 3 could have been quite different. Valve went through several Half-Life 3 iterations since Episode 2 in 2007, and one of them was a procedurally generated rogue-lite game. \n\nIt\u2019s a good time for our favorite Bandicoot - Not only are we getting Crash 4: It's About Time, but we're also getting Crash Bandicoot: On the Run on mobile, coming to iOS and android. \n\nPlay For All schedule: https://www.gamespot.com/play-for-all\n\nBuy cool Play For All merch, all proceeds go to charity! https://store.gamespot.com/\n\nWhere to donate: \nBLACK LIVES MATTER: http://bit.ly/gs-blm\n \nCOVID-19 Direct Relief: http://bit.ly/gs-covid", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EMj9_R9ogU", "date_published": "2020-07-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "The Best Games Of 2020 So Far - GameSpot After Dark #49", "description": "On this week's episode of GameSpot After Dark, Blessing Adeoye, Jr. joins us to talk about some of our favorite games of 2020 so far.\n\n\nChapters:\n00:00:00 - Introduction\n00:05:23 - What We've Been Playing\n00:05:45 - Sims 4\n00:18:42 - Slay The Spire on iOS\n00:26:31 - Hyper Scape\n00:37:24 - Iron Man VR\n00:41:18 - Deep Rock Galactic\n00:44:19 - Civilization 6\n00:48:16 - Best Games of 2020 So Far...\n01:33:52 - Listener Questions", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nd0uf0G7w_I", "date_published": "2020-07-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Chris Pine As Nathan Drake? | Save State", "description": "Uncharted voice actor Nolan North thinks Chris Pine would make a great Nathan Drake in an Uncharted film, Dark Pictures: Little Hope has a new release date, and World of Warcraft: Shadowlands get lots of new details.\n\nThere's already an Uncharted film in the works with Tom Holland staring as a young Nathan Drake, but the game's voice actor Nolan North thinks Chris Pine would be a great adult Drake. The movie is slated for a July 2021 release, but it's easy to assume it'll get delayed due to COVID. Speaking of delays, the next installment in the Dark Pictures anthology games, Little Hope, was pushed back to October 30, 2020. News of the delay came with the announcement of new pre-order details including three different versions.\n\nHere's an interview that Kurt Indovina did with the game's actor Will Poulter: https://youtu.be/mqnIxbAYrNU\n\nWorld of Warcraft's next expansion, Shadowlands, gets lots of new details, including a look into the game's new dungeons, covenant system, and more. There's still no release date for the expansion, but it'll be going into beta very soon.\n\nMeanwhile, Play For All keeps on trucking.

In this video we go through some of the funniest spoiler-free moments in the early game.\n\nNintendo games have never shied away from being funny, including recent examples like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but in a lot of ways humor defines the Paper Mario series. Enemies will talk to Mario like they\u2019re both people living their lives and doing what they need to do. Some enemies are even fans of Mario and let him know as much. \n\nOne of the new characters introduced in The Origami King, Olivia, is very bright and cheerful but can sometimes be a bit clueless, which adds to her charm and makes for some funny banter between her and other characters. This video does not contain any spoilers for the game and focuses primarily on the earlier sections with banter between characters.\n\nPaper Mario: The Origami King will be released for Nintendo Switch on July 17, 2020.
