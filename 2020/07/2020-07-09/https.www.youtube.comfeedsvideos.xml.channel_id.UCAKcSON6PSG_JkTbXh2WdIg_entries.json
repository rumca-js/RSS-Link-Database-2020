The most California thing he's ever done was try surfing \u2013 it wasn't for him. But Bird doesn't believe his relatively new environment affected \"Are You Serious.\" Whether it's hiking around Griffith Park or living amid the Midwestern plains, Bird still soars.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Are You Serious\"\n4:44 \"Roma Fade\"\n9:09 \"Capsized\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nAndrew Bird \u2013 vocals, violin, whistling\nAlan Hampton \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nSteve Elliot \u2013 guitar, backing vocals\nKevin O'Donnell - drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2012 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/12/17/andrew-bird\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/04/19/andrew-bird-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2019 set at The Current's Day Party during SXSW in Austin, Texas:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/03/16/watch-andrew-bird-perform-at-the-current-day-party-in-austin-texas-sxsw\n2019 concert at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minn.:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/09/27/watch-andrew-bird-live-in-concert-at-the-palace-theatre\n2020 live virtual session:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2020/05/07/live-virtual-session-andrew-bird\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5nNb9aA0B4", "date_published": "2020-07-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Interview: Aaron Dessner and Michael Stipe", "description": "Host Jade interviews Aaron Dessner (the National; Big Red Machine) and Michael Stipe (formerly of R.E.M.) about their collaborative project with Big Red Machine.\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RadioHeartlandMPR/\nhttps://twitter.com/RadioHeartland", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3r6Uf96eg8", "date_published": "2020-07-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "The Jayhawks - Live Virtual Session", "description": "On the week of the release of their latest album, 'XOXO,' the Jayhawks perform a very special Live Virtual Session.
