In this GameSpot exclusive for Devolver Digital's reverse-horror game, Carrion, we have an extended look at the game's grotesque and over-the-top action where you play as a mutating blob on the loose in a secret facility filled with unsuspecting humans. Launching on July 23 for PC, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch, Carrion is a unique horror game that puts you the role of the monster who has to wipe out everything in its path.

Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing In Disguise is a welcoming return to its strange and absurd world, but feels diluted and missing many of the flavor notes that defined its predecessor.

Kurt Indovina consumed many cups of coffee during his 50 hour playthrough of Deadly Premonition 2: A Blessing In Disguise, accompanied with moments of laughter, frustration, and heartache.

Here's our first look at PS5 game boxes, Half-Life 3 could have been a rogue-lite, and mobile runner Crash Bandicoot: On The Run has been announced.

In today's Save State, Sony revealed what a PS5 physical game box looks like, showing off Spider-Man: Miles Morales. Half-Life Alyx got rave reviews, but Half-Life 3 could have been quite different. Valve went through several Half-Life 3 iterations since Episode 2 in 2007, and one of them was a procedurally generated rogue-lite game. 

It’s a good time for our favorite Bandicoot - Not only are we getting Crash 4: It's About Time, but we're also getting Crash Bandicoot: On the Run on mobile, coming to iOS and android.
