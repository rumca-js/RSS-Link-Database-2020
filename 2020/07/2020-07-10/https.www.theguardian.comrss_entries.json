Or maybe his biggest Australian money-spinner was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/27/dingo-baby-case-meryl-streep\">A Cry in the Dark</a>, in which he and Meryl Streep did some of their fiercest work as the real-life couple falsely accused of killing their own baby and blaming it on dingoes. There was Aussie money, too, in Jane Campion\u2019s Oscar-winning The Piano, featuring Neill as a cuckolded colonialist.

At first, it appears closer in theme and style to the semi-autobiographical <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/16/fiction.davidmitchell\">Black Swan Green</a></em> than to the giddying, multivalent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/fiction.asbyatt\">Cloud Atlas</a></em> or <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/15/thousand-autumns-jacob-david-mitchell\">The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</a></em>: it is placed firmly and with pleasing particularity in the 1960s, and is in effect a coming-of-age novel. What comes of age is Utopia Avenue, \u201cthe most curious British band you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d. The band comprises the middle-class folk singer Elf Holloway, who calls to mind <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/08/sandy-denny-folk-music-singer\">Sandy Denny</a>, and who is cautiously examining her sexuality; Jasper de Zoet, whose genius on lead guitar is compromised by aural hallucinations; Dean Moss, bassist, not yet wrenched out of his traumatising family past; and the drummer Griff, who is of the four the most opaque, though we are assured he is a Yorkshireman.</p><p>They are brought together and in due course managed by Levon Frankland, previously seen as a much older man in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/sep/02/the-bone-clocks-david-mitchell-review-novel\">The Bone Clocks</a></em>, whose fur hat and blue glasses Dean worriedly parses as those of \u201ca queer beatnik\u201d. An immense cast \u2013 drawn from homes in Kent, clubs in the West End and parties in New York \u2013 attends the band, as Mitchell traces Utopia Avenue\u2019s uneven trajectory from the Gravesend Working Men\u2019s Club and the bar at Brighton Polytechnic via Italy to Manhattan, which seems from the air to float \u201con glassy dark, a raft laden with skyscrapers\u201d. The band acquire success, ardent fans and a degree of pleasant notoriety, but not \u2013 of course \u2013 happiness; and Mitchell is expert at excavating the seams of loss, ambition and mere chance that lie under the edifice of fame. Each member experiences the irresolvable tensions between the demands and rewards of art and ambition, and the opposing forces of duty, failure and sorrow. Death arrives suddenly; love is offered, withdrawn and squandered.
