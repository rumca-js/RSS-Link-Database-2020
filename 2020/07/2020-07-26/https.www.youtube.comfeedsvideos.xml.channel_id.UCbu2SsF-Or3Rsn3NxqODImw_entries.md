The release of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is coming up in just a few short months, introducing you to the world of Vikings and putting you into the boots of protagonist Eivor. But who is this legendary warrior and what can we expect from their journey?

In a new video, Jess covers seven big things we learned about Eivor. The video touches on Eivor’s history as a leader from Norway who hopes to settle Anglo-Saxon England. The video includes quotes from Valhalla’s writer, Darby McDevitt, who shared new details on Eivor’s personality.

Also in the video, Jess talks about Eivor’s unique combat style--which is much more brutal and aggressive than that of Kassandra or Alexios from AC: Odyssey. We also learn more about Eivor’s romantic opportunities, the mystery of Eivor’s flexible DNA, and Eivor’s deadly ambition.
