SACN vitamin D and health report

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sacn-vitamin-d-and-health-report

A reference nutrient intake (RNI) of 10 micrograms (400 units) of vitamin D per day, throughout the year, for everyone in the general population aged 4 years and older

The RNI and safe intakes were developed to ensure that the majority of the UK population has enough vitamin D to protect musculoskeletal health, all year round.

SACN did not take account of sunlight exposure in making recommendations because of the number and complexity of factors that affect skin synthesis of vitamin D.

Evaluation, treatment, and prevention of vitamin D deficiency: an Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline (2011)

The Endocrine Society

Journal of Clinical Endocrinology

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21646368/

Vitamin D deficiency is very common in all age groups

Few foods contain vitamin D

Task Force recommended supplementation, depending on age and clinical circumstances

Measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D level, in patients at risk for deficiency

Treatment with supplement recommended for deficient patients

https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-vitamin-d-to-take#How-Common-Is-Vitamin-D-Deficiency

About 42% of the US population is vitamin D deficient

82% in black people

70% in Hispanics

Immunologic Effects of Vitamin D on Human Health and Disease

Calcium and phosphate metabolism, bones

Immunomodulatory hormone

Innate and adaptive immune systems

Vitamin D receptor and enzymes in; 

Lymphocytes
NKs

Association with low blood levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D

Several immune-related diseases and disorders

Psoriasis,

Type 1 diabetes

Multiple sclerosis

Tuberculosis

Sepsis

Respiratory infection

COVID-19

Optimal Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D 

It is advisable to increase vitamin D intake and have sensible sunlight exposure 

Maintain serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D at least,

30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L)

and preferably

40–60 ng/mL (100–150 nmol/L)

Recommended dosage for vitamin D intake in individuals who are at risk for vitamin D
Deficiency (1,000 iu = 25 mcg)

Age, years Daily requirement Upper limit
Years  Requirement  

0 – 1   400 – 1,000   2,000
1 – 18   600 – 1,000   4,000
18 +  1500- 2000   10,000
Obese  4,000 – 6000  10,000

For deficiency 0 – 1 year

2000 IU/day or 50,000 IU/week

of vitamin D2 or D3 for at least 6 weeks

to achieve serum 25(OH)D more than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L)

maintenance therapy of 400–1000 IU/d

For deficiency 1 – 18 years

2000 IU/day or 50,000 IU/week of vitamin D2 or D3 for at least 6 weeks 

to achieve serum 25(OH)D more than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L)

maintenance therapy of 600–1000 IU/d

For deficiency after 18 years

6000 IU/day or 50,000 IU/week 

of vitamin D2 or D3 for 8 weeks

to achieve serum 25(OH)D more than 30 ng/mL (75 nmol/L)

maintenance therapy of 1500 –2000 IU/d

Obese and malabsorptive patients

Dosage should be increased by 2–3 times


Respiratory Viral Infection and COVID-19

Outbreak of influenza infection is periodic and usually occurs during the wintertime at higher latitudes

but is sporadic throughout the year in the tropical area

Association between low level of serum 25(OH)D and
incidence and severity of respiratory tract infection in children and adults

A recent meta-analysis of 25 RCTs showed that supplementation of vitamin D2 or D3 can protect against the development of acute respiratory tract infection compared with placebo

COVID

Rate of symptomatic infection, morbidity and mortality observed

African American

Obesity

Worldwide on average approximately 40% of children and adults have circulating levels of 25(OH)D less than 20 ng/mL (50 nmol/L)

It is therefore reasonable to institute as a standard of care to give at least one single dose of 50,000 of vitamin D to all COVID-19 patients as soon as possible after being hospitalized

Obesity Is a Risk Factor for Severe COVID-19 Infection

Obesity

French study

BMI more than 35 compared with BMI less than 25 kg/m2

7 fold increased risk for mechanical ventilation 

New York study, (in under 60s)

BMI, 30 to 34, 1.8 times more likely to be admitted to CCU

BMI, more than 35, 3.6 times more likely to be admitted to CCU


Obesity

Calories on beer and wine

Britons will be encouraged to pay attention to 'hidden' calories in food and drink

10 per cent of calories now consumed in alcoholic drinks.

14% increase in sales since lockdown began

More than a third of children overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school

Two in three adults. 

28 % of adults in England obese

Almost twice as many as in 1993

Protein, 4 calories per gram

Carbohydrates, 4 calories per gram

Fat, 9 calories per gram

Fibre, 2 calories per gram

Ethanol, 7 calories per gram

10 ml of ethanol = 8 grams of ethanol

200 mls of wine at 12 % = 24 mls of ethanol

200 mls of wine at 12 % = 20 grams of ethanol

20 (grams) x 7 (calories) = 140 calories

Dr. Fauci

States hit hard by the virus in recent weeks needed to halt or walk back their reopenings

A vaccine would likely not be “widely available” until “several months in” to 2021

Need to stop taking half actions

Shut it down now (500 health experts to president) 

LA

No plans for additional shutdowns

CDC

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm

Relatively little is known about the clinical course of COVID-19 and return to baseline health for persons with milder, outpatient illness.

Multistate telephone survey of symptomatic adults who had a positive outpatient test

35% had not returned to their usual state of health 2–3 weeks after testing

Among 18–34 years with no chronic medical conditions, one in five had not returned to their usual state of health

Therefore

COVID-19 can result in prolonged illness, even among young adults without underlying chronic medical conditions. 

Effective public health messaging targeting these groups is warranted.

Executive order lowering drug prices

Test results

Should be 4 days but up to 2 weeks

“I am very concerned right now that we are beginning to see an acceleration of disease in Africa,” Michael Ryan


If you see me wearing a mask in public and in the shops, I want you to know that...

I'm educated enough to know that I could be asymptomatic and still give you the virus.

No, I don't "live in fear" of the virus; I just want to be part of the solution, not the problem.

I don't feel like the "government controls me". I feel like I'm an adult contributing to security in our society and I want to teach others the same.

If we could all live with the consideration of others in mind, the whole world would be a much better place.

Wearing a mask doesn't make me weak, scared, stupid or even "controlled". It makes me caring.

When you think about your appearance, discomfort, or other people's opinion of you, imagine a loved one - a child, father, mother, grandparent, aunt, uncle or even a stranger - placed on a ventilator, alone without you or any family member who is allowed at his bedside.

Ask yourself if you could have helped them a little while wearing a mask.

If simply wearing a mask helps even half of all the anxious and worried people get back out there to live their lives, and strengthens our economy in the process, then I'm happy to make them feel more comfortable.
