The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 27, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- To me, it's still thrilling to see a concert in an office — even if it's not the one, back at NPR, that I'm used to. Lucinda Williams and her guitar mate, Stuart Mathis, set up shop for this performance at Thirty Tigers' headquarters in Nashville, a place usually filled with artist managers and folks who distribute music, including hers.

Lucinda kicks off this Tiny Desk (home) concert with a nod to the present moment, a song called "Bad News Blues" from her 2020 release, Good Souls Better Angels:

Fools and thieves and clowns and hypocrites,
Gluttony and greed, and that ain't the worst of it.

When it closes, Lucinda says, "we've had our share of bad news, even before this lockdown thing." The COVID-19 crisis has kept her from seeing her other bandmates, who are out in California, but this minimalist pairing, of Lucinda's voice and Stuart's sliding blues, is quite the treat.

SET LIST
"Bad News Blues"
"Big Black Train"
"You Can't Rule Me"
"Man Without A Soul"

MUSICIANS
Lucinda Williams - vocals, guitar; Stuart Mathis - guitar

We've been filming Tiny Desk concerts for more than 10 years. While revisiting our archives, we discovered that some of our earliest concerts never made it to YouTube!

Bob Boilen | August 9, 2010
Mavis Staples is a legend, but she's not stuck in the past. You probably know her work with her family band, The Staple Singers, which was all over the radio in the '70s with hits like "Respect Yourself," "Let's Do It Again" and "I'll Take You There" (which she excerpts in her performance here).

What you may not know is that Mavis Staples has been actively working with her fellow Chicago musician (and Wilco leader) Jeff Tweedy on her upcoming album, You Are Not Alone. Tweedy produced the record and wrote a few songs for her, as well — including the title track, which she sings here.

The album was recorded at Wilco's studio, The Loft, and it includes songs by John Fogerty, Randy Newman, Rev. Gary Davis, Allen Toussaint and Pops Staples. You Are Not Alone also features a fine guest roster, including not only Tweedy (on bass, guitar and vocals), but also Nora O'Connor, Kelly Hogan and Wilco's Patrick Sansone on keys and vibes.

Rick Holmstrom, the skilled guitarist who accompanies Staples here, also plays on the record and in her touring band. And while You Are Not Alone doesn't come out until Sept. 14, you can get a good idea of what a treat it is by watching this stripped-down but soulful Tiny Desk concert.

Set List
"Only the Lord Knows"
"You Are Not Alone"
"I'll Take You There"
