But who is this legendary warrior and what can we expect from their journey?\n\nIn a new video, Jess covers seven big things we learned about Eivor. The video touches on Eivor\u2019s history as a leader from Norway who hopes to settle Anglo-Saxon England. The video includes quotes from Valhalla\u2019s writer, Darby McDevitt, who shared new details on Eivor\u2019s personality.\n\nAlso in the video, Jess talks about Eivor\u2019s unique combat style--which is much more brutal and aggressive than that of Kassandra or Alexios from AC: Odyssey. We also learn more about Eivor\u2019s romantic opportunities, the mystery of Eivor\u2019s flexible DNA, and Eivor\u2019s deadly ambition.\n\nIf you want to know more about how it\u2019s all going to go down, check out our other features on Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla including our full impressions, and let us know who your all time favourite AC protagonist is and why down in that comment box.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQKDzHDRggw", "date_published": "2020-07-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
