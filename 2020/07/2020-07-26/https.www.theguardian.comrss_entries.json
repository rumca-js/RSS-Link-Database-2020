Britain has been here before</a>, 23 Juy) provides a welcome reminder of the BSE crisis and government science advisers \u201cconfusing a lack of evidence of risk or benefit for a lack of risk or benefit\u201d. However, scientists are not the only people who assess risk. People make risk assessments every day, and the Covid-19 crisis has shown how people do this. Risk assessments are socially constructed and these different assessments need to be considered in public policymaking. For instance, where were any representatives of older people or people with disabilities when the decision was made to send a text asking them to stay indoors for three months?</p><p>This crisis will be characterised by the absence of public health expertise, but a second defining feature will be the lack of public input into policy decisions affecting millions of people. Scientific experts must not only be able to explain the strengths and weaknesses of evidence, but must also debate the implications of the evidence, with the public coming to a consensus. Democratic expertise is needed, rather than leaving experts to solve these problems alone.<br /><strong>Dr Jane Lethbridge</strong><br /><em>University of Greenwich</em></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/covid-19-trust-the-public-on-scientific-uncertainty\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/covid-19-trust-the-public-on-scientific-uncertainty", "date_published": "2020-07-26 16:35:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Olivia de Havilland: what it's like working for a Hollywood legend | Hannah Partos", "description": "<p>As as scruffy student in Paris, I was lucky enough to land a job as the personal assistant to the Gone With the Wind star, then in her 90s \u2013 and still a tremendous performer</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/26/olivia-de-havilland-star-of-gone-with-the-wind-dies-at-104\">Olivia de Havilland, star of Gone with the Wind, dies at 104</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2020/jul/26/olivia-de-havilland-a-life-in-pictures\">A life in pictures</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/jul/01/olivia-de-havilland-100-years-old-gone-with-the-wind\">Peter Bradshaw on Olivia de Havilland: Hollywood\u2019s queen of radiant calm</a></li></ul><p>It is 2011 and I am a student in Paris, teaching English for a year and renting a small flat only two metro stops from Olivia de Havilland\u2019s residence.

But as soon as you lift your face and taste the fresh tang of salt on the air, you will mark how this sky is as different, fickle and changeable as all you have left behind. Then, if you listen, you will hear the laughing gulls. And beyond that, heading off in a low V-shape, the haunting call of the geese.</p><p>I have lived in the Hebrides for more than 16 years \u2013 the first years with my husband, and for the past decade with my dog, Maude, alone. I had been dreaming of staring out at a raw, open horizon for years \u2013 ever since I found an old map of Scotland and pinned it up in the hallway in my London flat. It was positioned across the full length of a narrow wall where I always saw it as I was passing, at an angle where your eyes fell into that empty space between giant masses of land. It is always during that notion of transit, of passing from one space to another, that your heart opens and all of your dreaming begins. I would press my nose to that thick paper, inhaling its musty scent, as my finger traced the ragged coastline of the fractured islets and islands. In those moments, as my eyes closed, the traffic, shouts from the street, neighbours slamming doors, would evaporate into the hurl of fresh spindrift, the thick, curling crests of the breakers drenching the salt-stung air, the gulls tearing the skies apart with an aching, screaming call.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/26/i-ran-away-to-a-remote-scottish-island-it-was-perfect\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/26/i-ran-away-to-a-remote-scottish-island-it-was-perfect", "date_published": "2020-07-26 09:00:20+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018We\u2019re living in fear\u2019: LGBT people in Italy pin hopes on new law", "description": "<p>Debate on long-awaited bill that would punish discrimination and hate crimes towards LGBT people opens on Monday<br /></p><p>For 15 years, Marco and his boyfriend had lived together fairly peacefully in a town outside Rome.
