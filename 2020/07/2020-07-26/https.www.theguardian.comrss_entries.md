## The Guardian view on a wealth tax: necessary but not sufficient | Editorial

<p>As in the novels of Jane Austen, social mobility in Britain today appears dependent on the wealth you inherit or marry in to, rather than how much you can set aside from a pay packet</p><p>In the 1970s British households held wealth worth around three times the nation’s GDP. Today it’s <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/app/uploads/2019/12/Who-owns-all-the-pie.pdf" title="">more than seven times</a>, the highest such ratio in over a century. People in the top 10% of society have £2.5m, on average, in wealth. The bottom 10% have virtually nothing. The gap cannot currently be made up by saving. As in the novels of Jane Austen, social mobility appears dependent on the wealth you inherit or marry in to, rather than how much you can set aside from wages.</p><p>Just how significant this trend has become was highlighted by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/inequality/2020/jul/22/one-in-10-born-in-80s-to-inherit-more-than-half-average-lifetime-earnings" title="">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a>, which last week said as many as one in 10 UK adults born in the 1980s will inherit more than half as much money from their parents as the average person earns in a lifetime. Those born 20 years earlier in the top decile had received less than a third of average lifetime earnings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/26/the-guardian-view-on-a-wealth-tax-necessary-but-not-sufficient">Continue reading...</a>

## Bournemouth's victory in vain as five-year stay in top flight comes to an end

<p>It was on the long walk out of Goodison Park towards the temporary changing room behind the Park End Stand that Bournemouth discovered their five-year residence in the Premier League was over. Eddie Howe’s side delivered as they had to, ending Everton’s 11-game unbeaten home run and recording the club’s first ever win at Goodison, but there would be no helping hand from elsewhere.</p><p>Bournemouth thoroughly merited the win that ended Carlo Ancelotti’s own unbeaten home run as Everton manager but the damage had been inflicted before their arrival on Merseyside. Four points from a possible 24 since the restart had left the visitors reliant on slip-ups from Aston Villa and Watford in their bid for survival. They were not obliged. Josh King, Dominic Solanke and Junior Stanislas all scored to give Bournemouth a fourth away win of the season but, with news of Villa’s point at West Ham filtering through as they headed off the pitch, this was a triumph greeted in almost total silence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/26/everton-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on China and the Uighurs: everyone’s business

<p>At last the world is beginning to react to the mounting evidence of horrific human rights abuses in Xinjiang <br /></p><p>It has taken too many horrors, but at last the world is paying heed to China’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jul/24/why-more-than-1-million-uighurs-are-being-held-in-camps-in-china-video-explainer" title="">treatment of the Uighurs</a>. Satellite pictures of detention camps, and procurement requests for spiked clubs, have been supplemented by leaked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/24/china-cables-leak-no-escapes-reality-china-uighur-prison-camp" title="">internal documents</a> warning “allow no escapes”, and growing testimony from relatives and former inmates whose desperation has overcome their fear of retaliation for speaking out.</p><p>What once, perhaps, seemed remote and opaque to those in other countries has become much more immediate. The crackdown in Hong Kong, taking place in the public eye, has highlighted the ruthlessness of the Communist party’s response to perceived challenges. Reports of the forced use of IUDs, sterilisation and abortion suggests a <a href="https://apnews.com/269b3de1af34e17c1941a514f78d764c" title="">campaign to slash birth rates</a> among Uighurs and other minorities, which some experts have described as “demographic genocide”. Last week a coalition of rights groups <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jul/23/virtually-entire-fashion-industry-complicit-in-uighur-forced-labour-say-rights-groups-china" title="">warned</a> that virtually the entire fashion industry is complicit in abuses, due to the use of forced labour in Xinjiang’s mammoth cotton industry. It is harder to turn your back on people who made the shirt upon it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/26/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-the-uighurs-everyones-business">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The full-time whistle blew. One or two of the Aston Villa players let out a roar of celebration, only to be swiftly hushed by manager Dean Smith, warning them the job was still contingent on results elsewhere. For two agonising minutes, Villa’s entire playing squad and staff huddled together, awaiting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/26/arsenal-watford-premier-league-match-report">news from the Emirates Stadium</a>. Suddenly, the huddle exploded.</p><p>Yes: when the smoke had finally cleared from the longest Premier League season of them all, it was Villa who were still standing.

<p>Some of Watford’s players sank to their knees; others made for the tunnel without a moment’s delay. The whistle had just blown on their five years in the Premier League and nobody could say that, when the occasion demanded they hurl the kitchen sink at Arsenal, they did not go down without a fight. Their caretaker manager, Hayden Mullins, cajoled an insistent performance from his players but it was not enough despite a string of opportunities coming and going throughout. In the end they paid the price for seeing the game slip beyond them in the first period, when below-par opponents scored three times, and the consequences will be severe.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jul/26/premier-league-final-day-clockwatch-live">Premier League clockwatch: Aston Villa survive at expense of Bournemouth!</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/26/arsenal-watford-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Plus <strong>Bruce White</strong> on Boris Johnson’s reference to asymptomatic transmission</p><p>Sonia Sodha (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/23/bias-science-bse-coronavirus-crisis" title="">Bias in ‘the science’ on coronavirus? Britain has been here before</a>, 23 Juy) provides a welcome reminder of the BSE crisis and government science advisers “confusing a lack of evidence of risk or benefit for a lack of risk or benefit”. However, scientists are not the only people who assess risk. People make risk assessments every day, and the Covid-19 crisis has shown how people do this. Risk assessments are socially constructed and these different assessments need to be considered in public policymaking. For instance, where were any representatives of older people or people with disabilities when the decision was made to send a text asking them to stay indoors for three months?</p><p>This crisis will be characterised by the absence of public health expertise, but a second defining feature will be the lack of public input into policy decisions affecting millions of people. Scientific experts must not only be able to explain the strengths and weaknesses of evidence, but must also debate the implications of the evidence, with the public coming to a consensus. Democratic expertise is needed, rather than leaving experts to solve these problems alone.<br /><strong>Dr Jane Lethbridge</strong><br /><em>University of Greenwich</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/covid-19-trust-the-public-on-scientific-uncertainty">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It would be tempting to regard this president as an anomaly, but he has shown that white supremacy is always waiting in the wings</p><p>If Donald Trump loses in November – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/17/trump-biden-win-democrat-landslide">and it’s a very big if</a>, of course – then under Joe Biden, it will be hard for the United States not to be seduced into collective amnesia. The Trump presidency has represented such a thorough subversion of political norms that, with a Biden victory, the temptation to move on from it as swiftly as possible will be strong.</p><p>Already the signs are beginning to appear. The polls look encouraging for the Democrats, coronavirus is ravaging the country and Trump is unravelling a little more every day as he tries, and fails, to prove that he is “cognitively there” in TV interviews. The temptation is to indulge in a sort of fast-forwarding to the future, where Trump is a blip, the first and last of his kind.

<p>Widespread illegal dumping during lockdown prompts outrage among communities</p><p>The pile of abandoned tyres looms higher than a house and blocks the full width of the road in an industrial estate in Drumchapel, west of Glasgow city centre.

Founder of Fleetwood Mac and one of the guitar-playing greats of 1960s blues-rock<p>Peter Green, who has died aged 73, was one of the guitar-playing greats of 1960s blues-rock as well as a gifted songwriter. He was the founder of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/fleetwood-mac" title="">Fleetwood Mac</a> and although he was with the band for less than three years they became one of Britain’s leading acts during that time. Their singles of that period, including the Green compositions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRu7Pt42x6Y" title="">Black Magic Woman</a>, Albatross, Man of the World, Oh Well and The Green Manalishi, remain some of the most cherished releases of the era and the band was beginning to display major international potential by the time he quit in May 1970.</p><p>Then, apart from a burst of activity in the first half of the 80s, Green went missing from action until the late 90s as he struggled with psychological problems seemingly caused by his use of psychedelic drugs. Some considered him a guitarist superior even to such rock’n’roll deities as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/ericclapton" title="">Eric Clapton</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2014/oct/01/jimmy-page-from-cherubic-choirboy-to-rock-god-a-life-in-pictures" title="">Jimmy Page</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/26/peter-green-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

I had been dreaming of staring out at a raw, open horizon for years – ever since I found an old map of Scotland and pinned it up in the hallway in my London flat. It was positioned across the full length of a narrow wall where I always saw it as I was passing, at an angle where your eyes fell into that empty space between giant masses of land. It is always during that notion of transit, of passing from one space to another, that your heart opens and all of your dreaming begins. I would press my nose to that thick paper, inhaling its musty scent, as my finger traced the ragged coastline of the fractured islets and islands. In those moments, as my eyes closed, the traffic, shouts from the street, neighbours slamming doors, would evaporate into the hurl of fresh spindrift, the thick, curling crests of the breakers drenching the salt-stung air, the gulls tearing the skies apart with an aching, screaming call.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/26/i-ran-away-to-a-remote-scottish-island-it-was-perfect">Continue reading...</a>

Then, in early June, a neighbour started harassing them.</p><p>“It began quite lightly, with him being provocative whenever we met in the street,” the 38-year-old said. “Then he came to our home and forced his way in, calling us ‘dirty faggots’. My boyfriend managed to get rid of him but he returned with a baton and threw himself against the door, repeating the same insults and threatening to set us alight when we were asleep.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/26/italy-lgbt-new-law-debate">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A break with bubble mates leads to a fight over toys. Thank goodness for a noisy lion</p><p>Last week, with the easing of restrictions, we took a break to Essex with friends and bubble mates, Mary, Neave and their son Manu. I never ‘holidayed with friends’ growing up because our 13-seater minibus was usually at maximum occupancy, and few families professed any desire to accompany our rabble to a second location. So it felt adult and sophisticated to go away on a relaxing family trip with pals; the sort of thing rich English people do in sumptuous midcentury dramas.</p><p>Our trip reached new heights of relaxation when our son refused – for the 1,000th time that day – to share his trucks with Manu, causing them both to clatter to the ground like spilled pennies. Our boy arose, bawling, with a welt on his head the size, shape and colour of an uncooked Ikea meatball. This slowly filled the gap between his temple and left ear, and started bleeding. We immediately jumped in the car and sped to the nearest hospital, a 30-minute drive away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/26/seamus-oreilly-a-painful-row-over-toy-trucks-leads-to-a-trip-to-a-and-e">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Manic Street Preacher on protest music, Wales’s response to Covid-19 and why you party with ballet dancers at your peril</p><p>James Dean Bradfield was born in 1969, and brought up in the south Wales valleys. He formed the Manic Street Preachers at school in 1986 with friends Nicky Wire, Sean Moore and Richey Edwards; after Edwards went missing in 1995, the trio carried on, achieving both critical and commercial success. Next month, Bradfield releases his second solo LP, <em>Even </em><em>in Exile</em>, with lyrics written by the Welsh poet <a href="http://www.patrick-jones.info/">Patrick Jones</a>.</p><p><strong>How has lockdown been for you?<br /></strong>I didn’t leave my corner of Cardiff for months, or see my dad every week, as I always do, so that was hard. He’s 77, and still working as a gravedigger. I’ve also got young kids, eight and four, so I’ve been like the headmaster patrolling the corridors at home. I’ve also been running a lot while listening to music: lots of the Bad Plus, Public Enemy, George Benson, Rush, old C86 compilations. Blondie are amazing to exercise to.

Miles of asphalt without a single vehicle to spoil the view. Parked cars gathered dust, multi-storeys were deserted and garages shuttered. As lockdown eased, cars started to fill our streets again. But the great hiatus provided a glimpse into an alternative future.</p><p>Some cities, such as Milan, have already stated that they want to make permanent the changes brought about by the pandemic, and there have been calls across Britain for more space for walking and cycling. The warning lights signalling the end of the car’s total dominance over the way we travel and the way we plan cities are now flashing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/26/driving-may-never-be-the-same-again-after-coronavirus-but-what-a-ride-its-been">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Vinca Petersen’s shot of a fellow raver celebrates the freedom of the sound-system years</p><p>Vinca Petersen took this picture of her friend Paula as the sun came up after an all-night rave in Italy in 1997. By then Petersen had been on the road for four years with some of the “sound-system tribes” who had taken their free party culture across Europe after the 1994 Criminal Justice bill had outlawed raves in the UK. The picture comes from a reissue of Petersen’s book <em><a href="https://vincapetersen.com/no-system-the-book/">No System</a>,</em> which is her insider’s view of that hedonistic, nomadic life in the years leading up to the millennium.<br /><br />Petersen gave up her life on the road in 2004, when her son was born. In some senses those photographs look like historical documents to her now, but she still feels their familiarity and excitement. “When you live that sort of life, as I did for the whole of my 20s, there is a mentality you are left with,” she says. She called that mentality, in a recent exhibition, A Life of Subversive Joy, and sees her pictures as part of the family album of that universal possibility.</p><p>Her images often celebrated these private moments of connection, with people and with nature. “The highs were much more a consistent feeling of freedom than any sort of peak moments,” she says. “Obviously it is fantastic being in a huge crowd dancing the night away, but for me it was the whole life, whether it was parking up around the lake or turning up in a new city and meeting other like-minded people.” She could still probably arrive in any city in Europe and find someone to stay with who was part of that time, she says, “but I do rather like a nice comfy bed these days”. Paula is back settled and working in the UK now too. Petersen likes the idea that in the picture the night before is still going on. “It’s sunrise,” she says, “but it’s not a new day.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/26/the-big-picture-a-pre-millennium-party-animal">Continue reading...</a>

For a few years he cooked at the Criterion, when Marco Pierre White had the lease on London’s most outrageous room, and used it to make chicken kiev sexy. Afterwards he went to Paris to cook at another landmark, Le Jules Verne, perched on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower, where it could look down on all the other restaurants. Superstar chef Alain Ducasse was in charge then and he liked to dispatch his brigades off on stints at his other outposts. Huddleston went to the Michelin three-star Louis XV in Monaco, where the dining room groans with pendulous chandeliers and the glint and shimmer of the Mediterranean is part of the deal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/26/waterside-bistro-shipley-a-much-missed-old-friend-jay-rayner-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>
