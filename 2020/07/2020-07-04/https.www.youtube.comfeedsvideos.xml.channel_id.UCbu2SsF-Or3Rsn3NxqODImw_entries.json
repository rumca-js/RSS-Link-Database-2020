The premise is that this game takes place in a world where vinyl toys come to life and have their own lives when humans aren't looking. \n\nAs part of GameSpot's gaming celebration Play For All, we caught up with Mythical Games chief creative officer Jamie Jackson who told us all about this imaginative project. In the video, Jackson talks about numerous aspects of the game, including its robust-looking level-editor that allows players to create basically anything they can imagine. \n\nBasically, Blankos Block Party seems to combine the free-flowing gameplay of titles like Fortnite and Roblox with the aesthetic charm of a Funko Pop vinyl toy come to life. A beta test for the game launches later this year, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSOOniJ2FPs", "date_published": "2020-07-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5: 30 Video Game Series We Want To See On The New Console", "description": "For the past 26 years, the PlayStation has produced some of gamings most memorable titles.

But if you want to see what it's like on the hardest difficulty with absolutely no HUD, Jake has you covered.\n\nThe Last of Us Part 2 imagines a brutal world filled with zombie-like infected monsters, along with some just-as-deadly and just-as-monstrous surviving humans. It's a world where staying alive often means someone else has to die, and the resources you need to keep yourself alive and take down your enemies are always at a premium.\n\nBut if you really want to make The Last of Us 2 feel truly frightening, you should mess with its many elaborate difficulty settings. Developer Naughty Dog has included a lot of granular controls that let you create exactly the post-apocalyptic survival experience you want. And if you want a particularly intense, difficult experience, you can create one--so we set about trying to create the most authentic and harrowing version of The Last of Us Part 2 that we could. Check out the video above to see how we created the most difficult and realistic version of The Last of Us 2 we could manage.\n\nThe easiest way to increase the toughness of your playthrough of The Last of Us 2 is to ratchet it up to Survivor difficulty, but it's possible to make a lot of smaller, more specific changes as well--like turning off ammo indicators, reticles, and other HUD elements, or adjusting enemy intelligence. There are a variety of options that can make the game harder (or easier, or more comfortable), and it's totally worth messing with all of them to find your perfect playthrough.\n\nWe've got lots more coverage of The Last of Us Part 2, from our spoiler-free review (and spoiler review) to an explainer about the ending and tons of guides for finding everything the game has to offer.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM6h-Iu-87E", "date_published": "2020-07-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Your Cyberpunk 2077 Questions Answered", "description": "Jake and Tamoor played eight hours of Cyberpunk 2077 and are here to answer your questions!\n\nGameSpot recently had an opportunity to play a chunk of CD Projekt Red's much-anticipated RPG Cyberpunk 2077, which is shaping up to be one of this year's biggest games for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. \n\nYou had questions about the game, and we have answers.
