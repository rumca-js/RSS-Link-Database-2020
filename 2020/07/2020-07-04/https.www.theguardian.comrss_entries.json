Another inspiration was the murder of Clarissa Jean-Philippe, a young police officer from Martinique, who was killed by Amedy Coulibaly, a terrorist from Mali, during the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. I was upset because a black man could kill a black woman and so C\u00e9saire\u2019s theory of n\u00e9gritude, which claimed that all black people are brothers and sisters, therefore, no longer had any meaning.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/04/maryse-conde-an-english-author-can-reach-the-heart-of-a-caribbean-child\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/04/maryse-conde-an-english-author-can-reach-the-heart-of-a-caribbean-child", "date_published": "2020-07-04 17:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Boris Johnson gets Britain building again \u2013\u00a0cartoon", "description": "<p>Chris Riddell on the prime minister\u2019s plan to tear up planning regulations</p><p>\u2022<a href=\"https://guardianprintshop.com/collections/chris-riddell-1/products/5th-july-2020\">You can buy your own print of this cartoon</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/jul/04/boris-johnson-gets-britain-building-again-cartoon\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2020/jul/04/boris-johnson-gets-britain-building-again-cartoon", "date_published": "2020-07-04 17:00:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "England's pubs reopen as lockdown eases \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, cinemas and theme parks reopen, and weddings and baptisms take place as lockdown rules relaxed</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/jul/04/englands-first-taste-of-freedom-in-pictures\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/jul/04/englands-first-taste-of-freedom-in-pictures", "date_published": "2020-07-04 16:48:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Lewis Hamilton unhappy with some F1 drivers' 'complicit silence' on racism", "description": "<ul><li>Briton says \u2018some don\u2019t understand what is happening\u2019</li><li>World champion Hamilton beaten to pole by teammate Bottas</li></ul><p>Qualifying had a familiar air as Formula One got back on track for the opening race of the delayed season at the Austrian Grand Prix.

And that\u2019s not true. Every time you go on to the intensive care unit you get a visual reminder of why it\u2019s not, because of the amount of equipment that you have to put on to just go and simply say hello to a patient.<br /><br />Seeing <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-they-call-it-the-apocalypse-inside-italys-hardest-hit-hospital-11960597\">the images from Italy</a> had been terrifying. We were all wrestling our own demons, organising our personal affairs, getting wills done that we\u2019d put off for years. When the worst of it hit it was really hard watching the team cope with the rush of reality. I think the new additions to the team that we had built were hit the hardest. People dying in intensive care is not new, but dying without family and friends around them is very unusual. This was a another new normal to adjust to; phoning family to tell them their loved one was dying, or dead, but they could not see them.<br /><br />At the same time, there was something uplifting.<br /><br />Everyone had a kind of common focus and a common goal \u2013 normally everyone just gets on with doing their own thing \u2013 but we had large teams of people working together with the one focus. There were so many people. Everything was masks and sweatiness. When people took their gear off they had deep marks around their faces and that kind of matted look to their hair.<br /><br />We\u2019re still admitting patients with Covid-19 although obviously not as many as at the peak. We are currently getting about 200 patients a day coming in through A&amp;E. About half of them have symptoms that are related to Covid, so they\u2019re sent to the Covid side where they can be assessed and treated. All the medical staff are fully equipped with PPE because we\u2019re anticipating that the patient has Covid until the tests prove they don\u2019t.<br /><br />It slows everything down. Everything has changed. I get a bun on my way to work \u2013 it\u2019s my Friday treat. When you go in, you\u2019ve got to put alcohol gel on your hands, so that\u2019s the end of the bun. To walk through the hospital you have to put a mask on. Nobody lingers in the corridors any more. When you go into the ICU, there\u2019s more PPE \u2013 a new mask first and more alcohol gel. Going to see a patient in a side room you\u2019re getting on a plastic apron with arms, two pairs of gloves, a different face mask, face shield.<br /><br />At the peak, we made space for about 300 Covid beds on our two sites. Now we\u2019re back down to our normal 100 or so.</p><p>The real difficulty now is that we know full well there\u2019s a bunch of patients out there who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/11/cancer-patients-missed-out-on-tests-during-uk-coronavirus-lockdown\">need management of their underlying conditions,</a> such as operations or transplants. We\u2019ve been working towards starting that up again but it\u2019s difficult. It\u2019s not a tap you can turn off and on.<br /><br />If someone has been waiting years for a kidney transplant, and an organ became available, how would we get them into hospital in a safe way? We can\u2019t ask them to self-isolate for two weeks \u2013 that\u2019s not how organs appear. We\u2019ve been trying to set up a system to make sure the transplant recipient is safe, because they\u2019re immuno-suppressed.<br /><br />That\u2019s why I\u2019ve been worried about <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-they-call-it-the-apocalypse-inside-italys-hardest-hit-hospital-11960597\">ending the lockdown,</a> and people going back to how things were six months ago. That needs to be pushed back against, we can\u2019t go back.<br /><br />We\u2019ve been preparing for this weekend as if it\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve. We\u2019ve discharged as many people as we can. We\u2019ve had to bulk up the daytime shifts, the evening shifts and the night shifts.
