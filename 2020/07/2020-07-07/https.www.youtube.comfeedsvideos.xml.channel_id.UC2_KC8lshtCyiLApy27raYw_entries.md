Whats up gamers its me boogie2988 coming at you live with another slap daddy hit. You know what this video is about. Nothing. None of these videos are about anything
Anyway, figured I’d talk about E3 again cause, ya know, it aint around no more. So here’s, uh, the video. Does anybody actually read these? I mean I don’t, just wondering if you do.
