<p>Independent inquiry to examine ‘shocking’ claims of physical and emotional abuse</p><p>British Gymnastics has announced an independent inquiry into “shocking and upsetting” allegations of serious physical and emotional abuse made by multiple elite athletes, including fresh claims of fat-shaming by one London 2012 Olympian.<br /><br />Francesca Fox, who competed as a rhythmic gymnast at the London 2012 Games, told ITV on Tuesday night that she was constantly told she was “fat” and “looked like a hippo” and ended up weighing herself up to 10 times a day as a result.<br /><br />Her comments came a day after another former British Olympian, the gymnast Lisa Mason, said she had been made to train until her hands ripped and bled. “My hands would then be pulled down and surgical spirit would be poured all over them,” she added. “I would also have AstroTurf put under the bars so I would burn my feet if I didn’t keep them up. But everyone else is going through it, so you think it’s normal.”<br /><br />A third leading gymnast has claimed that she was locked in a cupboard by her coach as a 10-year-old. The gymnasts who spoke out have been given strong support by those within the sport. Becky Downie, a 2019 world championship silver medallist on the uneven bars, tweeted: </p><p dir="ltr" lang="en">It’s more important to protect the future generations right now. <br />Don’t get me wrong this sport is HARD &amp; there is a lot of bad stuff you kind of just have to deal with to make it to the top BUT .... <br />THERE IS A LINE &amp; that line has been crossed way too many times !! <a href="https://t.co/GM2ftSPjSm">https://t.co/GM2ftSPjSm</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/07/uk-sport-to-investigate-shocking-and-upsetting-claims-of-gymnastics-abuse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US president’s tactic of using religion as a battering ram in his culture wars may not work a second time </p><p>Donald Trump has suggested that the Bible is his favourite book. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/religion/2020/02/14/trump-mocks-faith-others-his-own-religious-practices-remain-opaque/" title="">When pressed</a> to say more, he has shiftily declined to name a single chapter or verse. But for those curious to understand Mr Trump’s current religious preoccupations, his Twitter feed is offering regular enlightenment in the lead-up to November’s presidential elections.</p><p>Last week, Mr Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1278825777052729345" title="">approvingly tweeted</a> the words of a bestselling Catholic author who claimed on late-night television that American Christianity was under attack as protesters roamed the streets. The writer, Dr Taylor Marshall, moves in similar arch-conservative religious circles to another Trump favourite, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, the former papal nuncio to the United States. Last month Archbishop Viganò <a href="https://www.thetablet.co.uk/news/13042/trump-honoured-by-vigan-letter" title="">published an open letter</a> to Mr Trump in which he claimed that the Black Lives Matter protests that followed the death of George Floyd were orchestrated by “deep state” operatives. Describing the protests as part of an assault on the values of western Christian civilisation, the archbishop praised the president for robustly opposing “the children of darkness” who were threatening the social fabric. Mr Trump tweeted that he was honoured by the archbishop’s letter and hoped “everyone, religious or not, reads it”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/07/the-guardian-view-on-trump-and-the-christian-vote-doubting-donald">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She put her mark on The Handmaid’s Tale. Now the British director is working on Mrs America, which stars Cate Blanchett as an infamous anti-feminist. But that’s not who’s caught Asante’s eye</p><p>It’s difficult for Amma Asante to assess how far she’s come, because she just doesn’t have the relevant role models. “I haven’t had the example,” says the director, “of someone who is both black, British and female to look to, in terms of the career I’d like to have. It’s thwarted my sense of expectation.”</p><p>Still, in the decade between making her first film, 2004’s Bafta-winning <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,,1348574,00.html">A Way of Life</a>, and her second, the 18th-century-set drama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jun/15/belle-review-costume-drama-teeth-slavery">Belle</a>, Asante became increasingly aware of male counterparts getting more chances, being more likely to be award-nominated, and consequently getting even more opportunities and even bigger budgets.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/07/chisholm-obama-director-amma-asante-mrs-america-handmaids-tale">Continue reading...</a>

The good news is that, whatever their age, broad beans always have a use.

Her favourites come from <a href="https://hodmedods.co.uk/">Hodmedods</a>, pioneer of UK-grown pulses, from quinoa to carlin peas, which she soaks, cooks and blends with herbs and olive or rapeseed oil. Cooked broads are reserved for tossing through salads and pasta, or for serving with grilled lamb.

<p>In her book Want, Strong hones in on these two themes – a life built on privilege but teetering on privation</p><p>In the last few years, Lynn Steger Strong has built a wide audience with her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/coronavirus-covid-19-pandemic-two-in-five?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other">compelling essays</a> – including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/two-in-five">a series</a> for the Guardian – about the precarity that can coexist with privilege in America, indictments of a country where getting an education or having a child or a long illness can in an instant turn a stable financial situation to an unstable one.</p><p>In Want, out this month, Strong homes in on those themes. In this novel, her second, narrator Elizabeth is raising two small children with her husband, a carpenter, in New York City, while going through a bankruptcy and teaching low-income students at a charter school and adjuncting at a prestigious university.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/07/lynn-steger-strong-book-want-precarity-privilege">Continue reading...</a>

They have long resistance bands, tied to a fence, and are executing a routine of gym classics: squats, lunges and pushups.</p><p>Before lockdown, Gary and Joe were your classic gymgoers: they went for the weights, not the classes, four times a week for at least an hour each time, Gary before work, Joe after.

<p>Michael Gove has set out his plans for a revolution of Britain’s permanent bureaucracy, the civil service. But as former Downing Street chief of staff Jonathan Powell argues, it is easier said than done</p><p>When <strong>Jonathan Powell </strong>arrived in Downing Street in 1997 as Tony Blair’s chief of staff, he was met with a handshake from the head of the civil service. From then on, it was this institution, comprising hundreds of thousands of apolitical government employees, that would be tasked with turning the new ideas into reality. </p><p>Powell tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that it was not easy: many officials are reluctant to run with new ideas, or tend to look for problems rather than solutions. It’s an issue that the current Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove, has also identified. In a recent speech, he promised to shake things up: move more civil servants out of London, make them take more risks, and become more specialist and numerate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jul/07/taking-on-sir-humphrey-can-the-civil-service-be-reformed-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
