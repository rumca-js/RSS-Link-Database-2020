It is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 (Clinical Infectious Disease, 6 July)

https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798

239 scientists support this Commentary 

Potential for airborne spread of COVID-19

Significant potential for inhalation exposure

Microscopic respiratory droplets (microdroplets)

Viruses are released during exhalation, talking, and coughing in microdroplets

Small enough to remain aloft in air

5 μm droplet will travel tens of meters

Transmission via airborne microdroplets is an important pathway

Hand washing and social distancing are appropriate, but insufficient

Viruses have been shown to survive equally well, if not better, in aerosols compared to droplets on a surface

Several superspreading events

We must address every potentially important pathway to slow the spread of COVID-19

Measures that should be taken

Provide sufficient and effective ventilation (supply clean outdoor air, minimize recirculating air) particularly in public buildings, workplace environments, schools, hospitals, and aged care homes. 

Supplement general ventilation with airborne infection controls such as local exhaust, high efficiency air filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet lights. 

Avoid overcrowding, particularly in public transport and public buildings. 

WHO response

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200326-sitrep-66-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=81b94e61_2

Transmission through smaller droplet nuclei (airborne transmission) that propagate through air at distances longer than 1 meter is limited to aerosol generating procedures during clinical care of COVID-19 patients. 

In all other contexts, available evidence indicates that COVID-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites.

WHO continues to recommend

Everyone performs hand hygiene frequently

Follows respiratory etiquette

Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces

Maintaining physical distances

Avoiding people with fever or respiratory symptoms

These preventive measures will limit viral transmission

WHO, However

We are also looking at the possible role of airborne transmission in other settings

We will be releasing our brief in the coming days

We acknowledge there is emerging evidence in this field

Therefore, we believe we have to be open to this evidence and its implications

Determining the dose of the virus required for airborne transmission

These fields of research are really growing but not definitive

The possibility of airborne transmission in public settings — especially closed, poorly ventilated settings — cannot be ruled out

Importance of removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation

The message has not been clear enough

Guidelines have been inconsistent.

Evidence that they protected other people was ‘clearer all the time’


‘Some evidence’ they protected the wearer

‘There are people without symptoms going about their daily business who are unknowingly breathing out droplets that are carrying the virus’

‘If they had their faces covered the majority of those droplets would be caught before they can infect other people 

Wearing face coverings can help save lives and prevent disabling illnesses’

Known and unknowns

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01315-7

First coronavirus, 10,000 to 300 million years ago

Seven strains infect humans

Four that cause common colds, 2 from rodents, 2 from bats

SARS-CoV, bats

MERS-CoV, bats

SARS-CoV-2, horseshoe bats

Usually an intermediary

SARS, civet cats, (abused in China)

MERS-CoV, Camels

SARS-CoV-2 Viral Origins

Shares 96% of its genetic material with a virus found in a bat in a cave in Yunnan, China

But this bat virus does not infect people

Spike proteins in SARS-CoV-2 is different and more efficient

The 4% difference = decades of evolution

Malayan pangolins, up to 92% of their genomes with the SARS-CoV-2 

Need an animal that hosts a version more than 99% similar to SARS-CoV-2
Chinese studies found no animal intermediates

https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01989-z?utm_source=Nature+Briefing&utm_campaign=59d57f54e5-briefing-dy-20200706&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_c9dfd39373-59d57f54e5-44762053

Why do people respond so differently?

Infection factors

Ten viral particles might be enough to get to the throat, but are likely to be cleared by mucociliary system

100 viral particles can get down to the lungs

Pneumonia of rapid onset

Two infection points combining the transmissibility of the common cold coronaviruses with the lethality of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV

Therefore SARS-CoV-2 can shed viral particles into saliva even before symptoms start

Host factors

Human gene variants that might explain some differences

4,000 people from Italy and Spain, respiratory failure, two particular gene variants

Tuberculosis and Epstein–Barr virus, single genes. 

Immunological response

How good and how long?

Neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2

IgM first 23 days

IgG up to 49 days

Longer after severe infection

?IgA

Memory T lymphocytes

Sterilizing immunity, may last for a few months

Protective immunity, much longer

Virus mutations

Mutations used to trace spread

More or less virulent or transmissible

Reinfection and vaccination
A mutation seems to have emerged around February in Europe

More infectious to cultured cells

Vaccination

200 in development worldwide

20 in clinical trials

Awaiting placebo controlled trials

Macaque monkeys suggest prevention of lung infection and pneumonia

Neutralizing antibodies generated

Vaccine could be improved over time
