could be asymptomatic and still give you the virus.\n\nNo, I don't \"live in fear\" of the virus; I just want to be part of the solution, not the problem.\n\nI don't feel like the \"government controls me\". I feel like I'm an adult contributing to security in our society and I want to teach others the same.\n\nIf we could all live with the consideration of others in mind, the whole world would be a much better place.\n\nWearing a mask doesn't make me weak, scared, stupid or even \"controlled\". It makes me caring.\n\nWhen you think about your appearance, discomfort, or other people's opinion of you, imagine a loved one - a child, father, mother, grandparent, aunt, uncle or even a stranger - placed on a ventilator, alone without you or any family member who is allowed at his bedside.\n\nAsk yourself if you could have helped them a little while wearing a mask.\n\nIf simply wearing a mask helps even half of all the anxious and worried people get back out there to live their lives, and strengthens our economy in the process, then I'm happy to make them feel more comfortable.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBdgAUA0VvA", "date_published": "2020-07-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
