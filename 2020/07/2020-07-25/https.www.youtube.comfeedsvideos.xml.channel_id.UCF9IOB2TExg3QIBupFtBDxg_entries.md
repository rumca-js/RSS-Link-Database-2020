Obesity

French study

BMI more than 35 compared with BMI less than 25 kg/m2

7 fold increased risk for mechanical ventilation 

New York study, (in under 60s)

BMI, 30 to 34, 1.8 times more likely to be admitted to CCU

BMI, more than 35, 3.6 times more likely to be admitted to CCU


Obesity

Calories on beer and wine

Britons will be encouraged to pay attention to 'hidden' calories in food and drink

Almost twice as many as in 1993

Protein, 4 calories per gram

Carbohydrates, 4 calories per gram

Fat, 9 calories per gram

Fibre, 2 calories per gram

Ethanol, 7 calories per gram

10 ml of ethanol = 8 grams of ethanol

200 mls of wine at 12 % = 24 mls of ethanol

Dr Deborah Brix (WHO response coordinator)

We have to change our behaviour now

Before this virus moves back up through the north

New outbreaks began in under 30-year olds

California

Arizona

Dr. Fauci

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/07/25/coronavirus-covid-updates/

States hit hard by the virus in recent weeks needed to halt or walk back their reopenings

A vaccine would likely not be “widely available” until “several months in” to 2021

US public interest research group

Need to stop taking half actions

Shut it down now (500 health experts to president) 

LA

No plans for additional shutdowns

CDC

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6930e1.htm

Relatively little is known about the clinical course of COVID-19 and return to baseline health for persons with milder, outpatient illness.

Multistate telephone survey of symptomatic adults who had a positive outpatient test

35% had not returned to their usual state of health 2–3 weeks after testing

Among 18–34 years with no chronic medical conditions, one in five had not returned to their usual state of health

Therefore

COVID-19 can result in prolonged illness, even among young adults without underlying chronic medical conditions. 

Effective public health messaging targeting these groups is warranted.

Executive order lowering drug prices

Test results

Should be 4 days but up to 2 weeks

Masks mandated
McDonalds
Aldi
Costco
Lowe’s
Publix

If you see me wearing a mask in public and in the shops, I want you to know that...

I'm educated enough to know that I could be asymptomatic and still give you the virus.

No, I don't "live in fear" of the virus; I just want to be part of the solution, not the problem.

I don't feel like the "government controls me". I feel like I'm an adult contributing to security in our society and I want to teach others the same.

If we could all live with the consideration of others in mind, the whole world would be a much better place.

Wearing a mask doesn't make me weak, scared, stupid or even "controlled". It makes me caring.

When you think about your appearance, discomfort, or other people's opinion of you, imagine a loved one - a child, father, mother, grandparent, aunt, uncle or even a stranger - placed on a ventilator, alone without you or any family member who is allowed at his bedside.

Ask yourself if you could have helped them a little while wearing a mask.

If simply wearing a mask helps even half of all the anxious and worried people get back out there to live their lives, and strengthens our economy in the process, then I'm happy to make them feel more comfortable.
