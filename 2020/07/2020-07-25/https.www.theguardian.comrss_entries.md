It was almost a mirror image of the 1980s when Clive Lloyd had to decide whether to start with Mikey, Malcolm or Joel while his opposite number was having to desperately shuffle a makeshift attack. Joe Root’s quartet does not possess the same searing pace Lloyd had at his disposal, but it bristles with quality and energy.</p><p>A first-innings total of 369 may have been a mild disappointment given England’s starting point but it was enough to boss the game as the pacemen turned the screw. Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson were miserly, on target and keen to justify possession of the new ball; their sidekicks, Jofra Archer and Chris Woakes, were a little more expensive but always dangerous.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/25/england-dominate-west-indies-after-stuart-broads-assault">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Yes, some of the royal couple’s behaviour has been cringe-worthy, but the racism directed at the duchess was all too real</p><p>Are you for or against <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/meghan-duchess-of-sussex">Meghan Markle</a>? Are the couple wholly wronged and wonderful, no caveats permitted? Or is she an ambitious, wily, showbiz witch who hypnotised her prince into abandoning his family so that she could swan about the globe as a semi-royal, with all the privileges, but fewer tedious ribbon-snipping responsibilities? Perhaps most pressingly in this increasingly polarised issue, does the shabby treatment of Meghan in any way affect your view?</p><p>Even for someone as staunchly Team Markle as myself, the new biography of the couple, <em>Finding Freedom</em>, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand (with insights from friends of the couple, perhaps even secretly the couple themselves), looks a tad too simpatico. In the extracts I’ve seen, Meghan is depicted “tearfully” saying to a friend: “I gave up my entire life for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes”, which could be true, but it’s also a highly convenient pull-quote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/25/im-not-blind-to-meghan-markles-flaws-but-shes-been-treated-abominably">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prize-winning young writer on the politics of restaurants, diversity in his home town of Houston, and why coming out is a constant process</p><p><a href="https://brywashing.com/">Bryan Washington</a>’s 2019 debut short story collection, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/aug/07/lot-bryan-washington-review-tough-tender-houston-short-stories">Lot</a></em>, was winner of the Dylan Thomas prize and listed as one of Barack Obama’s <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-12-28/barack-obama-favorite-books-2019">favourite </a><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-12-28/barack-obama-favorite-books-2019">books of the </a><a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2019-12-28/barack-obama-favorite-books-2019">year</a>. Set in impoverished Houston neighbourhoods, where gentrification threatens a collection of fierce and feisty characters – minimum-wage kitchen staff, drug dealers, sex workers – it is often darkly funny. At the book’s centre is Nicholas, the recurring narrator, who wrestles with his queerness and black-Latino identity. Washington, 27, has written for the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>New Yorker</em> and <em>Paris Review</em>. <em>Lot </em>is out in paperback on 6 August; his first novel, <em>Memorial</em>, follows early next year in the UK.</p><p><strong>In </strong><em><strong>Lot</strong></em><strong> individual chapters represent different marginalised regions of Houston, your home town…<br /></strong>The city, for me, has no focal point. Houston is not inundated with “third” places; you go to work and then you go home and then you have the sprawl in between. There are landmarks that I would acknowledge that could be immediately invalidated by my neighbours and none of us would be wrong. It’s largely due to the diversity of the city; not just the ethnic diversity but also diversity of thought, economy and religion. Its residents have had to come together to find ways of functioning on a daily basis – not seamlessly, but what’s really cool about living here is the way that it’s understood you can live multiple lives simultaneously.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/25/bryan-washington-my-next-book-is-a-gay-slacker-dramedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mixing it with the French, I am converted to a deliciously chic tonic water</p><p>Until we boarded the plane, I didn’t believe we’d ever make it to France for a long-planned stay with friends. But we did, and here we are, and everything is at once the same and yet strangely changed. Bouncing across the sound from the mainland to the island of Porquerolles, I was startled out of a soaring sense of happiness by the sight of an open-top ferry on which every passenger was wearing a mask. Normally, I’m the kind of goof who waves at people on boats, but an invisible hand stopped me this time.</p><p>I don’t believe travel broadens the mind (I’ve met too many expats), but I do relish the small discoveries you sometimes make while away. My find this year is an environmentally sound French tonic water called (brilliantly) <a href="https://www.archibaldtonic.com/">Archibald</a>, whose delicious bitterness is derived from gentian, not quinine, and which comes in an ineffably chic little bottle emblazoned with a French tricolour. When I get home, my dastardly plan is that – <em>mais oui! </em>– Archibald will replace Schweppes as my mixer of choice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/25/bitter-discovery-simply-adds-to-the-holiday-feeling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Despite a dismal run of form caused by injuries and rivals countering Jamie Vardy, reaching Europe signals a triumphant season, even if they miss out on the Champions League</p><p>It is the age of data and yet it is also the age of impatience. It is an age when Match of the Day provides the xG and yet a manager can come under pressure after three defeats. It is the age when most people understand the phrase “regression to the mean”, yet it is also an age when mayflies have begun using “Watford head coach” to denote something with a short lifespan.

<p>Preparing food helped me reconcile my old and new world. Now my restaurant produces a beautiful mongrel cuisine</p><p>‘Now you better behave and don’t cry!” was the warning from my mother, shot with a stern look to show she was deadly serious. We disembarked from the aircraft at Heathrow. It was a dark and dank day. Cold rain spat at us as we walked across the tarmac into the immigration hall. In the terminal, the world seemed full of strangers and I swallowed back my tears.</p><p>The sunless flat above a shop that my father had found for us was full of draughts and damp. At the makeshift kitchen table, I stared at the exposed electrical wires knotted together on the wall and pined for the warmth of the neat, beloved grandmother we had left behind in our haste to leave Kenya. England welcomed immigrants, but its housing did not. Back home, when you opened the door, every room was fragrant with the scent of ripening guavas. Here, there was just a solitary freckled apple in the fruit bowl that, like us, had seen better days.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/25/cooking-eased-my-exile-and-became-my-homage-to-immigrants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 10-year-old’s lockdown project could just spearhead a new generation of music mags</p><p>I started packing to move house last week, for the umpteenth time, and ended up going through an old pound shop laundry bag filled with those mystery bits and bobs that just seem to gather. Combing through it, I felt more morose than usual, not just because moving house is so horrible but because I kept coming across the detritus of my days as a music journalist: gig fliers, posters ripped from long-dead venue walls, magazines I’d once hoarded and then been lucky enough to write for. They felt like relics of a different time. They were, I suppose. Most of the magazines were gone or going.</p><p>Last week, <em>Q</em> became one of the gone, another casualty of the pandemic, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/q-magazine-to-fold-after-34-years">ceasing publication after 34 years</a>. I can’t pretend to be impartial about the news, because I wrote for it, and the announcement has left me with a sad, sinking feeling. It was a place where in-depth features about the usual artists, and the unusual ones, still had a home and I loved writing for it. The last piece I did was about an Australian busker who’d gone from living in her van to <em>The Ellen DeGeneres Show</em> in the space of a year. Her story was a proper story, not necessarily big-namey, but deserving of the space it was given.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/25/arlo-lippiatts-pint-sized-punk-brings-hope-to-bereft-q-readers">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A small-town Texas choir director takes over a California drag joint, with mixed results<br /></p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/24/jacki-weaver-michael-powell-said-i-was-headed-for-great-things-he-didnt-tell-me-it-would-take-50-years">Jacki Weaver</a>’s Maybelline Metcalf is a tough Texan mama bear and director of her small-town church choir, a fine fit for the Australian actor’s natural matriarchal authority. “I don’t storm, I flounce,” Maybelline says. Her maternal instincts come to the fore when her estranged gay son dies suddenly and she ends up inheriting his failing San Francisco drag joint, taking his gang of misfit colleagues and friends under her wing.</p><p>Her waifs and strays include single mother Sienna (Lucy Lui), lip syncing drag queens Cherry Poppins (<em>Tangerine</em>’s Mya Taylor), Joan of Arkansas (Allister MacDonald) and Tequila Mockingbird (Oscar Moreno), who she coaxes into using their real voices, and her late son’s sceptical boyfriend (a bizarrely cast Adrian Grenier), who she wins over with her plans to revive the club. A further demonstration of “solidarity” sees her wearing a slash of glitter lipgloss and belting out Bonnie Tyler’s Total Eclipse of the Heart. Queer Canadian film-maker Thom Fitzgerald cheerfully attempts to bridge the gap between two disparate communities, but Maybelline’s swift acceptance of and affection towards her son’s chosen family suggests she didn’t have far to go in the first place. The feelgood tone feels a little flaccid. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/25/stage-mother-review-jacki-weaver-feelgood-drag-film-falls-flat">Continue reading...</a>

Everybody said their names and what they meant. It was powerful. The names are always deeply connected to something. There’s a name I mentioned in a film once, Obianuju. It means “to come into a place where there is plenty”. There’s something so beautiful, poetic and hopeful about parents naming their child that.</p><p><strong>Lockdown has been</strong> intense. It has created all these primary emotions where you are concerned about loved ones. You’re involved in the day-to-day lives of friends and family, because you have more time to connect and understand. Usually you’re in so much of a rush that you just get the highlights. But in this period, I’ve been able to get the lowlights.

When he meets up with the beautiful Maggie, he’s persuaded into going far off the beaten track until they run into some locals, out “huntin’ pigs”, who bring them back to their isolated small town for a few nights.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/25/gabriel-bergmoser-there-is-a-brand-of-country-australian-masculinity-that-is-particularly-threatening">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A quick, store-cupboard take on Egypt’s classic ful medames</p><p>There was once a place called Gaby’s Deli on Charing Cross Road in central London. It was a cheap and friendly place frequented by everyone from students to Charlie Chaplin and actors from nearby theatreland, and it’s also where I first ate <em>ful medames</em>, the dish on which today’s recipe is based – traditionally, it’s a thick stew of broad beans spiced with cumin and garlic and brightened with lemon and herbs, and they’re the sort of beans that would make you feel at home anywhere. Sadly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/21/landmark-jewish-cafe-gabys-deli-in-london-to-close">Gab</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/oct/21/landmark-jewish-cafe-gabys-deli-in-london-to-close">y’s has since closed</a> and dried fava beans are hard to come by, so here’s a quicker version using tinned borlotti. It’s not quite the same (both the dish and without Gaby’s), but it is just as homely.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/25/meera-sodha-vegan-recipe-crushed-borlotti-beans-chopped-salad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Summery greens for all ages: beans braised with tomato and garlic, broad beans and herb salad doused in garlicky sauce, and Mediterranean-style chard with tomatoes and olives</p><p>Going by my experiences with young ones, I am not entirely sure that the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zrRlMGeBes">Popeye and spinach campaign</a> was strictly necessary. Yes, green vegetables weren’t my children’s first dinner choice when they were very young, but, as they get older, they take much less encouragement at least to try them.</p><p>The thing about green food is, it tells you where it’s going to take you, depending on where it lands on the colour spectrum: deeper shades mean it’s likely to be complex and earthy, while lighter ones tend to be more vibrant and fresh. Kids get that, so they often start with peas, broad beans or courgettes, before venturing on to the darker leaves and peppery herbs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/25/yotam-ottolenghi-recipes-for-summery-green-side-dishes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>On 1 March, photographer Jon Tonks left New Zealand on a Pacific cruise. Twenty eight days later, the boat docked in San Diego, amid a pandemic. What happened in between?</p><p>The cruise ship<a href="https://www.hollandamerica.com/en_US/cruise-ships/ms-maasdam/4.html" title=""> MS Maasdam</a> left New Zealand on the evening of 1 March, steaming out of Auckland’s Waitemata harbour into the Hauraki Gulf, where it headed north. The route was to San Diego via Fiji, the Cook Islands, French Polynesia and Hawaii. On board the Holland America Line ship were around 1,200 passengers, including Americans, Britons, Canadians, Australians and French holidaymakers. The 542 crew included Dutch, Americans, Germans, Venezuelans and Filipinos. There were also a handful of entertainers and guest lecturers along for the ride, including Jon Tonks, a portrait photographer from Bath, who ended up with a portrait of a cruise that didn’t go to plan.</p><p>Covid-19 was certainly a thing at the beginning of March, but it was still considered mainly a China thing. The Maasdam wouldn’t be going anywhere near China. Questionnaires were handed to passengers, about symptoms and where they’d been before, but then they were good to go. Still, Tonks says that friends had joked before he left: “Good luck on your corona cruise.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/25/luckiest-people-in-the-world-month-on-last-lockdown-cruise">Continue reading...</a>

But after he retired to Antigua, the country of his birth, in 1995, the UK government froze his state pension entitlement. Since then, he may have missed out on more than £30,000.</p><p>Monica Philip has a similar story. Now aged 81, she spent 37 years working in the UK before moving back to Antigua to nurse her ailing mother.
