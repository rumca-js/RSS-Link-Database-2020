The release of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla is coming up in just a few short months, introducing you to the world of Vikings and putting you into the boots of protagonist Eivor. But who is this legendary warrior and what can we expect from their journey?

In a new video, Jess covers seven big things we learned about Eivor. The video touches on Eivor’s history as a leader from Norway who hopes to settle Anglo-Saxon England. The video includes quotes from Valhalla’s writer, Darby McDevitt, who shared new details on Eivor’s personality.

Also in the video, Jess talks about Eivor’s unique combat style--which is much more brutal and aggressive than that of Kassandra or Alexios from AC: Odyssey. We also learn more about Eivor’s romantic opportunities, the mystery of Eivor’s flexible DNA, and Eivor’s deadly ambition.

## The Evolution Of Halo's Gameplay

With the latest Halo Infinite reveal, it’s the perfect time to look at the evolution of Halo’s gameplay and how it’s gradually evolved across all of the mainline games. 

With Xbox finally showing off gameplay for Halo Infinite, the sixth mainline entry in the popular first-person shooter franchise, we figured it would be the perfect time to go back and chart the series' evolution. From 2001's Halo: Combat Evolved to 2020's Halo Infinite, the franchise has seen quite a few changes over the years.

In the video above, Persia details those changes over the course of Halo's six mainline entries, throwing in a few words for the franchise's notable spin-offs, Halo 3: ODST and Halo Reach. Some of the changes have been narrative driven--Halo 2, for example, introduced a new playable character in the Arbiter. However, some changes were more gameplay-focused, like Halo 3's introduction of split screen co-op in the main campaign.

Halo hasn't merely changed on the campaign side either--it's multiplayer has seen numerous overhauls over the course of the franchise's history. Halo 3: ODST, for instance, introduced a brand-new horde mode called Firefight and dropped dual-wielding altogether. But there have been more transformative changes as well, the most notable of which has to be Forge mode. Not only did Forge mode open up the floor for the community to create its own maps, the addition led to the creation of game types that were so popular that developers Bungie and 343 Industries would go on to recognize them as permanent game modes, like Grifball. 

If you're looking to catch up on Halo's story prior to the Holiday 2020 release of Halo Infinite, then your best bet is picking up Halo: The Master Chief Collection. The collection contains Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo Reach, and Halo 4. Other than Halo 5: Guardians, that's every game that Persia talks about in the video above.

Here are 5 Call Of Duty moments brought to you by the Warzone community. 

Call of Duty: Warzone is full of awesome, hilarious, and big-brain moments- sometimes all at once. This is our roundup of the top 5 Call of Duty: Warzone Moments of the week. 

In our first clip, Reddit user KuzushiKavanagh makes a seemingly impossible save. After his friend FeedtheP0ny is downed on top of stadium, the only way he can pick his friend up is by letting him fall down. FeedtheP0ny plummets down to his friend in this hilarious mid-air revive. 
In our second clip, Reddit user Releasethesnacken finds himself surrounded by an entire enemy squad...only they don’t even know it. He’s able to hide behind three other enemies on the back of a pickup truck and go entirely unnoticed. That is until he wipes them all out using his R9-0 shotgun.

Clip number 3 features Twitter user Fhoowd in quite the pickle. Surrounded by two riot-shielding enemies, Fhoowd attempts to take them head-on. Unfortunately, the two enemies aren’t letting up and are making their way closer for the kill. Low on ammo, Fhoowd thinks quickly and drops his ammunitions box, which when fired at can be used much like a claymore explosive. As the shielders move in for the kill, Fhoowd drops the box and fires on it, killing both enemies at once. This incredibly risky move proved worthwhile for Fhoowd as he takes a few seconds for a victory tea-bagging.  

Clip 4 is a terrifying look at what a glitchy operator skin can look like. If you want to pick up the Earth Expeditionary Force pack you’ve been warned. To round off our list, clip 5 comes from a Playstation Network user by the name of Pete_392. Pete is separated from his team when he comes across two enemies within inches of his position. Luckily, with the help of his riot shield, he’s able to go unnoticed in a corner for nearly a minute. Shocking still is that he manages to stealthily take down both enemies as they still have no idea he’s even in the same building as he is.
