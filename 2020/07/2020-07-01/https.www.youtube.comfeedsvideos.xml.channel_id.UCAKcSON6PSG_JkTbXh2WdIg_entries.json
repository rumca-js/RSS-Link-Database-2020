It was clear that Courtney's trajectory made him a powerful spokesperson for perseverance. A year-and-a-half earlier, he had been working in a computer store; by the time he played at The Current, Courtney was fielding emails from record labels and had even landed a placement of his single, \"Fire,\" in the soundtrack of the Bradley Cooper film, Burnt. \"It's both a blessing and a curse that for me, giving up was never really something I felt I could do,\" Courtney explains. \"I think everybody's got that thing that's just so hard-wired into them that they can't stop, whatever happens.\"\n\nCourtney said he'd always desired a career in music. \"It was just something I wanted to pursue for as long as I can remember,\" he says. \"I never really thought about, like, 'What if this was a career?' It was just one of those things where, 'This has to be what I do, because what else am I going to do?' I'm a terrible computer salesman!\"\n\nThe next time Courtney visited us in studio was in September 2019; find the link to that session further below.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Hands\"\n02:57 \"Golden Dandelions\"\n05:53 \"Fire\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nBarns Courtney \u2013 vocals and guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan, Helen Teague\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/04/04/barns-courtney-performs-in-the-current-studio\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/09/03/barns-courtney-performs-songs-from-his-new-album-404\nThe Current's Guitar Collection interview, 2016:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/04/13/the-currents-guitar-collection-barns-courtney-martin-ooo15m\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SRfIrZPlI8", "date_published": "2020-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Sam Roberts - I Feel You (Live at The Current)", "description": "The Sam Roberts band, the five-person Canadian indie-rock band led by their namesake singer-songwriter, released their fourth full-length album, \"Collider,\" in 2011.
