## Barns Courtney - full 2016 solo session

The first time Barns Courtney performed in The Current studio, it was a solo visit in 2016. It was clear that Courtney's trajectory made him a powerful spokesperson for perseverance. A year-and-a-half earlier, he had been working in a computer store; by the time he played at The Current, Courtney was fielding emails from record labels and had even landed a placement of his single, "Fire," in the soundtrack of the Bradley Cooper film, Burnt. "It's both a blessing and a curse that for me, giving up was never really something I felt I could do," Courtney explains. "I think everybody's got that thing that's just so hard-wired into them that they can't stop, whatever happens."

Courtney said he'd always desired a career in music. "It was just something I wanted to pursue for as long as I can remember," he says. "I never really thought about, like, 'What if this was a career?' It was just one of those things where, 'This has to be what I do, because what else am I going to do?' I'm a terrible computer salesman!"

The next time Courtney visited us in studio was in September 2019; find the link to that session further below.
