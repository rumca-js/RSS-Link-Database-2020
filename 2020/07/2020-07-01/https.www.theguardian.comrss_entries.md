I love spending time with my two-year-old and my five-year-old. But it’s probably true to say that my main role was to drive them to stuff and go with them to the park.

Honestly, the five-year-old’s imminent first six-week school holiday was a worry. But it’s not like anybody would expect me to be solely in charge of him for all that time (or more).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/jul/01/i-found-myself-in-charge-of-the-kids-did-lockdown-make-me-a-better-dad">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Comedy tips from Steve Martin, film-making lessons from David Lynch, ballet insights from Misty Copeland … our writer signs up for MasterClass, the star-studded online tutorial service that’s booming in lockdown<br /></p><p>‘I lived in a hammock in the jungle for one-and-a-half years,” says Werner Herzog. “And it was fine. I ate snakes, alligators and giant crawling maggots.” In that calm, steely voice familiar to anyone who has seen his documentaries, the German director is talking about his commitment to film-making, casually mentioning the time he threatened to murder Klaus Kinski and how, in turn, the actor planned to murder him. He also talks about being shot, forging the president of Peru’s signature on film permits, on-set plane crashes and refusing to stay at Nicolas Cage’s home because he couldn’t face watching egg dribble down his lead actor’s chin at breakfast time.</p><p>I’ve spent six hours in the company of Herzog, sitting rapt as he talked me through the insights he has picked up in the course of a wild career, in which tradition and convention have been treated with disdain. “The three-act film is ridiculous,” he says. “It’s brainless – the signature of a mediocre film.” Although he calls directing “a series of failures and banalities”, his love for the end result is clear. “I’m morphing into Brando,” he says softly, as he stares transfixed at Marlon in the opening scene of 1952’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/sep/16/marlon-brando-reel-history">Viva Zapata!</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/01/masterclass-videos-lessons-with-werner-herzog-margaret-atwood-david-lynch-online-tutorialslynch">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rise in harvesting could affect ability to combat climate crisis due to carbon absorption capacity reducing</p><p>Europe has lost a vastly increased area of forest to harvesting in recent years, data suggests, reducing the continent’s carbon absorption capacity and possibly indicating wider problems with the EU’s attempts to combat the climate crisis.</p><p>Many of the EU’s forests – which account for about 38% of its land surface area – are managed for timber production, and thus harvested regularly. But the loss of biomass increased by 69% in the period from 2016 to 2018, compared with the period from 2011 to 2015, according to satellite data.

## Jenni Murray: ‘I hate the diet industry. It’s caused me misery’

<p>The Woman’s Hour presenter has written a book about her lifelong struggle with her weight. She discusses fat-shaming, body positivity and what happened when she had bariatric surgery</p><p>A few years ago, Jenni Murray was out walking with her son and dogs when she saw a potential vision of her future. While she was strolling painfully around the park, stopping to rest at benches where she could, a woman not much larger than Murray passed them on a mobility scooter, her own dogs’ leads attached to the handlebars. If Murray – at 24 stone (152kg) – didn’t do something about her weight, her concerned son said, that might be her before long. How did she feel about herself at that point?</p><p>“Extremely obese,” she says. “I was not the fit, active person that I wanted to be. I just lumbered everywhere. I’d had breast cancer and a double hip replacement in my 50s, but it was the obesity that was going to kill me.” It was the final push Murray needed, after a lifetime of dieting, and a warning from her doctor that she was on the way to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/type-2-diabetes-uk-obesity-crisis-nhs">developing type 2 diabetes</a>. “I thought, I’ve got to do something about it, I’m 64 and I’m not going to make it to 70.” She adds, triumph in her voice, “And I did make it to 70!” She reached the milestone birthday in May.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/01/jenni-murray-i-hate-the-diet-industry-its-caused-me-misery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A recently bereaved policeman suspects a friend of adultery with his now-dead wife in this edge-of-seat psychological drama-thriller</p><p>This bizarre and sometimes scary film from Iceland has a way of keeping you off balance and on the edge of your seat. It is a psychological drama-thriller involving startling aesthetic choices from its writer-director Hlynur Palmason, switching up in its third act from subtlety to unsubtlety, but with stunning, deliberate force. For most of the time, the film has been a slow burner, and yet the final 20 minutes or so reveal that this slow burning has merely been that of the lit fuse, fizzling and crackling its way towards the bomb.</p><p>Like The Lord of the Rings, this film ends a number of times, and there was more than one moment when I was (wrongly) certain that the final credits were about to roll. Yet it never ceases to exert a grip, especially with its enigmatic opening sequence showing a car driven at speed across a hazy landscape: we are invited to suspect a clever twist … and then un-suspect it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/01/a-white-white-day-review-drama-thriller-policeman">Continue reading...</a>

High up in the stand above me at Carrow Road, a seagull is roosting and making a right old racket. It seems to be distracting the Norwich defence too, as Nathan Redmond strolls through and scores to put Southampton 3-0 up. There’s a brief cheer and a polite round of applause from a couple of Saints staff members in the stand before Redmond performs a Black Power salute. It’s all very surreal. Black Lives Matter meets Behind Closed Doors football.

## Worth the hype: are  Dior's Air Jordans the most-wanted trainers of all time?

<p>The fashion house’s update of Michael Jordan’s classic footwear is set to bring joy to sneakerheads and point the way forward for luxury shopping. Is this the restart of hype?</p><p>Two months ago, it was modish to theorise that consumer desire for extravagant luxury fashion might never recover from the pandemic. But two months is a long time in fashion, and this week sees the blockbuster must-have come roaring back into style. On 1 July, an online prize draw will decide the lucky few who have won the privilege of spending £1,800 on the new Air Dior trainers. Even by the hype standards of the sneakerhead world, the buzz around the luxury take on basketball’s most iconic hi-top is breaking pre-pandemic decibel records.</p><p>Next week’s pop-up Selfridges “collection point” for the first Air Jordan 1 OG Dior sneakers will be the first luxe iteration of the click-and-collect retail mode that is part of our contactless new normal. The hands-on elements of the pop-up had to be shelved to comply with social distancing and sanitising guidelines, but – for 13 days only – Selfridges aims to bring an experiential element to the process of picking up a pair of pre-purchased trainers. A bespoke architectural experience “based on the concept of air” features glass walls that cloud up with “smoke” to reveal the Air Dior logo, and a real-time countdown showing how many pairs are still to be collected.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jul/01/dior-air-jordans-most-wanted-trainers-of-all-time">Continue reading...</a>
