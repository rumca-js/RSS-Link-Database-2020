Is there a middle ground to the controller vs mouse & keyboard war?? Is JoyShockMapper any good? Want to add air mouse functionality and use stuff you already have? That’s what Jibb Smart aimed to do with his development of JoyShockMapper, allowing users to easily integrate the Dual shock 4, Switch pro controller, and Joy Cons into everyday gaming similar to that of the Xbox controller.
