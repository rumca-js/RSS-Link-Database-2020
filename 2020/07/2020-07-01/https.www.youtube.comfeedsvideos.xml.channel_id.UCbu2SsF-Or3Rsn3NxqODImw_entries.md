After some hands-on time with Ubisoft's new Battle Royal Hyper Scape, Michael Higham breaks down everything we've learned so far.

Hyper Scape is an upcoming battle royale shooter that’s developed and published by Ubisoft. GameSpot’s Michael Higham was able to play for two hours ahead of the official announcement and is joined by Tony Wilson to tell you about the game’s weapons, abilities, revives, and unique way to win. Hyper Scape distinguishes itself from other battle royale games with a few fresh takes on typical genre tropes and mechanics. 

Hyper Scape’s combat feels like an arena shooter with high mobility and mechanics like a double jump and jump pads on the map. You get to pick from a roster of characters that only make a difference cosmetically and with voice lines. You can build a loadout around hacks which are abilities that can be picked up around the map and give players powers such as forming a wall, invisibility, or allowing them to turn into something like a hamster ball and leap great heights. When you die in this battle royale you remain invisible and must find your way to where an enemy is killed by your team in order to be revived. You are never out permanently as long as your team is alive. The map also doesn’t have a closing circle, instead, it has districts that shut down as the match progresses. The game also has a crown that allows one of the final teams to win by surviving a countdown without having to be the last one standing. 

Hyper Scape is coming to PC. Stay tuned for more information on betas and the release date.

## Mortal Shell - Souls Style Combat And Massive Boss Battle

Here's gameplay of the full Mortal Shell demo, including plenty of combat, shell and weapon combos, as well as a climactic boss battle. 

Upcoming action-RPG Mortal Shell draws a whole lot of inspiration from From Software's Souls games--you'll find yourself in a dark fantasy world, engaging in tense, deliberate combat with enemies that can easily rip you apart if you let them. But while Mortal Shell is just as punishing as Dark Souls (and, seemingly, just as careful with its worldbuilding and stingy with its story details), it offers some new ideas to the formula From has popularized to bring some new challenges.

We played a short preview build of Mortal Sell, which gave us a sense of its Souls-like combat--check it out in the video above. You have a lot of similar abilities to Souls games, like dodge rolls and parries, as well as a devastating riposte attack that's almost exactly like Bloodborne's Visceral Attack. But Mortal Shell changes things up with two additions: the "harden" ability, which allows you to turn yourself to stone and weather an attack, either to stagger an enemy or get in close for a strike of your own; and the "shells," which are character bodies you can switch between to make use of their different strengths and weaknesses.

Our time with Mortal Shell gave us a chance to try out two different shells and two different weapons, while engaging in a bunch of combat with various enemies. The preview build culminates in a big, climactic boss fight. If you're a fan of the Souls games, Mortal Shell should scratch the same itch, while adding new ways to overcome challenges.

Microsoft reportedly has a date for its live event coming later this month, Cyberpunk 2077 cuts wall-running, and Crash Banidcoot 4 doesn't have microtransactions.

Speculation arose about whether or not Crash Bandicoot 4 would have microtransactions after the Microsoft Store's listing for the game said it "offers in-app purchases." The game's developer Toys For Bob took to Twitter to clear things up, stating that it doesn't include microtransactions at all.

Check out our interview with Crash Bandicoot 4's producer here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHS3ps6gzA8

CD Projekt Red has removed wall-running from Cyberpunk 2077. Level designer Max Pears told GameReactor that the developer chose to remove it for design reasons, but said that the game will still allow the player "a lot of flexibility" with how they move through the world.

## Xbox Series X Could've Been Here In August | Save State

Persia talks about Microsoft's original plan to launch the Xbox Series X in August of this year. Of course, due to the pandemic and no E3, that launch date was delayed to the 2020 holiday season. This also means that the unannounced but heavily rumored Project Lockhart has also been delayed. It has been suggested that the official announcement will happen this August instead. 

Persia also talks about a recent discovery that you can pet the cats in Cyberpunk 2077. There is no word on the ability to pet the dogs, however. Considering the fact that Geralt couldn't pet cats in The Witcher, this is a small detail that feels like a big win for the cat-lovers out there. 

Lastly, during #PlayForAll, the voice actors of Arthur Morgan, Sadie Adler, and Dutch from Red Dead Redemption 2 joined Lucy James and shared some insight on content that didn't make it into the game. We already knew that about five hours worth of content that did not made it to the final game, but Roger Clark talked about a specific mission that he was sad to see let go.
