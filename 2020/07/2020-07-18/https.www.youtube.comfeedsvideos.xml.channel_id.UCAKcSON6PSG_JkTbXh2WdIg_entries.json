As a preview of what's to come on tonight's broadcast, here are two songs from Babes in Toyland's set \u2013 including a song whose name became the band name of another hard-rocking Minneapolis band inspired by Babes in Toyland. And as you're watching these performances, you've gotta ask yourself: Is there a more joyful drummer than Lori Barbero? \n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Bruise Violet\"\n3:59 \"Sweet '69\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nKat Bjelland \u2013 vocals, guitar\nMaureen Herman \u2013 bass \nLori Barbero \u2013 drums \n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark, Corey Schreppel\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2015 Rock the Garden feature: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2012/06/27/brandicarlile-live\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdLFIApVFiM", "date_published": "2020-07-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
