US data

CDC being bypassed in the collection of COVID-19 data

Department of Health and Human Services

Hospitals ordered to send all COVID-19 patient information to a central database in 
Washington DC

https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf

https://www.newsweek.com/health-experts-fear-covid-data-will-hidden-public-after-trump-orders-hospitals-bypass-cdc-1517968

Federal order

Hospitals are now required to submit COVID-19 data directly to the Department of Health and Human Services

Instead of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Streamlined and faster

Data not publicly accessible

Option to report data to state officials, with a written release


Daily updates on English Covid-19 deaths paused

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/18/daily-updates-on-english-covid-19-deaths-paused-amid-accuracy-concerns

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk

Currently the daily deaths measure counts all people who have tested positive and since died

No cut-off between time of testing and date of death

PHE regularly looks for people on the NHS database who have ever tested positive, and simply checks to see if they are still alive or not

In Scotland and NI, there is a 28-day cut-off

After which a patient who has tested positive is not automatically considered to have died 
from the virus

International comparisons are misleading because countries record coronavirus deaths differently


UK, Millions of antibody tests

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/17/exclusive-game-changing-coronavirus-antibody-test-passes-first/

Oxford University in partnership with leading UK diagnostics firms, Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC) 

98.6 % accurate

20 minutes

98.8% sensitivity (misses 1.2% of actual positive cases giving a false negative)

98.4% specificity (gives a false positive in 1.6% of cases of people who are actually negative)

Millions by end of the year

Healthcare professionals first

Then millions of people to use at home

Send in their results to a central database.

Each kit will come in a box with a QR barcode and instructions

Uses the "full-length spike protein" 

To capture so-called IgG antibodies

IgM first 23 days

IgG up to 49 days

Flu vaccine

Many governors and mayors have loosened restrictions in recent weeks

We still have not reached the peak in Brazil

Because of successive epidemics occurring in various regions

South Brazil

Spread to the interior

An older population

Cold and humidity

India

Cases, +34,884 = 1,038,716

Numbers expected to double by 10th August

Infections spreading to more rural areas

Victoria

Directions will be updated to send a clear message
We are facing a pandemic and this is not the time for parties

This includes traveling to regional Victoria to attend
 
https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/face-masks-covid-19

Transmission driver

Decrease in the number of cases being spread between families

Majority of outbreaks, people are working closely together.

Inspections and enforcement blitz will be carried out in workplaces across the state.

Aged care and health care settings, transmission remains high

22 July, visitation will be restricted to those defined as carers

Masks in Melbourne

https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/updates/coronavirus-covid-19/face-coverings-mandatory-melbourne-and-mitchell-shire

11:59pm on Wednesday 22 July

Chance to buy or make a covering

But if you already have one, please start wearing it now

If you don't have a mask, a scarf is better than nothing. 

As with everything, this shouldn't be about looking for loopholes. 

It's about each of us doing something small to keep everyone around us safe.

“those who have encountered the virus and achieved complete immunity”

Still no herd immunity

England and Wales, w/e 3 July 2020 (Week 27)

Community based survey (not hospitals or care homes)

Deaths involving COVID-19, 532 (5.8% of all deaths in that week)

8th July, 24,000 infections, antigen testing, (1 in 2,300 of the population).

Estimated 1,700 new cases of COVID-19 per day, equivalent to 1 in every 5,000

Modelling shows evidence that the decrease in COVID-19 rates has levelled off

COVID-19 Infection Survey
https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26#infectionstudy

Data up to 8th July

Based on 4,309 blood samples received since the start of the study on 26 April 2020

1 in 16 people (6.3%) who provided blood samples up to 8 July 2020 tested positive for 
COVID-19 antibodies

This equates to 2.8 million people in England

Face coverings when outside the home
 https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/articles/coronaviruscovid19roundup/2020-03-26#infectionstudy

61% reported wearing a face covering when leaving their home in the past seven days
up from 52% the week before.

10% had used a pub or restaurant

9% hairdresser

Oxford Vaccine Group, Coronavirus immunity in children

https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/ovg-study-sheds-light-on-coronavirus-immunity-in-children


Oxford Vaccine Group, Public Health England, National Institute for Health Research

750 families in the trial

Prevalence of COVID-19 in children

Checking for coronavirus antibodies

3 % to 4 % of children tested positive for antibodies

Possible underestimate

Higher percentage in London

Of those who tested positive, fewer than 10 % showed any symptoms of COVID-19

Therefore children have similar infection rates to adults but a higher proportion are asymptomatic

Very few children and teenagers are experiencing COVID-19 symptoms

Less ACE-2 receptors

Cross immunity with other recent coronaviruses

Children are very good at spreading the influenza virus

But not so good at spreading COVID-19


Memory T cells

May mean we have more immunity than antibodies indicate

Stockholm
https://www.ovg.ox.ac.uk/news/ovg-study-sheds-light-on-coronavirus-immunity-in-children

IgM first 23 days

IgG up to 49 days

Blood donors in May

15% had antibodies, 30% had memory T cells
