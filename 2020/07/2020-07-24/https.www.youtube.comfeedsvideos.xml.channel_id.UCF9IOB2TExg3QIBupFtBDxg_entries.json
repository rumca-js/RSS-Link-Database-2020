outbreak originated in Wuhan city, which is a major domestic and international transport hub. \n\nGiven the large population movements, expected to significantly increase during the Chinese New Year in the last week of January, \n\nand the observed human to human transmission, \n\nit is not unexpected that new confirmed cases will continue to appear in other areas and countries.\n\nWith the information currently available for the novel coronavirus, \n\nWHO advises that measures to limit the risk of exportation or importation of the disease should be implemented, \n\nwithout unnecessary restrictions of international traffic.\n\n3rd February\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-who/who-chief-says-widespread-travel-bans-not-needed-to-beat-china-virus-idUSKBN1ZX1H3\n\nWHO

underline that 99% of the cases are in China and 97% of the deaths are in Hubei Province. \n\nThis is still first and foremost an emergency for China. \n\nWe continue to work closely with the Chinese
