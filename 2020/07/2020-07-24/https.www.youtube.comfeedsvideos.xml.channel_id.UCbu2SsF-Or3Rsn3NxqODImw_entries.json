From 2001's Halo: Combat Evolved to 2020's Halo Infinite, the franchise has seen quite a few changes over the years.\n\nIn the video above, Persia details those changes over the course of Halo's six mainline entries, throwing in a few words for the franchise's notable spin-offs, Halo 3: ODST and Halo Reach. Some of the changes have been narrative driven--Halo 2, for example, introduced a new playable character in the Arbiter. However, some changes were more gameplay-focused, like Halo 3's introduction of split screen co-op in the main campaign.\n\nHalo hasn't merely changed on the campaign side either--it's multiplayer has seen numerous overhauls over the course of the franchise's history. Halo 3: ODST, for instance, introduced a brand-new horde mode called Firefight and dropped dual-wielding altogether. But there have been more transformative changes as well, the most notable of which has to be Forge mode. Not only did Forge mode open up the floor for the community to create its own maps, the addition led to the creation of game types that were so popular that developers Bungie and 343 Industries would go on to recognize them as permanent game modes, like Grifball. \n\nIf you're looking to catch up on Halo's story prior to the Holiday 2020 release of Halo Infinite, then your best bet is picking up Halo: The Master Chief Collection. The collection contains Halo Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo Reach, and Halo 4. Other than Halo 5: Guardians, that's every game that Persia talks about in the video above.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vlsh6TS2Sro", "date_published": "2020-07-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Top 5 Call of Duty: Warzone Moments Of The Week", "description": "Here are 5 Call Of Duty moments brought to you by the Warzone community. \n\nCall of Duty: Warzone is full of awesome, hilarious, and big-brain moments- sometimes all at once. This is our roundup of the top 5 Call of Duty: Warzone Moments of the week. \n\nIn our first clip, Reddit user KuzushiKavanagh makes a seemingly impossible save. After his friend FeedtheP0ny is downed on top of stadium, the only way he can pick his friend up is by letting him fall down. FeedtheP0ny plummets down to his friend in this hilarious mid-air revive. \nIn our second clip, Reddit user Releasethesnacken finds himself surrounded by an entire enemy squad...only they don\u2019t even know it. He\u2019s able to hide behind three other enemies on the back of a pickup truck and go entirely unnoticed. That is until he wipes them all out using his R9-0 shotgun.\n\nClip number 3 features Twitter user Fhoowd in quite the pickle. Surrounded by two riot-shielding enemies, Fhoowd attempts to take them head-on. Unfortunately, the two enemies aren\u2019t letting up and are making their way closer for the kill. Low on ammo, Fhoowd thinks quickly and drops his ammunitions box, which when fired at can be used much like a claymore explosive. As the shielders move in for the kill, Fhoowd drops the box and fires on it, killing both enemies at once. This incredibly risky move proved worthwhile for Fhoowd as he takes a few seconds for a victory tea-bagging.  \n\nClip 4 is a terrifying look at what a glitchy operator skin can look like. If you want to pick up the Earth Expeditionary Force pack you\u2019ve been warned. To round off our list, clip 5 comes from a Playstation Network user by the name of Pete_392. Pete is separated from his team when he comes across two enemies within inches of his position. Luckily, with the help of his riot shield, he\u2019s able to go unnoticed in a corner for nearly a minute. Shocking still is that he manages to stealthily take down both enemies as they still have no idea he\u2019s even in the same building as he is. \n\nMid-air revive: Reddit u/KuzushiKavanagh\n\nShotgun Stowaway: Reddit u/releasethesnacken\n\nAmmo Box Legend: Twitter @Fhoowd_\n\nCharly Bundle Disaster: Reddit: u/TarMAC_BBQ\n\nStealth Soldier: PSN: Pete_392", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbxR-3TJXcw", "date_published": "2020-07-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Crash Bandicoot 4 Brings Nostalgia & Pure Platforming Joy", "description": "Crash Bandicoot 4: It\u2019s About Time is Activision\u2019s latest play for your feelings of nostalgia. A sequel to Naughty Dog\u2019s original Crash trilogy, It\u2019s About Time is a brand-new mainline instalment developed by Toys for Bob and slated for release in October on PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nAhead of release, Alessandro and Eddie got some hands-on time with the game, and in a new video, they share their overall impressions. The video covers two different levels, Dino Dash and Snow Way Out, and they could not be more different. One has you escaping a gigantic t-rex and the other is set in a frosty world with zombie fishermen.\n\nThe video showcases gameplay not only featuring Crash as the playable character, but also the villainous Dr. Neo Cortex. He\u2019s cartoonishly evil, even going as far to joke about making Bandicoot soup. Also in the video, Alessandro and Eddie speak about the game\u2019s new masks, which give you the ability to slow down time and phase the world, while they also discuss how It\u2019s About Time is delivering story in a new and interesting way.\n\nIt\u2019s About Time launches on October 2 for PS4 and Xbox One.
