AstraZeneca and GSK both release results this week. But picking winners in the sector may be complicated<p>It was the press announcement heard around the world: a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/20/oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-triggers-immune-response-trial-shows" title="">potential Covid-19 vaccine</a> from the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca had not only been “tolerated” by patients, but “generated robust immune responses against the Sars-CoV-2 virus in all evaluated participants”. The project will now proceed to all-important phase 3 trials in Brazil and South Africa to test if it actually stops infection.</p><p>For a global population that has seen its movement curtailed and its health threatened, it was a welcome dose of good news. It is also a large feather in the cap for AstraZeneca, whose boss, Pascal Soriot, will unveil financial results for the first half of 2020 on Thursday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/24/covid-19-big-pharma-chance-to-impress-astrazeneca-glaxosmithkline-picking-winners">Continue reading...</a>

## Our slum future: the planning shakeup set to blight English housing

<p>The government has extended rules allowing former offices, shops and warehouses to be converted into housing – as research shows the policy results in dwellings unfit for human habitation</p><p>The Conservative government has a known mistrust of experts, but rarely do ministers fly in the face of their own commissioned research as starkly as the housing secretary did this week. On the very same day that Robert Jenrick <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/new-laws-to-extend-homes-upwards-and-revitalise-town-centres">triumphantly extended permitted development rights</a> (PDR), allowing a range of building types to be converted into housing without planning permission, his own ministry <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/quality-standard-of-homes-delivered-through-change-of-use-permitted-development-rights">published a report</a> condemning the same rules for leading to “worse quality” homes.<br /><br />After studying hundreds of new homes carved out from converted offices, shops, warehouses and industrial buildings, created between 2015 and 2018 through permitted development, a team of academics from University College London and the University of Liverpool found predictably grim results. The planning loophole had unleashed a new breed of tiny, dingy apartments, many barely fit for human habitation, with rooms accessed from long corridors, windows looking across internal atriums into other people’s rooms, and some bedrooms with no windows at all.<br /><br />The research found that only 22% of dwellings created through permitted development met the nationally described space standards, compared with 73% of units created with full planning permission. They frequently came across studio apartments of as little as 16 square metres, less than half the size of the national standard of 37 sq m. Their research also found that the homes were eight times more likely to be located in the middle of a business park or industrial estate, while only 3.5% had access to outdoor space. Buildings converted to homes through permitted development, the researchers concluded, “do seem to create worse quality residential environments than planning permission conversions in relation to a number of factors widely linked to the health, wellbeing and quality of life of future occupiers”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/24/our-slum-future-the-planning-shakeup-set-to-blight-british-housing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Now that Disney owns 20th Century Fox, the maverick superhero could slip easily into the Marvel Cinematic Universe – but there’s no sign of it happening</p><p>In the two years since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/15/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds-weapons-grade-gags-subversive">Deadpool 2</a> was released, it seems the entire world has changed out of all recognition. Hollywood, too. The biggest change in Tinseltown is that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/mar/20/disney-seals-71bn-deal-for-21st-century-fox-as-it-prepares-to-take-on-netflix">Marvel owner Disney also now owns 20th Century Fox</a>, which means the Merc with a Mouth can finally hang out with his playmates in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, just as he does in the comics. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/marvel">Marvel</a> president Kevin Feige has made it clear that this will happen, and that <a href="https://screenrant.com/disney-not-changing-deadpool-kevin-feige/">Deadpool’s R-rated tone will be carried over to the MCU</a>.</p><p>The problem is, there’s still no sign of when Deadpool 3 is going to happen. It is not listed as part of Marvel’s Phase 4, which is currently set to last until at least March 2022. That means there will probably be at least a four-year gap between Deadpools 2 and 3 – if the latter happens at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/24/deadpool-3-delay-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Today’s range of seltzers, cocktails and mixers are often more more suited to cans than bottles, and easier to carry. Here’s our drinks writer’s pick of picnic tipples</p><p>When I started writing pieces about picnic wines at the beginning of my drink writing career, it was all about how to keep your bottle cool and not forgetting to pack the corkscrew. How times have changed. Now, you’re as likely to take a cocktail as a wine, and it’s more likely than not to be in a can. Which is perfect for the socially distanced picnic to which everyone presumably has to bring their own food and drink, though I would be more than a little miffed if anyone had made one of my colleagues’ recipes on these pages and wasn’t prepared to share it.</p><p>I have a problem with cans, though. Not the container as such, which is at least recyclable, nor the temperature – it must be the best way of keeping a drink cold, after all. And they’re obviously safer than glass in transit. It’s the contents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/24/can-do-the-best-picnic-drinks-in-tins-fiona-beckett">Continue reading...</a>

As militarized federal agents are deployed into major cities to snatch protesters and charge them with harsh federal crimes for daring to deface the ruling party’s monuments, most Americans will continue living their normal lives with no discernible changes, at least for the time being.

The Clarence in Stoke Newington, north London, was once Steptoe’s in the 1980s, where, if I crimped my fringe and wore lipstick, they’d serve me halves of lager. Since then, it’s been The Daniel Defoe, The Clarence (again) and the Stoke Newington Tea House (though still, confusingly, serving beer), before reverting to its original name, registered in 1860. This feels apt: the pub had survived equally as frightening things as Covid-19 and managed to stay upright and serve ale. And, yes, now it’s serving potted shrimp with gooseberries, and farinata with sweet and sour aubergine, too, because times must also change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/24/the-clarence-tavern-london-n16-grace-dent-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether you believe the country is in the grip of an explosion of violence significantly depends on what media you listen to</p><p>Mayors across the United States have rejected Donald Trump’s election-season depiction of their cities as awash in violence, and media coverage of peaceful protests in Portland and elsewhere has belied the president’s claims of widespread “anarchy”.</p><p>But for Americans who mainly consume conservative media, Trump’s latest evocation of an “American carnage”, with “a shocking explosion of shootings, killings, murders and heinous crimes of violence” is as plain as the news flashing across the screen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/24/donald-trump-conservative-media-protests-anarchy">Continue reading...</a>

## Take a chance, turn on shuffle: you might hit the jackpot

<p>Shuffle is the cousin of a DJ dropping a banger</p><p>Most people have favourite songs, and the majority of the time we hear them by our own hand. For the most part, I don’t agree with the sentiment that one can play a loved song too much and ruin it. I have a rapacious attitude to things I take great pleasure in, and though we can fall out of love with things and people, it is rare for me to get sick of a song. (Conversely, I do believe in the power of the grower.)</p><p>Songs become favourites for various reasons. Perhaps a track is tied to a memory. Sometimes it is the craft of a near-perfect work. Maybe it is impossible not to dance to. People have favourites that might not induce happiness, but provide some other emotional release. It’s possible the lyrics are extremely relatable. Frequently, it is a combination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/24/take-a-chance-turn-on-shuffle-jackpot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jagged Little Pill made her an icon of female rage – and 25 years later, with a brand new album, there’s still plenty to be angry about</p><p>In the video for her new single, Reasons I Drink, Alanis Morissette appears in a group addiction meeting. The song, set to stabbing piano, traces the difficulty of being in recovery when succumbing to addiction feels so freeing. “I’m <em>such</em> an addict,” says the 46-year-old, Grammy-winning firebrand, howling down the phone from her home in the San Francisco Bay Area. </p><p>Morissette ticks off her top three addictions: “Work addiction, love addiction and food addiction,” she says. She traces her work addiction back to “when I was single digits” (she was always a driven performer), and her eating disorders to her teenage years and 20s, during which she was always “yo-yo-ing”. In the video, she portrays herself as multiple characters: a businesswoman; the 90s MTV star in the same scarf and hat she wore in the video for her biggest hit, Ironic; a mother; the chairperson holding space for others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/24/alanis-morissette-without-therapy-i-dont-think-id-still-be-here">Continue reading...</a>
