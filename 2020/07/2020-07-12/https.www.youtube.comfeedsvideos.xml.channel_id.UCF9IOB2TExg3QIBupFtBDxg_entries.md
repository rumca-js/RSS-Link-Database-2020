https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/13/boris-johnson-says-face-masks-should-be-worn-in-shops-in-england

The scientific evidence of face coverings, and the importance of stopping aerosol droplets; that’s been growing 

So I do think that in shops it is very important to wear a face covering

Heat wave

White house task force, (Brett Giroir)

Deaths expected to go up

Turning around in the next 2 or 3 weeks 

90% of people in hotspots need to wear masks or we will not get control of the virus

Gregg Abbott

May need a lockdown

Death toll will rise

Reporting inconsistencies between states

Texas is one of 24 states that publicly reports only confirmed COVID-19 deaths, not probables

(19% of deaths reported in New York City, was reported as a probable)

Rampant testing shortages

Many patients likely died without being screened

Surge of cases, health care providers in Houston overwhelmed

12 hours or more for emergency room care or ICU beds with respiratory distress

What we’re seeing now in states like Texas is comparable to what we saw in New York City (CDC) 

Death data lag

Incubation

Symptomatic

Complications

Death collation

Reporting

The steep rise in cases that started about mid-June in many states will likely be seen in rising deaths very soon

It is hard to see how they won’t come

It is extremely regrettable that the infections are rapidly spreading among US personnel when we Okinawans are doing our utmost to contain the infections (Okinawa's governor, Denny Tamaki)

Okinawans are shocked by what we were told

We now have strong doubts that the US military has taken adequate disease prevention measures.
