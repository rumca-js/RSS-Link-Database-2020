## The return of benefit sanctions won't help the Covi​d-19 jobs​ crisis | John Harris

<p>As mass unemployment looms, the government is reverting to policies that have wrecked lives and worsened low pay and insecurity </p><p>As the government responds to the looming economic crisis, its approach seems to embody two polar opposites. The money it is spending to revive the economy is, we are told, not just unprecedented, but indicative of a huge change in Tory thinking, which shoves Conservatism away from the tenets of Thatcherism and everything that followed it. Chancellor Rishi Sunak tells us this is an administration “<a href="https://www.conservativehome.com/thetorydiary/2020/07/sunak-whistles-in-the-dark.html">unencumbered by dogma</a>”, Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/04/boris-johnsons-new-deal-is-roosevelt-lite">cites Franklin Roosevelt</a>, and shocked Daily Telegraph columnists warn of a return to “<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/07/07/build-back-better-socialist-trap-boris-not-route-prosperity/">Labour’s paternalistic corporatism</a>”. </p><p>But viewed from another angle, it looks like the government is basically spending vast amounts of cash shoring up an economic model that is now on to its second meltdown in just over a decade. Covid-19 has magnified a social crisis centred on low pay and insecure work, an enduring housing crisis and inequality that defines millions of people’s everyday experience. Yet there is still no sign of any meaningful attempt to change those things. What some people call neoliberalism has, perhaps, reached the stage of high farce, whereby its supposedly rugged, laissez-faire model can only survive thanks to huge bailouts from the state. So, as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Leopard">old quotation</a> goes, for everything to stay the same, everything must change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/poor-people-work-british-jobcentres-labour-benefits">Continue reading...</a>

But it is worth reflecting on the distinctiveness of Britain’s own near recent history, and where there might have been other opportunities to reflect on the big questions about who and what we are.

## Anne Applebaum: how my old friends paved the way for Trump and Brexit

<p>In a powerful new book, the journalist and historian reveals how her former friends and colleagues became agents of populism</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/anneapplebaum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Anne Applebaum</a> can look at the wreck of democratic politics and understand it with a completeness few contemporary writers can match. When she asks who sent Britain into the unending Brexit crisis, or inflicted the Trump administration on America, or turned Poland and Hungary into one-party states, she does not need to search press cuttings. Her friends did it, she replies. Or, rather, her former friends. For if they are now embarrassed to have once known her, the feeling is reciprocated.</p><p>Applebaum’s latest book, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/twilight-of-democracy-9780241419717.html">Twilight of Democracy: The Failure of Politics and the </a></em><em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/twilight-of-democracy-9780241419717.html">Parting of Friends</a></em>, opens with a scene a novelist could steal. On 31 December 1999, Applebaum and her husband, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/radoslaw-sikorski">Radosław Sikorski</a>, a minister in Poland’s then centre-right government, threw a party. It was a Millennium Eve housewarming for a manor house in the western Poland they had helped rebuild from ruins. The company of Poles, Brits, Americans and Russians could say that they had rebuilt a ruined world. Unlike the bulk of the left of the age, they had stood up against the Soviet empire and played a part in the fall of a cruel and suffocating tyranny. They had supported free markets, free elections, the rule of law and democracies sticking together in the EU and Nato, because these causes – surely – were the best ways for nations to help their people lead better lives as they faced Russian and Chinese power, Islamism and climate change.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/12/anne-applebaum-how-my-old-friends-paved-the-way-for-trump-and-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

## Rufus Wainwright: Unfollow the Rules review – a return to sumptuous basics

<p>(BMG)<br />Wainwright’s 10th studio album is a lush, engaging study in domestic bliss</p><p>After almost a decade working in other fields – most notably on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2018/jun/23/rufus-wainwright-opera-transfigured-second-classical-release-change-direction">his second opera</a> and a project <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/rufus-wainwright-9-shakespeare-sonnets-review">putting Shakespeare’s sonnets to music</a> – Rufus Wainwright has recorded his first straightforwardly pop album since 2012’s <em>Out of the Game</em>. Whereas that record, produced by Mark Ronson, was immersed in 70s soft-rock sounds, <em>Unfollow the Rules </em>marks a welcome return to the opulent orchestration of Wainwright’s early albums.</p><p>There’s a genuine sense of contentedness here. Peaceful Afternoon, written for his husband, Jörn Weisbrodt, is an irresistible, guitar-driven paean to domestic bliss (“Between sex and death and tryin’ to keep the kitchen clean”), while the tender My Little You is addressed to Wainwright’s now nine-year-old daughter, Viva. There’s humour, too: Bexhill-on-Sea does not feature much in music folklore, but an encounter there with some over-enthusiastic female fans was the source material for This One’s for the Ladies (That Lunge!), a sumptuous ballad. Elsewhere, he takes lyrical inspiration from Anna Wintour, Joni Mitchell and forgotten statues in west London. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/12/rufus-wainwright-unfollow-the-rules-review-a-welcome-return-to-sumptuous-basics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>During lockdown, anxiety about our health and the economy was on the rise – and the easing of restrictions has brought new worries. Experts describe how to navigate this period<br /></p><p>On one of the worst days of the lockdown, Kat says, she ended up “in the corner of the room sobbing. My workload was through the roof and I couldn’t do anything with the children because I couldn’t take a minute away from it. And they were upset because they were missing their school friends and not wanting to sit and do maths. It all got a bit too much.”</p><p>She works in customer services and had been doing her full-time job from home, as well as trying to home-school her two children, while her husband, a gardener, kept working (she also has a chronic pain condition, made worse by stress). There were several times, she says, when she would turn off her phone and go into the kitchen for a cry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/12/the-summer-of-stress-how-to-cope-with-fear-and-uncertainty-in-a-pandemic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a nation, we’ve been getting into the spirits like never before, says Richard Godwin. If you’re going to mix drinks, here’s how to do it well</p><p>One of the least surprising things about these most surprising times is that Britain is drinking more alcohol – and specifically, cocktails. Towards the end of April, the Office of National Statistics reported a 31.4% increase in volume sales of alcohol nationwide. Waitrose has since shaded in some detail: tequila sales are up 175%, and as liqueur sales are up 78%, too, we can assume that Margarita production has risen by a similar percentage year-on-year.</p><p>My own household’s Negroni output is up 53.6%, annual Sidecar targets were smashed in early May, and all the citrus in my fruit bowl bears the telltale scars of garnish-manufacture. My interest predates lockdown – I wrote <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/sep/04/empire-drinks-cocktails-richard-godwin" title="">a book</a> about cocktails a few years back – but clearly, all the people who bought it are only now getting round to reading it. I keep getting messages along the lines of, “But what else can I make with maraschino?” And, “Is it acceptable to use a whisk when making a Ramos Gin Fizz?” And, “What’s the best vermouth in a Negroni?” For many, clearly, cocktail hour has become an important weekly ritual. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/12/raise-a-cocktail-glass-to-lockdown-we-have-really-been-getting-into-the-spirits">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An aspiring Colombian couple in Connecticut feel their marriage falling apart in this sharply observed novella </p><p>Colombian novelist, essayist and short story writer Margarita García Robayo is well known across Latin America, and widely translated, though only one collection, <em><a href="https://charcopress.com/bookstore/fish-soup">Fish Soup</a></em>, has been available in English. Now, Charco press has followed that with Charlotte Coombe’s translation of García Robayo’s 2017 novel <em>Holiday Heart</em>, a novella that dissects a failing marriage with surgical precision.</p><p>After 19 years, Lucia and Pablo have stopped even “wondering why they’re still there, oozing indifference towards one another”. Then Pablo ends up in hospital with “holiday heart” – cardiovascular disease that often strikes around Christmas and new year, due to overindulging in rich food and booze. It’s not the only thing he’s been indulging in: Lucia is informed that Pablo was delivered to hospital by one of his students. She leaves their home in Connecticut to go to her parents’ holiday apartment in Miami, taking their twin children with her.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/12/holiday-heart-by-margarita-garcia-robayo-review-immigrant-swansong">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A single-parent lawyer and her vitriolic mother fight almost to the death in this superbly acted domestic drama</p><p>There’s an abrasively realist candour to this Colombian portrait of a woman pushed to the brink by the incremental stresses of her daily life. Silvia (Carolina Sanín) is a single parent, a public-sector lawyer tainted by a brewing scandal, and the daughter of Leticia (Leticia Gómez), an explosively ill-tempered widow who responds to her cancer diagnosis with chain-smoking and vitriol.</p><p>It’s this latter element that brings the film, directed by Franco Lolli, its arcing, unpredictable energy. The relationship between Silvia and Leticia is like a magnifying mirror, bouncing and building their matching antagonism. Both performances are superb, but Gómez, as the razor-tongued matriarch, is particularly bracing. Even as she sinks towards death, the sharp edge of her perennial displeasure cuts through her weakness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/12/litigante-review-bracing-portrait-of-a-colombian-woman-on-the-verge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman have been best friends for more than a decade. They care about each other so much they even saw a couples counsellor. Now they’ve written a book about what it takes to stay close for the long haul</p><p>When Aminatou Sow and Ann Friedman first met, at a viewing party for the teen drama <em>Gossip Girl</em> in 2009, each recognised a kindred spirit. “I can tell you for a fact that I viscerally remember the moment Ann and I walked in different directions,” recalls Sow, 35. “I remember just the pang of… Ahh, when am I going to see this person again? That feeling. It’s such a vivid episode in my mind.” When Sow got home that night, she found a friend request from Friedman, now 38, on Facebook. She has heard other friends talk about that same feeling of excitement when it comes to the very beginning of a new, platonic relationship. “We just do not understand them to be an intense emotional experience on the same level that we would give to a romance, for example. But I think the excitement is the same, the butterflies are there.”</p><p>Those butterflies turned into a decade-long, and still going, best friendship. In fact, they like each other so much that they have written a joint memoir of their lives together as friends and colleagues (both are writers and have been co-hosting a podcast, Call Your Girlfriend, since 2014, “for long-distance besties everywhere”). You get the sense, though, that they are using their personal story, with its ups and downs – and there are such downs that at one point, they go to couples’ therapy to salvage their relationship – to sneak in a manifesto of modern friendship, and how to navigate big, emotional platonic relationships successfully. Anyone who has ever experienced the pain of a friendship break-up, yet lacked the words to describe it, will find plenty to take from <em>Big Friendship</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/12/we-went-to-therapy-to-save-our-friendship-aminatou-sow-and-ann-friedman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The London soul sensation, about to release her first album in five years, talks about identity, her friendship with Prince and her political awakening<br /></p><p>Lianne La Havas arrives on her bike, a sturdy looking affair with a wicker front basket. It’s a June morning in Brockwell Park, south London, and the sun is out and the flowers are bright and the world is delicious. There are six of us here, all women; this is the first time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">post-corona crisis</a>, that any of us have been involved in an interview and photo shoot where everyone is outside their own house. A new beginning… And also an end, for in just a few days, the beaches will be packed, the park as full as a festival, parties will get rowdy and be broken up by police, and lockdown will be done. For now, though, we’re in a dreamy, singular moment.</p><p>Up the hill to do the photos in a walled garden. La Havas parks her bike and sits on a bench to apply her makeup. She spends some time on her eyebrows, holds earrings up to see if they suit. A designer friend sent her some clothes to wear, but they were all a bit too hot and stiff, so she’s in a cotton dress that ties at the waist and airs her midriff. She’s calm but friendly. Centred. If you told me she was a yoga teacher, I wouldn’t be surprised.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/12/lianne-la-havas-its-hard-to-fit-in-when-you-have-two-heritages">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brexiters are drawn to the romance of hard-bitten seafarers, so why not repurpose it to boost theatres?</p><p>On the quay at Port Isaac yesterday evening, lit by a midsummer moon, I stood before an assembled shoal of grizzled Cornish fishermen, fat Henry V in Fred Perry, waving my Olivier award like a sword. “I know you. You’ve survived storms at sea, gales that tear trees from fields. You’ve withstood winds that raise roofs, and endured the tossing of tempests. And if you have the courage to do all that, my fishermen friends, then maybe, just maybe, there’s a future for all of you… on the stages of British theatres!” A cheer went up. Oliver Dowden, the new secretary for digital, culture, media and sport, stood behind his film crew, loving what he saw. I knew he would.</p><p>The mythic allure of the British fishing industry was central to the dishonest Brexit campaign of 2016, a propaganda war that finally delivered the most incompetent and cynical government in our union’s modern history. As part of the 2016 offensive Michael Gove claimed the fishing business owned by his father, Ernest, was destroyed by EU policies. That June, however, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jun/15/michael-gove-father-company-eu-policies-fish-processing-aberdeen">Ernest contradicted his addled son</a>, citing factors including competition for docking space from North Sea oil vessels as other reasons for his voluntary sale, complicating his son’s expedient and confected anti-EU narrative.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/of-course-theres-a-future-for-the-british-fishing-industry-on-stage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>First he goes missing, next he’s barrelling downhill. It was different in my day</p><p>For all the stresses and travails of parenting – without which, this column would be sorely depleted – I’m frequently reminded of how easy I have it compared to others. Having come from a family of 11, I’m aware how much easier it is having just one child, even in those moments where my heart is in my mouth and beating itself to death. Last week I took my son to the park so he could have a little run around on his favourite mode of transportation, a weird little trike we got him a few months ago. I say ‘run-around’, but it’s more of a ‘crawl around’ as his trike is an odd, pedal-less contraption, powered by the tiny feet of its driver, which pad him inch by inch along the pavement, at the speed of those marathon runners who collapse just before the finish and have to be helped over the line by their rivals. What it lacks in speed, it more than makes up for in its ability to occupy him for ungodly amounts of time. During which I relax my usual panic about where he is and what he’s doing, since the answer is always, ‘The exact same thing he was doing five minutes ago, but 8cm further along.’</p><p>That was until Wednesday, when he discovered a steep slope and started barrelling down it with the confidence you might not expect of someone who has never exceeded the speed limit of an injured tortoise. In my complacency, I’d missed this descent and for a few terrifying seconds he was completely out of my view. Every horror scenario flashed into my mind. Had he been grabbed by squirrels? Plunged to the fatberg-ridden depths of an unseen drain? Thankfully, these ruminations were short-lived as I found him sprawled at the foot of a tree. There he lay, unharmed and jubilant, having just experienced the drama of the lowest speed crash ever recorded.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/12/the-slowest-trike-crash-in-the-park-and-my-son-is-jubilant">Continue reading...</a>

## Fat Cow, Fat Chance by Jenni Murray review – well meaning but haphazard

<p>Murray’s memoir-cum-polemic about her lifelong struggle with her size is a lightweight in a crowded field </p><p>Jenni Murray’s book about her long struggle with her weight begins as a memoir. The presenter of <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007qlvb">Woman’s Hour</a></em> grew up in Barnsley, a beloved only child in a working-class family. Having been through rationing, her parents and grandparents regarded food as an expression of love, sugar as the greatest possible treat, and the cleaning of one’s plate as a moral duty. To be full was to be happy, and a sign of success. Both her grandmothers were fat.</p><p>All this contented eating, however, ran alongside ideals in the matter of female bodies that were, for her as for most women, hard to meet. Pressure came from within, and without: there was Twiggy, with her swizzle-stick figure, and there was Murray’s mother, Win, who had firm ideas about women who “let themselves go”, and who took huge pride in her tiny ankles. Win, though, seems also to have been motivated by a certain envy in the case of her daughter. When Murray went to university, where she put on a lot of weight, her mother didn’t hold back. “What the hell has happened to you?” she asked. “You look like a baby elephant.” Her daughter’s success, in later life, did nothing to mitigate this attitude. No wonder Murray gravitated towards radio, rather than television, where the double chin with which Win was so weirdly and cruelly preoccupied could not be seen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/12/fat-cow-fat-chance-by-jenni-murray-review-well-meaning-but-haphazard">Continue reading...</a>

Prime ministers invariably grow paranoid about any cabinet colleague who is talked up as an heir apparent<p>Is there room at the top of Conservative politics for two people known by their first names? In the immediate aftermath of their election victory, this government was the “Boris show”. It was all about the Tory hero who had won their best parliamentary majority since the mid-1980s. Now it is the “Boris &amp; Rishi show”. The prime minister has to share the limelight with the much younger guy he accelerated into the chancellorship just four months ago. Sitting on the Commons frontbench while the golden boy had his latest day in the sun, the prime minister’s leg jiggled uncontrollably as he chuntered “absolutely right”.</p><p>He has to live with it for the moment because Rishi Sunak is the one senior minister whom Tory MPs regard as unsackable. The chancellor is the only member of an otherwise floundering government who is widely judged to have had a <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2020/07/10/sunak-most-popular-chancellor-15-years" title="">good coronavirus crisis</a>. “There’s no doubt about it,” says one former cabinet minister, “Boris’s star is falling and Rishi’s star is rising.” His approval ratings easily best the prime minister and anyone else in the cabinet. The bookies and a lot of MPs have him as their favourite to be the next Tory leader.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/12/rishi-sunak-is-an-unwelcome-reminder-to-boris-johnson-of-his-political-mortality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unconscious bias training is a lucrative industry, but it won’t change consciously hostile policies</p><p>Are you racist? And, if so, how would I know?

<p>On the eve of a supreme court hearing for the UK’s biggest joint claim, former women shopworkers describe their six-year quest</p><p>For years, Wendy Arundale was nicknamed Little Miss Asda. At one point her whole family, including her husband and two children, worked at the supermarket. She dyed her hair pink for an Asda breast cancer fundraiser. She ran a hotdog stand for Asda. The 62-year-old grandmother of nine from Middlesbrough spent 32 years of her life working at Asda. It’s fair to say she was a dedicated employee.</p><p>“It makes me feel sad, and I do get bitter now sometimes thinking of how I was treated,” she said, speaking to the <em>Observer</em>. “My husband was paid 80p more than me an hour. I was close to crying at times because I wasn’t valued. The girls were paid terrible compared to the men. It makes you feel stupid. I really loved my job, but I don’t know why I put up with feeling like this for so long.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/12/they-just-got-away-with-paying-men-more-milestone-looms-in-asda-equal-pay-fight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Film fans flocked online during lockdown. As restrictions ease, what’s happening to revive cinema-going and restart shoots? Our critic heads to the cinema to find out<br /></p><p>It’s Saturday lunchtime and I am watching <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/16/sonic-the-hedgehog-review-jim-carrey-sega-video-game">Sonic the Hedgehog</a></em> in a cinema. It’s fair to say that it wouldn’t have been my first choice of film to break my four-month cinema fast (titles also showing at the Genesis in London’s Mile End included <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/19/moonlight-review-five-star">Moonlight</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/09/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho-tragicomic-masterpiece">Parasite</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2007/jan/07/3">Memento</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/jul/10/spikelee-race">Do the Right Thing</a></em> and previews of a forthcoming new release, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjPKv3Wx8k4">Black Water: Abyss</a></em>). But the nine-year-old got to pick and he reasoned that, since I missed it when it was first released, I absolutely must want to catch up with it now.</p><p>What’s remarkable is how reassuringly ordinary the whole experience is. Online booking automatically enforces social distancing around your chosen seats. Not that that’s an issue with our screening – there are only six other people here. There’s a plexiglass screen between the box office and the punters, a roped-off one-way system, staggered start times and wall-mounted hand-sanitisers. Some staff are wearing masks.

With bad news on jobs, and ongoing risk from Covid-19, hopes for a V-shaped recovery look misplaced<p>How quickly can Britain’s economy rebound after the pandemic? Last week, the chancellor, Rishi Sunak set out an upbeat recovery vision, with a plan to get restaurants buzzing again. It was perhaps the swiftest gear change in years: just days earlier, restaurants in England were banned from opening. In Leicester, they remain closed. But from August the government will pay 50% of diners’ bills in an attempt to get them eating out.</p><p>This week the economic outlook is likely to be much less appetising. On Tuesday, the tax and spending watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility, will publish a report on the path ahead for Britain. It probably won’t make for uplifting reading.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jul/12/sunak-economic-v-shaped-recovery-obr-forecasts-job-growth">Continue reading...</a>

Three months on, during a visit to Harlow, Essex, last week, he chose to wear a large plastic visor, putting distance between him and the voters, and safety first.</p><p>“He was right to do that,” said one of his front bench, “because until then, not a single cabinet minister had worn a mask in public since this whole thing began. It was about setting an example. But I did think…how bloody weird.” Even now, as he approaches his 100th day as leader, it’s all very abnormal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/12/100-days-on-keir-starmers-quiet-revolution-takes-hold">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Max Miechowski’s shot of a closed-up ice‑cream parlour alludes to the precarity of seaside towns<br /></p><p>Last summer, the photographer <a href="https://maxmiechowski.com/">Max Miechowski</a> set out to travel the east coast of England, starting in Felixstowe and heading up toward Hartlepool and beyond. Miechowski, 30, grew up a few miles outside Lincoln, and day trips and holidays were mainly to the seaside towns of Yorkshire or Norfolk, so he knew some of the places already. This picture was taken in Skegness, in the early evening, just after the ice-cream parlour had shut up for the day. It has, he suggests, taken on an added poignancy with the events of the past months – the uncertainty of closure set against the hope for brighter months ahead.</p><p>Many of Miechowski’s pictures – of fishermen on beaches set against the silhouette of steel works, or sunbathers near the Sizewell nuclear plant – carry a similar kind of ambiguous romance. He was drawn to the contrasts of the coastline, from the gentrified sea-fronts of Suffolk, to the harder edges of struggling resorts and fishing towns further north; erosion has become a theme, with some communities under threat physically, others economically.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/12/the-big-picture-a-shuttered-seafront-at-sunset">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Côte at Home shows how to do home delivery with flair – assuming dinner turns up… </p><p>A Saturday night and my phone pings. It’s an email from a well-known courier company. Earlier that day they’d confirmed that my delivery from a high-street restaurant chain would arrive the next day. Now they were telling me it was cancelled: “Contact the sender directly for more information.” At 9.30pm on a Saturday night? Gosh, thanks. Last month, when I wrote about the enduring appeal of French food in Britain, I was emailed by a senior person from the high street bistro chain <a href="https://www.cote.co.uk/" title="">Côte</a>. They had just launched their <a href="https://coteathome.co.uk/" title="">Côte </a><a href="https://coteathome.co.uk/" title="">at Home</a> range, available nationwide. Would I like to try it?</p><p>I turn down over 95% of the freebies offered to me. Partly this is because I am drenched in enough privilege as it is. Wet through, I am. Also, where would I put it all? Mostly, though, I decline such because I’d prefer to experience products as other customers would. I’ve never eaten in a branch of Côte, but many people have told me they rather like them: a fair price point, reliable food and good service. (Complaints in 2015 about the unfair use of tips to top up wages led to a change in policy.) Accordingly, I declined the offer of Côte at Home for free and instead booked it myself. Now, here I was very much experiencing the gorgeous life of a valued customer: it was a Saturday night, I’d spent £85, and my planned dinner for Sunday night had disappeared, along with the contents of this column.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/12/jay-rayner-restaurants-cote-deliveries-are-very-good-indeed-when-they-arrive">Continue reading...</a>
