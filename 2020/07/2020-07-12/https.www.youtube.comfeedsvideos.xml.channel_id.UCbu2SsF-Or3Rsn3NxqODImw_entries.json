Ed says he found the combat to be more complex than in past entries, leaning more towards a Dark Souls-style experience. Valhalla has dual-wielding weapons, too, and epic finishing moves that emphasize the game\u2019s overall focus on highlighting the brutality of the Vikings.\n\nAlso in the video, we discuss Valhalla\u2019s various skills and abilities that you can unlock. It looks like Ubisoft is going very deep again this year to let you play with style and flair. Valhalla also includes a new Raid feature where players can take their crew to an encampment and wipe out its inhabitants and then scour the location for treasure. Be sure to watch the full video to hear everything that Jess, Ed, and Jordan had to say about their time with Valhalla.\n\nValhalla launches later this year for PS4, Xbox One, and PC, while people picking up the PS5 or Xbox Series X will be able to play the game on those next-gen consoles, too.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQtsdJmCv9M", "date_published": "2020-07-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla Is The Ultimate Viking Experience", "description": "(Presented by Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla & Xbox) From its brutal combat options to its Dark Age open world, we take a look at why Assassin's Creed Valhalla is aiming to let you live out your greatest Viking fantasies on 11/17 on Xbox One and coming soon to Xbox Series X.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDDHD4fDX1c", "date_published": "2020-07-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "FULL Ubisoft Forward Reveal Event -  July 2020", "description": "Check out all of the big reveals from the Ubisoft Forward July 2020 livestream presentation event.

With his 13-year-old son Diego dutifully at his side, Ant\u00f3n has the future of Yara clenched tightly in his hands.\n\nYara lies in the heart of the Caribbean, a tropical paradise frozen in time. Decades of economic sanctions have devastated the nation, leaving it impoverished and divided. While some Yarans follow Ant\u00f3n blindly, others are subjugated in the name of restoring paradise. As the brutality of his rule reaches a fever pitch, outrage boils over and the fire of insurrection ignites across the country.\rIn Far Cry\u00ae 6, players are immersed in the adrenaline-filled, chaotic world of a modern-day guerrilla revolution. Engage Ant\u00f3n\u2019s regime in intense combat through lush jungles and dense cities as Dani Rojas, a local Yaran swept up in the chaos.
