Sony may have flown too close to the sun with the PS3, but its fall from grace is what led to the PS4’s success. 

The PlayStation 3 stumbled out of the gate back in 2006, nearly costing Sony the console war. But through hard lessons learned, paved the way for the PS4’s overwhelming success. So where did Sony go wrong with the PS3, and how exactly did it right its course? 

Join Kurt Indovina for this episode of Remember When as he looks back on the PS3’s rocky launch, its infamous cell technology, and how Sony managed to climb its way back up the food chain. Kurt also invites CNET editor Jeff Bakalar to give some extra insight, and fill some gaps on the PS3’s troublesome launch.

We recently had a chance to play three hours of Assassin’s Creed Valhalla, and there is a lot to unpack and understand about Ubisoft’s latest entry in its stealthy-stabby series.

In a new video, Jess, Ed, and Jordan speak about their impressions from playing a chunk of the game, covering things like historical accuracy, fantastical elements, and, of course, the combat. Ed says he found the combat to be more complex than in past entries, leaning more towards a Dark Souls-style experience. Valhalla has dual-wielding weapons, too, and epic finishing moves that emphasize the game’s overall focus on highlighting the brutality of the Vikings.

Also in the video, we discuss Valhalla’s various skills and abilities that you can unlock. It looks like Ubisoft is going very deep again this year to let you play with style and flair. Valhalla also includes a new Raid feature where players can take their crew to an encampment and wipe out its inhabitants and then scour the location for treasure. Be sure to watch the full video to hear everything that Jess, Ed, and Jordan had to say about their time with Valhalla.

Valhalla launches later this year for PS4, Xbox One, and PC, while people picking up the PS5 or Xbox Series X will be able to play the game on those next-gen consoles, too.

“Are you evil? Are you a monster?” a ruthless dictator asks his son as they watch protesters call for revolution in the streets. Antón Castillo rose to power on the promise of restoring the once-prosperous island nation of Yara back to its former glory, and plans to forge his vision of paradise by any means necessary. With his 13-year-old son Diego dutifully at his side, Antón has the future of Yara clenched tightly in his hands.

Yara lies in the heart of the Caribbean, a tropical paradise frozen in time. Decades of economic sanctions have devastated the nation, leaving it impoverished and divided. While some Yarans follow Antón blindly, others are subjugated in the name of restoring paradise. As the brutality of his rule reaches a fever pitch, outrage boils over and the fire of insurrection ignites across the country.In Far Cry® 6, players are immersed in the adrenaline-filled, chaotic world of a modern-day guerrilla revolution. Engage Antón’s regime in intense combat through lush jungles and dense cities as Dani Rojas, a local Yaran swept up in the chaos. In a fight where you must use what you have to make what you need, employ an arsenal of unique and surprising new weapons, vehicles, and animal companions to unite a revolution that will burn the tyrannical regime to the ground.

Take a look at the first cinematic trailer for the latest entry in the Far Cry series shown during Ubisoft Forward.
