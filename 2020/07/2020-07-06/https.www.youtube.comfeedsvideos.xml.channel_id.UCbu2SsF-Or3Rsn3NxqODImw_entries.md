Thirty minutes of Assassin's Creed Valhalla has found its way online, revealing a first look at the female version of Eivor. The footage is from what appears to be an early build of the game, so it's likely we'll see a much more polished portion of the game during this weekend's Ubisoft Forward event. That's happening on Sunday, July 12 at 12 PM PT / 3 PM ET.

Take-Two is currently working on a new BioShock without its creator, designer, and writer Ken Levine. He, however, is, working on a new game within Take-Two that will have "some weird sh** in it." We don't know much else about the game other than it's being developed by Ghost Story Games, which Levine runs as president. In the meantime, the next BioShock is being developed by Cloud Chamber.

Lastly, the next Xbox Series X stream officially got a date and time: Thursday, July at 9 AM PT / noon ET.  There are still Xbox 20/20 events to come, and we still don't have an official price or release date.

## Weird West Keeps The Immersive Sim Alive

Weird West is an upcoming immersive sim and action-RPG set in the wild west that's being developed by WolfEye Studios, which is led by former Arkane president Raphael Colantonio. For GameSpot's Play For All, we spoke to Colantonio--who is best known for his work on Prey and the Dishonored series--about Weird West and how his history as an experienced game developer makes working on a new game feel like a New Game Plus mode.

In the video above, Colantonio talks about how Weird West is inspired by early immersive sim games like System Shock, the original Fallout, and Ultima VII. Though Weird West begins as a traditional western-style story, the narrative quickly descends into the supernatural. These supernatural themes tie into the immersive sim mechanics.

You'll play as five different people in Weird West, but not all at once. Instead, you'll go from one hero to the next--like the baton in a relay race. This means that if the hero you're playing as is still alive by the time the story transitions to the next playable protagonist, you can meet the character you were previously playing as. You can even recruit the heroes you've already played as to your party.

Weird West is set to release for PC in 2021 and may have a closed beta later this year.
