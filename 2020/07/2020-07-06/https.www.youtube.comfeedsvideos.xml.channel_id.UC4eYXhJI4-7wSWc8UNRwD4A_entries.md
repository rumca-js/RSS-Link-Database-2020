The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

It's very appropriate that Chicano Batman's Tiny Desk Home Concert comes with the band members in four separate boxes.

The group has been an Alt.Latino favorite, almost from the beginning, and I've always enjoyed listening to how creatively they've crafted their musical identity with layers of sound, from vintage organs to the most nuanced of funk grooves. So, watching them in their individual Hollywood-Squares-type boxes is the visual equivalent to how I listen to them.

The songs performed are from their new album, Invisible People which, coincidentally, is a major shift in their group sound. As you hear in songs like "Polymetronomic Harmony," their sound is now much denser, with full-on references to a variety of influences, including the 1973, Herbie Hancock funk-jazz classic Head Hunters, which makes a walk-on appearance in the stack of vinyl just behind guitarist Carlos Arévalo.

Vocalist and keyboardist, Bardo Martinez, bassist, Eduardo Arenas, and drummer, Gabriel Villa all close their eyes during the performances, and you can both see and hear how they mentally inhabit the same musical place that has made them a favorite and clubs and festivals for nearly ten years, now.

Even as they each perform in their home music spaces, they can't avoid bringing it all together to give us a Chicano Batman performance that grooves hard and brings a smile to our faces.

July 6, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- We've loved Dirty Projectors for more than a dozen years - from the band's Black Flag covers record to the brilliant angular sounds we presented at SXSW, and more recently, a candlelit Tiny Desk concert in 2018. The lineup often shifts, but the creative nature of this band, headed by David Longstreth, doesn't. The band is releasing 5 EPs this year. The lineup for this includes Maia Friedman on vocals, keyboard and guitar, Felicia Douglass on vocals and tabletop percussion, Kristin Slipp on vocals and keytar, and drummer Mike Johnson shaking and tapping all things tiny. It's a band in which any member can take the lead, and that's the beauty here. We see Dirty Projectors change and surprise us with each new song, something so rare and vibrant.

SET LIST
"Lose Your Love"
"Overlord"
"Inner World"
"Search For Life"
MUSICIANS
Felicia Douglass: vocals, percussion; Maia Friedman: vocals, keys, guitar; Kristin Slipp: vocals, keytar; David Longstreth: guitar, bass, piano; Mike Daniel Johnson: drums
