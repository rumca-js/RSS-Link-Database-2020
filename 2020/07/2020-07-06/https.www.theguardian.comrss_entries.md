<p>Noctilucent clouds, on the edge of the atmosphere, are increasingly seen outside of polar regions</p><p>Something magical appeared at night over London and other parts of Britain on 21 June: ripples of electric blue clouds shimmered in the twilight sky after sunset. These were noctilucent clouds, the highest clouds in the world, more than 80km (50 miles) up on the edge of space, and looked like something from another planet.</p><p>Noctilucent clouds form in the mesosphere, the rarefied upper atmosphere with little moisture and intensely low temperatures. The scant water vapour there can freeze on to specks of smoke from meteors burning up in the atmosphere, creating the crystals that form noctilucent clouds. The mesosphere is coldest in summer, allowing the crystals to form.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jul/06/rare-night-clouds-may-be-warning-sign-of-climate-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Culture needed a lifeline, and has got one. Now the sector must avoid treading water</p><p>There are as many reasons to applaud the UK government’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/05/boris-johnson-uk-lifeline-arts-heritage-sector-afloat" title="">decision to pump £1.57bn into the arts</a> as there are theatres, concert halls, galleries, libraries, singers, dancers, acrobats, violinists, costume designers, stagehands, artists, audience members and myriad other people and organisations that will benefit from this injection. The arts sector had been poleaxed by the coronavirus pandemic. While culture, along with nature, has been a source of consolation during recent months, this has mainly applied to those forms enjoyed at home: television, recorded music, books. For live performance and museums, the pandemic has felt more like a kiss of death, as buildings have stood empty and productions have been shelved. The <a href="https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/news/leicester-news/coronavirus-forces-leicesters-haymarket-theatre-4157049" title="">Haymarket Theatre in Leicester</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/02/nuffield-southampton-theatres-to-permanently-close-as-uk-arts-crisis-deepens" title="">Nuffield Southampton Theatres</a> have already announced that they are closing.</p><p>Ministers should have acted sooner. It is more than a month since the German government announced a bailout package including <a href="https://news.artnet.com/art-world/germany-another-1-billion-culture-bailout-1878870#:~:text=Germany%20has%20released%20a%20new,museums%2C%20theaters%2C%20and%20festivals." title="">€1bn set aside for culture</a>. But the unexpected generosity of the package announced on Sunday shows that campaigners put the extra time to good use, both in public and private. By persuading the government to invest in the arts, the sector has won an important argument. Not only has the government accepted that the arts are of vital importance to the economy, it has also recognised that their value is not purely instrumental. Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, described them as “crown jewels” and “the soul of our nation”. Progressives may balk at such language, which is at odds with a more egalitarian, inclusive and internationalist conception of what art is for and about. But we can still be glad that the plays, music, museum collections and public spaces that we value are recognised by the government as being among our most precious national treasures – not least because they have the power to bring us together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/06/the-guardian-view-on-15bn-for-the-arts-the-shows-will-go-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Helping grieving relatives reach a difficult decision without hectoring or judging is a fine art</p><p>“What kind of God would do this?” she sobs and rocks. I am sinking in my chair and the nurse is perched on the side table. To focus on something other than her palpable despair, I regard the worn sofa and imagine a public hospital meeting room with comfort and sunlight. When a daughter arrives, she squeezes in beside her grieving mother.</p><p>She is a woman plainly devoted to God and her children, especially the unmarried daughter who is now my patient. The second daughter strikes me as thoughtful and educated, and as becomes evident, helpless to stem the tide of her mother’s sorrow. I fret at this, not because I am rushed, rather the patient needs an urgent outcome.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/commentisfree/2020/jul/07/a-difficult-conversation-with-her-family-led-to-a-better-death-for-my-patient">Continue reading...</a>

No wonder we can’t handle it</p><p>The least-helpful piece of advice in the world is: “Just be yourself.” (Seriously? It won’t go well.) The second-least-helpful is: “Just act normal.” I have been acting normal sitting on a train in a mask and gloves, while my glasses misted up, telling myself: “This is just fine.” Then I acted normally by sitting in the drizzle outside a pub with a young man desperate for his first pint of Guinness in a while, only to be told by frazzled bar staff that they had no Guinness. Then I acted normally in another small town and had a drink outside! Until I got up to go to the loo, and my mate stopped me. “Don’t go in there,” she said ominously. “I have a bad feeling about it.”</p><p>In a world in which we’re all “acting normal”, we shouldn’t have all these bad feelings, should we? But they won’t go away. We are now required to make snap judgments about what is safe and what isn’t because, actually, we don’t really know.

<p>Toxic masculinity is built into the fabric of our urban spaces, writes Leslie Kern, author of new book Feminist City. And the results aren’t just divisive – they can be lethal</p><p>Glass ceilings and phallic towers. Mean streets and dark alleys. Road names and statues of men. From the physical to the metaphorical, the city is filled with reminders of masculine power. And yet we rarely talk of the urban landscape as an active participant in gender inequality. A building, no matter how phallic, isn’t actually misogynist, is it? Surely a skyscraper isn’t responsible for sexual harassment, the wage gap, or even the glass ceiling, whether it has a literal one up top or not?</p><p>That said, our built environments can still reflect patterns of gender-based discrimination. To imagine the city and its structures as neutral places where complicated human social relations are staged is to ignore the simple fact that <em>people</em> built these places. As the feminist geographer Jane Darke has said: “Our cities are patriarchy written in stone, brick, glass and concrete.” In other words, cities reflect the norms of the societies that build them. And sexism is a deep-rooted norm.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/06/upward-thrusting-buildings-ejaculating-cities-sexist-leslie-kern-phallic-feminist-city-toxic-masculinity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From idiosyncratic Italian pop to experimental funk and moments from his classic westerns, here are some of the maestro’s most striking moments</p><p>Trying to sum up the maestro’s 66-year career into ten tracks is impossible. His work was simply too diverse to be comprehensively boiled down into a neat list. His film scores alone spanned jazz, lushly romantic orchestrations, supremely freaked-out psychedelic rock and all points in between; outside of cinema, he worked in everything from 60s Europop to avant-garde modern classical; in rock and pop, his influence is the thread that binds artists as disparate as Metallica, Gnarls Barkley, Alex Turner and Adam and the Ants.

<p>Check in at The Dixon near Tower Bridge … where staff are doing all they can to provide a bit of pampering while social distancing and keeping guests safe</p><p>‘I’m afraid I can’t take your bags,” says the manager of The Dixon, a boutique hotel just south of Tower Bridge. He greets me in the lobby on reopening day (Saturday 4 July) after the pandemic forced the hotel to close for four months. A smile beams from behind the clear plastic visor that covers his face. “We have a new procedure, you see.”</p><p>That procedure goes like this: when guests arrive they are directed to a non-contact temperature scanner and hand-sanitiser station. If a guest’s temperature is below 38C, they can proceed to reception where a masked clerk checks them in from behind a plastic screen. There, guests are offered a face covering and talked through the changes. Namely, that the gym is closed; there is no breakfast buffet (guests need to preorder); that social distancing must be maintained; and that should you need help with your luggage, you are to leave it with staff, who’ll sanitise it using a fogger machine before dropping it to your room.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/06/first-post-lockdown-stay-london-hotel-the-dixon-tower-bridge">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As an aparthotel, the Native is well set up for social distancing, but is Manchester’s wider Northern Quarter as welcoming?</p><p>Well this feels strange, doesn’t it? Leaving the house. With plans. Being able to sleep in a hotel room and sink a pint on Saturday night. But only, in my case, after sitting masked on an eerily empty tram as it trundles past the Nightingale Hospital North West, a reminder of how precarious England’s rush into the new normal might be.</p><p>If travelling into Manchester city centre from its suburbs feels unreal, imagine the leap of faith it would require to book a city-break right now. Yet, at the 166-room Native aparthotel, 60 rooms sold late last week to … someone. Its public ground floor – previously bar, restaurant, cinema and Cultureplex arts space, now Ducie Street Warehouse – is reasonably busy with a glammed-up and self-consciously hip Northern Quarter crowd. None older than 32. Does the world now belong to health-confident 20-somethings? Possibly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/06/what-happens-when-a-bloke-hops-into-the-lift-with-you-post-lockdown-in-a-manchester-hotel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A three-bean salad is perfect throw-together summer fare, and it will keep long enough for people to linger over to the picnic table</p><p>And suddenly it is summer. Normally I spend weeks standing on the shoreline of the hottest season, reluctant to change my clothes, habits or the arrangement of things. And then, when I do, I am the person shuffling in, a bare toe here or shaved leg there, wiping six months of dust from the outside chairs and pulling the thermal bag from under the bed, looking at a dress. It is usually early July by the time I locate my sunglasses, or simply give up looking and buy another pair.</p><p>But this year, encouraged by my friend Alice and her suggestion of socially distanced time at the sea just north of Rome, I flung myself into the hottest season. We were like pale limbs just out of plaster, or animals blinking on their exit from a dark hibernation cave. After months contained in small spaces in a sleeping city, there was no time to hover over anything – clothes, inhibition, the shoreline – we were in, submerged in the inky cool of the Tyrrhenian sea, flapping and flailing like liberated animals, our skin on cold fire. Cold currents dance and tug in the stretch of coast between <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2019/mar/18/castello-santa-sever-rome-hostel-castle-beach-italy">Santa Severa</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/blog/2012/jun/07/rome-beach-santa-marinella-restaurant">Santa Marinella</a>, and on good days a land breeze blows the water clear enough to see the pebbles wink and sea urchins spike from the seabed. Out of the sea we lay ourselves out on the hot pebbles to dry, bubbles of families under umbrellas dotted the beach doing much the same thing, the unselfconscious ease of a free pebble beach even more apparent after <em>quarantena</em>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/06/rachel-roddy-three-bean-salad-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beginning a new series celebrating 20 iconic festival sets across history while 2020’s festival season is cancelled, we go back to Beyoncé’s superhuman desert session</p><p>If Beyoncé’s fanbase, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/aug/10/meaning-beyonce-dispatch-inside-the-beyhive">Beyhive</a>, is something of a cult, then her live performances are their holy pilgrimage. Although I had been on three previously, in Boston, Amsterdam and London, I felt relieved when she had to cancel her Coachella performances in 2017 due to her pregnancy – there was no way I could afford to get myself to Los Angeles, let alone buy a ticket.</p><p>Fellow Beyhivers half-joke that her shows are like going to church, and by the time of her rescheduled Coachella date in 2018 – becoming the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/apr/15/beyonce-at-coachella-review-greatest-star-of-her-generation-writes-herself-into-history">first black woman to headline the festival</a> – it felt like the return of the messiah. By some divine miracle, a friend who had an artist performing at Coachella added me to their entourage as a “backing dancer”. The desert air was cool, but there was a hot rising giddiness in the crowd, mixed with musky clouds that some were exhaling. The festival’s proximity to LA’s celebrity bubble gives it a glittery, superficial vibe; everyone thinks they are a star or can at least buy their way into the VIP area. But even the most faux-nonchalant influencer was having their chill eroded by anticipation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/06/beyonce-coachella-2017-a-rich-tapestry-of-black-cultural-excellence">Continue reading...</a>

It would be a long-lived ostrich, one residing with you inside your home for at least eighteen years.&nbsp;</p><p>This large, growing bird would require a great deal of care – daily, exhausting, heroic care, for which you wouldn’t be paid, nor, in general, well supported. In fact, you’d probably have to take time off from work; if you’re a woman, your ability to earn a post-ostrich livelihood would most likely be curtailed, perhaps severely. Plus, there would be the expense of ostrich daycare, ostrich violin lessons; in the future, god help you, ostrich college. Did you catch the part where you’re physically birthing the ostrich? It would tear open your body as it emerged from either between your legs or a gash sliced across your stomach, this larger-than-usual, speckled ostrich egg.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/06/more-women-like-me-are-choosing-to-be-childfree-is-this-the-age-of-opting-out">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Pandemic accelerates developments in sustainability from businesses and consumers</p><p>The queues were “absolutely crazy”, says Gavin Hudson, the owner of the cycle repair startup Butternut Bikes. As lockdown descended he began fixing old bikes in the parking lot of a Methodist church in north London, before moving his services to a furloughed pub in Crouch End. However, the surge in demand for cycle repairs meant the pop-up was soon able to afford a permanent address.</p><p>“Some people come in and tell us they haven’t been on a bike in 10 years,” Hudson says. “They are dragging all kinds of bikes, covered in cobwebs, out from the shed to get back on the roads. It’s great. I think it’s really true that there are few problems in society today that can’t be made better by getting people walking and cycling more.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/06/from-dusted-off-bikes-to-electric-dreams-uk-green-economy-booms-on-back-of-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>
