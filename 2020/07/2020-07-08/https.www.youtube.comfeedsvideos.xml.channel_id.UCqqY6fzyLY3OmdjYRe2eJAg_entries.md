LYRICS
you were slowly moving out of sight
we've been lost calling it a night 
if only you could see me now
trying to make it through it all somehow
 
i remember it all like yesterday
looking back, you won't fade away
i know it won't be like the start
just been wondering when you changed your heart
 
so come back 
and give me a sign of your love
come back
and give me a sign of your love
 
so come back 
and give me a sign of your love
come back
and give me a sign of your love
 
so come back 
and give me a sign of your love
come back
and give me a sign of your love
 
you were slowly moving out of sight
we've been lost calling it a night
