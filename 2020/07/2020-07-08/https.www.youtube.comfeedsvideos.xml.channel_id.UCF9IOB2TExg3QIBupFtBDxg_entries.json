Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 (Clinical Infectious Disease, 6 July)\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798\n\n239 scientists support this Commentary \n\nPotential for airborne spread of COVID-19\n\nSignificant potential for inhalation exposure\n\nMicroscopic respiratory droplets (microdroplets)\n\nViruses are released during exhalation, talking, and coughing in microdroplets\n\nSmall enough to remain aloft in air\n\n5 \u03bcm droplet will travel tens of meters\n\nTransmission via airborne microdroplets is an important pathway\n\nHand washing and social distancing are appropriate, but insufficient\n\nViruses have been shown to survive equally well, if not better, in aerosols compared to droplets on a surface\n\nSeveral superspreading events\n\nWe must address every potentially important pathway to slow the spread of COVID-19\n\nMeasures that should be taken\n\nProvide sufficient and effective ventilation (supply clean outdoor air, minimize recirculating air) particularly in public buildings, workplace environments, schools, hospitals, and aged care homes. \n\nSupplement general ventilation with airborne infection controls such as local exhaust, high efficiency air filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet lights. \n\nAvoid overcrowding, particularly in public transport and public buildings. \n\nWHO response\n\nhttps://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200326-sitrep-66-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=81b94e61_2\n\nTransmission through smaller droplet nuclei (airborne transmission) that propagate through air at distances longer than 1 meter is limited to aerosol generating procedures during clinical care of COVID-19 patients. \n\nIn all other contexts, available evidence indicates that COVID-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites.\n\nWHO continues to recommend\n\nEveryone performs hand hygiene frequently\n\nFollows respiratory etiquette\n\nRegularly clean and disinfect surfaces\n\nMaintaining physical distances\n\nAvoiding people with fever or respiratory symptoms\n\nThese preventive measures will limit viral transmission\n\nWHO, However\n\nWe are also looking at the possible role of airborne transmission in other settings\n\nWe will be releasing our brief in the coming days\n\nWe acknowledge there is emerging evidence in this field\n\nTherefore, we believe we have to be open to this evidence and its implications\n\nDetermining the dose of the virus required for airborne transmission\n\nThese fields of research are really growing but not definitive\n\nThe possibility of airborne transmission in public settings \u2014 especially closed, poorly ventilated settings \u2014 cannot be ruled out\n\nImportance of removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjuaPuiqYnA", "date_published":
