Another Pandemic from China? No

Bubonic Plague

https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/plague/en/

https://www.cdc.gov/plague/faq/index.html

What is plague?

Rodents and humans

2-6 day incubation

50 – 60% fatality

Yersinia pestis bacteria

How it spreads
Person gets bitten by a flea that is infected

Direct contact with infected tissues or fluids, before or after death

Inhaling respiratory droplets after close contact with cats and humans with pneumonic plague

Presentations

Bubonic plague (infected flee bits)

Sudden onset of fever

Headache

Chills

Weakness

One or more swollen, tender and painful lymph nodes (called buboes)

Septicemic plague, (bites of infected fleas, handling an infected animal)

Shock

Bleeding into the skin and other organs

Skin and other tissues may turn black and die, especially on fingers, toes, and the nose

Pneumonic plague (inhaling infectious droplets from infected people)

Rapidly developing pneumonia

Shortness of breath

Chest pain 

Cough

CDC
7 cases per year in the UK

History

Yersinia pestis, finds from the Late Bronze Age 

524 Plague of Justinian

1348 black death

1665 great plague of London

Third pandemic, 1850s to 1904

It is Time to Address Airborne Transmission of COVID-19 (Clinical Infectious Disease, 6 July)

https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa939/5867798

239 scientists support this Commentary 

Potential for airborne spread of COVID-19

Significant potential for inhalation exposure

Microscopic respiratory droplets (microdroplets)

Viruses are released during exhalation, talking, and coughing in microdroplets

Small enough to remain aloft in air

5 μm droplet will travel tens of meters

Transmission via airborne microdroplets is an important pathway

Hand washing and social distancing are appropriate, but insufficient

Viruses have been shown to survive equally well, if not better, in aerosols compared to droplets on a surface

Several superspreading events

We must address every potentially important pathway to slow the spread of COVID-19

Measures that should be taken

Provide sufficient and effective ventilation (supply clean outdoor air, minimize recirculating air) particularly in public buildings, workplace environments, schools, hospitals, and aged care homes. 

Supplement general ventilation with airborne infection controls such as local exhaust, high efficiency air filtration, and germicidal ultraviolet lights. 

Avoid overcrowding, particularly in public transport and public buildings. 

WHO response

https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200326-sitrep-66-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=81b94e61_2

Transmission through smaller droplet nuclei (airborne transmission) that propagate through air at distances longer than 1 meter is limited to aerosol generating procedures during clinical care of COVID-19 patients. 

In all other contexts, available evidence indicates that COVID-19 virus is transmitted during close contact through respiratory droplets (such as coughing) and by fomites.

WHO continues to recommend

Everyone performs hand hygiene frequently

Follows respiratory etiquette

Regularly clean and disinfect surfaces

Maintaining physical distances

Avoiding people with fever or respiratory symptoms

These preventive measures will limit viral transmission

WHO, However

We are also looking at the possible role of airborne transmission in other settings

We will be releasing our brief in the coming days

We acknowledge there is emerging evidence in this field

Therefore, we believe we have to be open to this evidence and its implications

Determining the dose of the virus required for airborne transmission

These fields of research are really growing but not definitive

The possibility of airborne transmission in public settings — especially closed, poorly ventilated settings — cannot be ruled out

Importance of removal of the virus-laden droplets from indoor air by ventilation

Face covering

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-53316491

Late April

UK, 25%

Italy, 83.4% 

United States, 65.8%

Spain, 63.8%

Royal Society, Prof Ramakrishnan

Public remained sceptical about their benefits

The message has not been clear enough

Guidelines have been inconsistent. 

‘What we would like for the government is to be a bit stronger and clearer about the messaging and require it whenever you are in crowded public spaces where you cannot get more than two metres away from the next person’

‘anti-social’

Public transport and hospitals

Scotland, mandatory on public transport, shops from 10 July

World Health Organization, advised since June

Evidence that they protected other people was ‘clearer all the time’


‘Some evidence’ they protected the wearer

‘There are people without symptoms going about their daily business who are unknowingly breathing out droplets that are carrying the virus’

‘If they had their faces covered the majority of those droplets would be caught before they can infect other people 

Wearing face coverings can help save lives and prevent disabling illnesses’

2) IgG (the aGglutinating antibody) 

3) IgA (from sAliva, sweAt and teArs)
