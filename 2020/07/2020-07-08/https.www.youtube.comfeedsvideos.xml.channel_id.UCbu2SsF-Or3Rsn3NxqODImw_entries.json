The movie is slated for a July 2021 release, but it's easy to assume it'll get delayed due to COVID. Speaking of delays, the next installment in the Dark Pictures anthology games, Little Hope, was pushed back to October 30, 2020. News of the delay came with the announcement of new pre-order details including three different versions.\n\nHere's an interview that Kurt Indovina did with the game's actor Will Poulter: https://youtu.be/mqnIxbAYrNU\n\nWorld of Warcraft's next expansion, Shadowlands, gets lots of new details, including a look into the game's new dungeons, covenant system, and more. There's still no release date for the expansion, but it'll be going into beta very soon.\n\nMeanwhile, Play For All keeps on trucking.

In this video we go through some of the funniest spoiler-free moments in the early game.\n\nNintendo games have never shied away from being funny, including recent examples like Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but in a lot of ways humor defines the Paper Mario series. Enemies will talk to Mario like they\u2019re both people living their lives and doing what they need to do. Some enemies are even fans of Mario and let him know as much. \n\nOne of the new characters introduced in The Origami King, Olivia, is very bright and cheerful but can sometimes be a bit clueless, which adds to her charm and makes for some funny banter between her and other characters. This video does not contain any spoilers for the game and focuses primarily on the earlier sections with banter between characters.\n\nPaper Mario: The Origami King will be released for Nintendo Switch on July 17, 2020.

The update will be live at 10 AM PST / 1 PM EST and will also include changes to the game's battle pass: you will be able to select rewards instead of earning them at certain tiers. With Halo 3 on the PC roster, this just leaves Halo 3: ODST and Halo 4 to join the collection at a later date. The full series is available on the Master Chief Collection on Xbox One. \n\nPersia also goes over 2K Games' recent announcement that Mafia: Definite Edition has been delayed. The release date has been shifted from August 28 to September 25, after complications due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Developer Hangar 13 and 2K want to ensure the quality of the remaster by delaying the game but promised to show off gameplay on July 23 to hold fans over for the extra month.\n\nLastly, Persia talks about a new job listing from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games, which suggests a new 3D title may be in production. Yacht Club is known for retro-style, 2D games like the upcoming Shovel Knight Dig and Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon. We don't currently know anything about this 3D title, but the listing also mentions the use of a custom engine.\n\nWe are in the final week of #PlayForAll, where we've been bringing you all of the news and action this summer has to offer while raising money for #BlackLivesMatter and COVID-19 relief efforts.
