The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 9, 2020 | Colin Marshall -- Polymath musician Jacob Collier has been championing this style of one-man-band music videos since 2012, singing every note and playing every instrument. His cover of Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing"earned him a devout YouTube following at the age of 19, and he hasn't slowed down since. The London wunderkind owns four Grammy Awards already, including two at the age of 22 in 2017, and his evolution as a bandleader has been evident in his live performances ( like when he came to NPR for a Tiny Desk concert last year). Now 25, and with nearly a decade of experience producing every aspect of his own music from his home, Collier is uniquely positioned to crank out his best work from quarantine. In this video, each of the four parts was recorded in a single take. Pay close attention ; it's easy to get tripped up inside Jacob's head as he arranges this Rubik's Cube of a video production, which feels both like a magic trick and a no-strings-attached bedroom session.

Since the pandemic hit hard in March, Collier has been hustling in his Internet-famous room. He's played duets over Instagram Live with the likes of Chris Martin, JoJo and Daniel Caesar, recorded a song in his bathroom, and he's in the middle of releasing his ambitious four-volume record, Djesse. The last song in this video is the premiere of his new single "He Won't Hold You," which will appear on Vol. 3, due out later this year.

SET LIST
"All I Need"
"Time Alone With You"
"He Won't Hold You"

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 8, 2020 | Bobby Carter - This was slated to be Roddy Ricch's summer. He was having the breakout moment that I've seen from so many other Compton emcees before him. The young man born Rodrick Moore Jr. snagged his first Grammy. He had multiple hit songs on the radio, including the biggest song in the world in "The Box," which spent 11 weeks at the top of Billboard's Hot 100 and will probably go down as the last pre-COVID club anthem. His live show refuted any doubts of his true musicianship and he was primed to touch every festival stage this season. No one could have anticipated in December how prophetic his debut album title — Please Excuse Me for Being Antisocial — would be.

Roddy was originally booked to play the Tiny Desk in June, but once the cancellation of festival season was fully realized, he and his team began mapping out something special for our home series. He flexes his range from the beginning, playing a keyboard atop a desk at famed auto garage West Coast Customs in California. Backed by the juggernaut musical collective 1500 or Nothin', this set exhibits the many dimensions of Please Excuse Me..., from "Bacc Seat" (featuring an appearance from Ty Dolla $ign) to the stunning rework of "War Baby." Many factors have contributed to the dissolution of a 'normal' summer in 2020, but Roddy Ricch is determined to prove that it's still his time to shine.

SET LIST
"Perfect Time"
"Bacc Seat" (feat. Ty Dolla $ign)
"High Fashion"
"War Baby"

MUSICIANS
Roddy Ricch: vocals, keys; Lamar Edwards: keys; Charles "Uncle Chucc" Hamilton: guitar; Christopher "Brody" Brown: bass; Larrance Dopson: percussion; Nick Smith: drums, Ty Dolla $ign: vocals, guitar; Shaunise R. Harris: vocals; Garren Edwards: vocals; Tayler L. Green: vocals
