You’re an idealist that wants to change the world. You view the world as corrupt and oppressive. You want to prevent the plebeian masses from stripping you down, we have to learn how to communicate the change we want in a way that actually gets through to people’s thick heads. 

Revolutions are just a part of human civilization. It is a change from whatever the status quo was at the time. For example, Elon Musk is the main revolutionary of the ideology that humans should be an interplanetary species. The core of it all, is the never-ending power struggle.

The Haves sit at the top of the hierarchy, they have most of the resources, and are the smallest in number.

The Have-nots are the largest in number at the very bottom of the hierarchy. They resent the Haves. They hate the upper class’s legal system, their police, their opulence. And because they’re already at the lowest of the low, once that flame starts, the only direction they can go is up.

And then there’s the Have-a-Little, Want Some More crowd - AKA the Middle Class. Stuck right in the middle. This makes the Middle Class have sort-of a split personality: to revolution, or to not revolution. Most of the Middle Class are Do-Nothings. But in reality - they’re not gonna do much, and will typically choose the safe route to make sure they come out on top.

Every single revolution can be traced back to these three classes: The Haves have the power, the Have-Nots become resentful of their power. The resentment simmers over time until boom. Until the revolutionaries slowly morph into the system they once condemned. So is the tragedy of human civilization.

Before you tearing down the system, treat your revolution like a movie. Set the stage, present the problem, distinguish the good and bad guys. Your real job is to change the public’s mind first, make them feel disgusted and enslaved by the system and your revolution will take care of itself.

Revolutions start with an ideology and your job is to nurture and infect the ideology of your choosing into as many people as possible. Pick your ideology and spread your gospel. One insanely effective tactic you can use is the Angry Mob. Now you may be saying to yourself It does take a lot of wok. You may be wondering what the purpose of all this is. But what is life without a greater purpose that’s bigger than yourself to fight for? That’s a life not worth living.
