<p>Nando Parrado, the 150-1 Coventry Stakes winner, takes his name from a survivor of the Andes plane crash of 1972</p><p>The original Nando Parrado is said to be “thrilled” by the recent success of his namesake at Royal Ascot, where the colt in question was a shock winner of the Coventry Stakes at odds of 150-1. Parrado, one of the survivors of the 1972 plane crash in the Andes whose story was told in the 1993 movie Alive, had given his consent for the horse to be named after him.</p><p>The two-year-old’s trainer, Clive Cox, was asked on Wednesday whether Parrado knew of the success of the horse, who is now quoted in betting lists for next year’s 2,000 Guineas. “He most certainly does,” Cox said. “I’ve not spoken to him directly but I know the owners have, Paul and Marie McCarten. He’s thrilled he’s got such a high-profile horse competing with his name.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jul/09/talking-horses-crash-hero-thrilled-to-have-ascot-winner-named-after-him">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This clever drama sees the actor portray Phyllis Schlafly – who led a 70s campaign against equal rights in the US – without turning her into a simple villain</p><p>Mrs America (BBC Two) will either kill or cure you. On the one hand, this miniseries about the fight between reactionary author and activist Phyllis Schlafly and the great and good of second-wave feminism will evoke a time when optimism infused the land and progress seemed unstoppable. On the other hand, it reminds us that Schlafly stopped such progress.</p><p>An oversimplification, obviously, but this basic duality runs through the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08ggcmd">nine-part drama</a> and hits the fragile 2020 psyche harder, perhaps, than its makers ever planned. Mrs America – the first concentrated account of Schlafly’s story on screen, I think, and certainly in recent times – shows just how, and why, she managed to mobilise an army of fellow homemakers across the nation against the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA, which is still unpassed 50 years on), a piece of legislation that would have offered women protection from discrimination. That it manages to do so without making her either villainous or venal is testimony to the sophistication of the script (at least once it gets past its early, exposition-heavy stages) and the production’s intent. Like its spiritual predecessor Mad Men (one of whose writers, Dahvi Waller, created this series), its heart lies in showing how we got from there to here, rather than praising or damning individuals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/08/mrs-america-review-cate-blanchett-fights-off-feminism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The chancellor is handing out cocktail umbrellas as the UK heads into a hurricane</p><p>Almost alone among his cabinet colleagues, Rishi Sunak has a knack for saying the right thing at the right time. He did it again on Wednesday while unveiling his plan for jobs. “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/a-plan-for-jobs-speech" title="">We entered this crisis unencumbered by dogma</a>,” the chancellor told fellow MPs. “And we continue in this spirit, driven always by the simple desire to do what is right.” Fine words uttered in a sympathetic tone. The trouble is, they are not matched by actions. The former investment banker, who can see that the UK is entering a historic economic and social crisis, is grappling with the ambitious politician who doesn’t want to scare Conservative backbenchers. What emerges from this unhappy struggle is the strange alloy offered on Wednesday: sound analysis, sensible priorities but underwhelming, sometimes even wrongheaded policies.</p><p>Where Mr Sunak is correct is that this recession is unlike any the UK has faced in decades. In order to contain a lethal virus, almost all of the real-world private sector has had to freeze in its tracks. <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/speech/2020/andy-haldane-the-second-quarter-webinar" title="">Spending on restaurants, travel and entertainment has fallen by as much as 80%</a>. The public sector has had to spend unprecedented sums where businesses and households cannot, covering the wages for 9 million jobs, underwriting loans to firms, and funding apprenticeships. Costing £160bn since March alone, this is hugely expensive but essential. The chancellor has sensibly ignored the backbenchers calling on him to lay out plans for spending cuts in the future. To do so now would be to damage business and consumer confidence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/08/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunak-right-words-right-focus-wrong-policies">Continue reading...</a>

A rustle and a whimper come from the room that adjoins our bedroom.

She’s awake and now being very loud and shouty about it.</p><p>I bring her over to the bed and find some family videos on my phone for her to watch while I come to terms with the fact I’ll have to get up having had less than five hours of sleep. Luckily she is easily pleased and videos of her running around patting her “mi ma melly” (big fat belly), and playing peek-a-boo when she’s supposed to be sleeping, keep her occupied for another blissful 10 minutes. She’s not yet two years old and smartphones are already part of her world – for entertainment, as well as being a source of frustration when she wants her parents’ attention.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/jul/08/when-is-the-right-time-to-let-your-child-have-their-first-phone">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This ‘kronans kaka’ is made with potato for a gluten-free sweet treat</p><p>Potatoes are a great way of adding structure and moisture to a cake. They have been used in Swedish baking for centuries and a recipe for kronans kaka (crown cake) was first published in 1903. Cakes made with potato are moist due to the starch but can be rather dense. This version of a kronans kaka is light and delicate – more like a frangipane. It is the perfect dessert for people looking for a gluten-free treat. Adding potato enables you to remove some fat and provides resistant starch and nutrients such as potassium and vitamin C. If you want to make these cakes extra-decadent, spoon over a tablespoon of amaretto once baked and serve with yogurt and jam.</p><p><em>Makes 10 mini-cakes</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/08/david-athertons-recipe-for-kronans-kaka">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sunday lunch and an overnight stay at the Cow in Dalbury Lees is a joy after months of home cooking – even if it means hand-sanitiser, QR codes and no propping up the bar</p><p>We are practically exploding with excitement at the thought of going to a pub as we arrive at the Cow, though our anticipation has been muted slightly by pictures of heedless city-centre crowds on the first night of reopening. Inside this revamped Derbyshire dales inn, though, all is calm. My husband and I squirt on hand-sanitiser from a dispenser inside the door but beyond that it all feels pretty much like a normal Sunday.</p><p>In late afternoon there’s a muted hum of voices as people linger over roast dinners. A barman smiles from behind the beer pumps and a waitress is handing out plates of treacle tart. But signs that this is actually “new normal” are there when you look closely. The tables are widely spaced, and there’s no knot of locals propping up the bar – even the bar stools have been removed. (Drinks ordered at the bar are served at your table; anyone who really wants to drink standing up does so outside.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/08/will-breakfast-buffet-ever-return-post-lockdown-break-derbyshire-dales-the-cow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From London to Llandudno to Dundee, museums are back in business. So is it now safe to view art – and how will they cope with the drastic drop in numbers?<br /></p><p>‘There was a moment,” says Andrew Nairne, “when I was thinking, of course, we are like Nottingham Contemporary and the Hepworth Wakefield, places like that.” The director of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2018/feb/02/kettles-yard-cambridge-actions-review">Kettle’s Yard in Cambridge</a> is guiding me around a gallery that’s “in rehearsals” for a socially distanced opening in August. “Then I remembered that the others don’t have a little cottage with tiny rooms and narrow corridors.”</p><p>Today, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/06/the-national-gallery-reopens-adrian-searle">National Gallery in London is reopening</a> after Covid-19 abruptly shut the doors of British museums in mid-March. But Kettle’s Yard, like many others, is taking a slower, phased approach. The institution regularly hosts shows in its new, airy galleries – an exhibition from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/18/linder-post-punk-artist-retrospective-at-kettles-yard">the artist Linder</a> will be extended into the autumn – but at its heart is the home of its founder, curator and collector Jim Ede. This takes the form of a series of knocked-through cottages, their awkward-shaped rooms brimming with art and delicate objects. It is meant to be a warm, hospitable place where visitors are allowed the freedom to sit in armchairs, leaf through books left out on tables, and generally feel at home. All of which also makes it a social-distancing nightmare.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/08/great-reopening-britains-galleries-covid-proofed-london-dundee-llandudno">Continue reading...</a>
