Yet he is one of the most questioning, intelligent political dramatists Britain has ever produced. Why does no one revive The Party (1973) which marked Olivier\u2019s farewell to the stage? Why does the BBC, as we celebrate the NHS, not reshow Griffiths\u2019 TV play about Aneurin Bevan, Food for Ravens (1997)? Above all \u2013 assuming theatre ever returns to something like normality \u2013 how about re-examining Occupations, which is a genuine modern classic?</p><p>First seen at the Manchester Stables in 1970, Occupations was given a superb Buzz Goodbody production, starring Patrick Stewart and Ben Kingsley, the following year by the RSC. Like a lot of Griffiths\u2019 early work, the play was a response to the failure of the 1968 revolution in France. But, rather than deal directly with recent events, Griffiths finds what he calls a \u201chistorical correlative\u201d in the abortive socialist uprising in Italy in 1920. We see Christo Kabak, a Bulgarian communist and representative of the Third International, arriving in Turin to await, and even influence, political events.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/06/forgotten-plays-no-6-occupations-1970-by-trevor-griffiths\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/06/forgotten-plays-no-6-occupations-1970-by-trevor-griffiths", "date_published": "2020-07-05 23:01:57+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Chancellor under pressure to boost financial support as job crisis looms", "description": "<p>Hospitality leaders urge Rishi Sunak to act as figures reveal high streets are still struggling</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is coming under growing pressure to unleash more financial support to stop Britain plunging into the worst jobs crisis for a generation, as figures showed high streets remained quiet on Saturday despite the easing of lockdown measures in some parts of the country.</p><p>Although pubs, restaurants and hairdressers were allowed to open across England for the first time since March, industry data show that visits to town and city centres on Saturday were down by more than half compared with a year ago.

gleefully send themselves up in this one-off mockumentary \u2013 though it\u2019s never as funny when celebrities are in on the joke</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t stitch us up to look like a pair of knobs,\u201d Martin Kemp orders the producer at the start of this mockumentary (BBC Two). \u201cYou\u2019re not filming this, are you?\u201d Of course not, lies the producer.<br /><br />Since Christmas 2018, when the BBC\u2019s fly-on-the-wall documentary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/29/welcome-rebirth-for-bros-the-brothers-pop-forgot\">Bros: After the Screaming Stops</a> was an unexpected hit, the hunt has been on for another couple of \u2013 no offence \u2013 has-been siblings to do up like kippers. <br /><br />Surely there must be another pair of fraternally challenged, guileless rubes out there who, like the 80s pop idols Matt and Luke Goss, are vain and dim enough to let the cameras poke around their embarrassing lifestyles and explore their \u2013 no offence \u2013 jejune world views? Kate and her sister Pippa Middleton, say. Luke and Chris Hemsworth benching each other naked while deconstructing Norse myths?<br /><br />Presumably the Hemsworths and Middletons were not available. Hence the Kemps, and a PR-friendly mockumentary, rather than a documentary in which they wouldn\u2019t be in on the gag.<br /><br />Younger readers may not have heard of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/02/martin-and-gary-kemp-most-brothers-in-music-seem-to-hate-each-other\">Martin and Gary Kemp</a>. In the 70s, Gary, with his brother, formed the post-punk preeners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/mar/25/spandau-ballet-thatcherism\">Spandau Ballet</a>, whose name evoked the prison where Rudolf Hess, Hitler\u2019s deputy, was jailed and whose Top of the Pops outfits distracted us from noticing what Margaret Thatcher was doing to Britain.<br /><br />They sported blow-dried mullets, guitars strapped so high they risked rubbing their nipples red raw, white singlets, over-the-shoulder tartan car rugs cinched at the waist and military-style plus fours. Only because the Kemps were gorgeous could they get away with looking so daft \u2013 they were men\u2019s belated answer to Marilyn Monroe in a potato sack. <br /><br />Martin was in EastEnders, too, and the pair played the Kray twins in the 1990 biopic of the East End gangsters.<br /><br />Fast-forward nearly four decades and they have let in the cameras to capture the making of an album of the band\u2019s hits covered by 21st-century stars. But that is only one of the creatively null projects that these fading celebs are responsible for in their dotage. They have also set up a retirement facility for old rockers called Now That\u2019s What I Call a Rest Home, which, sadly, has been overrun by voles. Gary talks only about his woeful painting and his charity work.<br /><br />The problem with the Kemps here was that, unlike the Goss bros, they had the last laugh. Too much celebrity culture is like this. One yearns for a simpler time when, as in the Bros documentary, hubristic doughnuts make idiots of themselves unwittingly. I don\u2019t want celebrities gamely spoofing themselves \u2013 I want them destroy themselves on telly without realising it. <br /><br />When the Kemps feuded, their rows were scripted by others and, doubtless, copy-approved by the brothers. \u201cLose my number,\u201d snapped Gary after one faux falling out over creative direction. \u201cWhich one \u2013 your mobile, work or landline?\u201d snarled Martin. \u201cWork and mobile. I don\u2019t use my landline.\u201d \u201cFine!\u201d shouted Martin sarcastically before flouncing out.<br /><br />There were droll moments nonetheless. Gary and his ostensible wife, a kind of evil Linda McCartney played by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/aug/26/anna-maxwell-martin-ive-been-bullied-by-other-women-in-the-industry-in-fact-more-so-than-i-have-by-men-\">Anna Maxwell Martin</a>, were tackled on the Today programme by Nick Robinson over their range of vegan ready meals called Wodge, whose secret ingredient looked and tasted like meat. Why? Because it was.<br /><br />Then there was Martin\u2019s new movie project, provisionally titled The Hardest British Bastards of the Galaxy and, fingers crossed, so unremittingly butch and fatuously violent as to make Layer Cake seem like Steel Magnolias. Its premise was that Al Capone had \u2013 somehow \u2013 come back to life and was putting together a team from different historical eras to rob the crown jewels. The storyline, written by Martin, may have been fatuous tripe, but that didn\u2019t stop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating\">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a> being made.<br /><br />By the end of the programme, the Kemps had cleared their debts \u2013 caused by cryptocurrency losses \u2013 with a \u00a32m gig for a dictator\u2019s birthday. The dictator\u2019s new bride gave a creditable impersonation of the former Spandau frontman Tony Hadley singing that classic line from their hit True: \u201cListening to Marvin all night long / This is the sound of my soul.\u201d Which, it turned out, isn\u2019t about Lee Marvin, but someone called Marvin Gaye. Martin and Gary strummed obligingly from the sidelines, looking uncomfortable about implicitly endorsing her spouse\u2019s woeful human rights record.<br /><br />Who will launder their image with self-satire next? It is obvious. When the BBC makes Lockdown: The Road to Barnard Castle, Dominic Cummings must play, script and direct himself. Not only would the BBC save on Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s pay, it would gain a priceless ally in safeguarding the licence fee.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/05/the-kemps-all-true-review-a-gamely-spoof-for-this-droll-mockumentary\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/05/the-kemps-all-true-review-a-gamely-spoof-for-this-droll-mockumentary", "date_published": "2020-07-05 22:00:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Keith Gillespie reveals Ferguson role in four-fold pay rise at Newcastle", "description": "<ul><li>Scot acted as ad-hoc agent in transfer from Old Trafford</li><li>Gillespie was 19 and earning \u00a3230 a week before move</li></ul><p>Keith Gillespie has revealed how Sir Alex Ferguson secured him a four-fold pay-rise when the Scot acted as his ad-hoc agent in the \u00a37m deal that took the Northern Irishman from Manchester United to Newcastle United and Andy Cole the other way.</p><p>Gillespie made his United debut under Ferguson in 1993.
