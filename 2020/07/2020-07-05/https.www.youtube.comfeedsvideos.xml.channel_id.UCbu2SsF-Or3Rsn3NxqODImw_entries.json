For GameSpot's Play For All, we spoke to Colantonio--who is best known for his work on Prey and the Dishonored series--about Weird West and how his history as an experienced game developer makes working on a new game feel like a New Game Plus mode.\n\nIn the video above, Colantonio talks about how Weird West is inspired by early immersive sim games like System Shock, the original Fallout, and Ultima VII. Though Weird West begins as a traditional western-style story, the narrative quickly descends into the supernatural. These supernatural themes tie into the immersive sim mechanics.\n\nYou'll play as five different people in Weird West, but not all at once. Instead, you'll go from one hero to the next--like the baton in a relay race. This means that if the hero you're playing as is still alive by the time the story transitions to the next playable protagonist, you can meet the character you were previously playing as. You can even recruit the heroes you've already played as to your party.\n\nWeird West is set to release for PC in 2021 and may have a closed beta later this year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LvjG6qqhM", "date_published": "2020-07-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Blankos Block Party Is A User Generated Playground", "description": "Blankos Block Party is a colorful and intriguing-looking MMO party game of sorts that features a unique setup. The premise is that this game takes place in a world where vinyl toys come to life and have their own lives when humans aren't looking. \n\nAs part of GameSpot's gaming celebration Play For All, we caught up with Mythical Games chief creative officer Jamie Jackson who told us all about this imaginative project. In the video, Jackson talks about numerous aspects of the game, including its robust-looking level-editor that allows players to create basically anything they can imagine. \n\nBasically, Blankos Block Party seems to combine the free-flowing gameplay of titles like Fortnite and Roblox with the aesthetic charm of a Funko Pop vinyl toy come to life. A beta test for the game launches later this year, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more!", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSOOniJ2FPs", "date_published": "2020-07-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5: 30 Video Game Series We Want To See On The New Console", "description": "For the past 26 years, the PlayStation has produced some of gamings most memorable titles.
