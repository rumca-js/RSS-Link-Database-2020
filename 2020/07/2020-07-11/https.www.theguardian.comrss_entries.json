Despentes, whose inaugural notoriety was the spree-killing road novel <em>Baise-Moi</em> (she also directed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/may/03/culture.peterbradshaw\">the banned film adaptation</a>), appeared to have matured into a more expansive view of class, gender relations and power dynamics. <em>Vernon Subutex </em>looked as though it might become the kind of generational group portrait that Roberto Bola\u00f1o gave us of Mexican youth in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/roberto-bolano\">The Savage Detectives</a></em>.
