## Raheem Sterling stoops to conquer Brighton with Manchester City hat-trick

<p>On the horizon where beauty and sadism meet, Manchester City tore Brighton to ornate, sumptuous shreds. It was luxurious, it was cruel, it was pointless and yet in a strange way seemed to mean everything. Everyone knows that City’s biggest battles lie further afield: in the Champions League, and in the Lausanne courtroom where they will learn their fate on Monday. And here, with nothing tangible to play for in the league, City could simply play for the joy of playing, abetted by an opposition more than happy to let them do so.</p><p>Raheem Sterling bagged a hat-trick, Gabriel Jesus and Bernardo Silva added one each, but by then everyone was having too much fun to keep counting. For all the muted celebrations and multiple substitutions, giving the whole affair the feel of an international friendly against a small island nation with a precious vote on the Fifa executive committee, City’s intensity was irrepressible and irresistible. Perhaps, on reflection, this is the best way to enjoy Pep Guardiola’s baroque creation: no fans, no background noise, no forced narratives. Just football as its own lavish end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/11/brighton-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The celebrations were more memorable than the matches but Jack Charlton leaves an indelible mark on Irish football</p><p>Jack Charlton was to the Republic of Ireland what Pelé was to Brazil. He defined the national team to the world, establishing a style against which all of the country’s sides since have been measured for better or worse. Charlton, Ireland’s first foreign manager, even helped to alter society.</p><p>The beauty of a game depends on the beholder. For nearly 10 years Charlton’s Ireland were hard to watch and harrowing to play against, yet they gave unprecedented joy to millions. He was fortunate that during his reign Ireland had some of the greatest players in their history but it took an exceptional leader to rally them. The manager, a surprising appointment following a farcical selection process, brought a charisma and a clarity of vision that had been missing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/11/jack-charlton-republic-ireland-manager-exceptional-leader">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Older stars make the best subjects, and Carl Reiner will live on in my pantheon of greats</p><p>It was just by chance that I was the last person to interview comedy legend <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/feb/20/love-and-free-food-mel-brooks-and-carl-reiner-share-the-secrets-of-their-70-year-friendship" title="">Carl Reiner</a>, who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/30/carl-reiner-obituary" title="">died last week</a>, four months after I spent an evening with him and his best friend, Mel Brooks, at Reiner’s home in Beverly Hills. This was not my first final interview: I’m pretty sure I was the last journalist to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/membership/audio/2015/dec/31/burt-reynolds-meets-hadley-freeman-guardian-live-event" title="">interview Burt Reynolds</a>, and I was surely the last to interview <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/12/kirk-douglas-i-never-thought-id-live-to-100-thats-shocked-me" title="">Kirk Douglas</a>, 100 when I met him, in his home, just down the road from Reiner’s.</p><p>It’s possible there were more. It’s a professional peril if you prefer to interview the old rather than the young, as I do. Once a celebrity gets over 70, they shake off whatever shackles of propriety once contained them and really enjoy themselves.

<p>Flashes of vulgar energy and trademark cynicism enliven an overlong finale of ageing French rockers</p><p>When the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/02/vernon-subutex-1-by-virginie-despentes-review">first volume</a> in the punk-feminist writer Virginie Despentes’s Vernon Subutex<em> </em>trilogy appeared in English in 2015, it was a cause for excitement. Here was a big, brash, enjoyable slab of French recession fiction, a social novel full of ageing rockers and party-worn broads who drink cans of lager, DJ in scuzzy clubs and kip on their mates’ couches – the sort of crowd usually refused entry to Parisian literature. Despentes, whose inaugural notoriety was the spree-killing road novel <em>Baise-Moi</em> (she also directed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/may/03/culture.peterbradshaw">the banned film adaptation</a>), appeared to have matured into a more expansive view of class, gender relations and power dynamics. <em>Vernon Subutex </em>looked as though it might become the kind of generational group portrait that Roberto Bolaño gave us of Mexican youth in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/roberto-bolano">The Savage Detectives</a></em>. The question was whether Despentes, accustomed to snarling her truths over the fictive equivalent of three distorted power-chords, could sustain a project that, by the trilogy’s end, would amass 1,000 pages.</p><p>On reading the second volume, I had doubts. Despite the three-page index of main characters (<em>Vernon Subutex 3 </em>has one too, and I needed it throughout), Despentes kept introducing new ones, splitting off into intensity-draining subplots. The gig was in danger of becoming an interminable encore that no one wanted to hear. Still, there were bursts of entertainingly caustic social comment, and insights on contemporary Parisian life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/11/vernon-subutex-3-by-virginie-despentes-review-the-trilogy-concludes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With no commuting or pesky colleagues, working from home should be idyllic. So why are so many of us desperate to get back to our desks, asks Joe Moran</p><p>Ever since the arrival of broadband in the early 2000s, people have been predicting a revolution in homeworking. The revolution always felt oversold to me, too dismissive of our attachment to what cyberpunk writers and techno-utopians call “meatspace”. The number of homeworkers did rise, but they still had to endure tedious jokes about watching daytime TV and working in their pyjamas. Most people carried on going into work.</p><p>Then, in March, the future arrived with a bump, but in a very uneven way. Many workers still had to turn up for their essential and now hazardous jobs; others were furloughed or laid off. The rest of us had to tutor ourselves in video conferencing and data-sharing platforms. We got used to encountering our colleagues as rows and columns of heads and shoulders, like a very subdued game of <em>Celebrity Squares </em>with someone taking minutes. Meanwhile, ghostly reminders popped up on our email calendars, alerting us to work events arranged before lockdown. Somewhere in a parallel, pandemic-free universe, these events were being diligently attended by our alternative selves, people who had never heard of Zoom nor received an email telling them to “stay safe”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/11/out-of-office-has-the-homeworking-revolution-finally-arrived">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ben Affleck’s Finding the Way Back is the latest in US cinema’s rich tradition of basketball films, from Hoop Dreams to He Got Game</p><p>Having skidded far off the rails, a former star basketball player finds renewed purpose in life by coaching a team of bright-eyed young talents: some films start with a script, but <strong><a href="https://www.warnerbros.co.uk/movies/finding-way-back">Finding the Way Back</a></strong> practically starts with a template. That’s not a criticism of Gavin O’Connor’s satisfying meat-and-potatoes sports drama, which was supposed to come out in UK cinemas in late March, and instead was digitally released last Friday. <em>Finding the Way Back</em> uses the familiarity of its premise to highlight ways in which sporting triumph and personal pride don’t always line up.</p><p>As an alcoholic Los Angeles construction worker somehow tasked with coaching his former high school’s ailing basketball team, Ben Affleck introduces a note of wounded anxiety to proceedings that is never shed, even as the plot climbs its inevitable upward arc. Rescued from the purgatory of crummy Batman spinoffs, the embattled actor has clearly taken the film as his own metatextual comeback story, and sure enough, he’s the best he’s ever been in it. O’Connor knows his way around a worn, grainy study of everyday athletes – he previously made the excellent (<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/70141653">and Netflixable</a>) <strong>Warrior</strong> (2011) with Tom Hardy – and he brings similar integrity to this one.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/11/streaming-the-best-basketball-films">Continue reading...</a>

If you’ve found some of its previous foundations chalky and too pink (I have), then I urge you to wipe the slate clean. This is terrific, offering a sheer to medium coverage and an instantly pulled together, polished look with almost zero effort (everything here can be applied with fingertips or brush). Coconut milk gives the finish a moist dewiness I love, the shades are inclusive, and there’s bonus sun protection, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jul/11/the-best-easy-apply-foundations-for-a-remote-working-glow">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Growing our own potatoes is fun – but the pandemic and looming trade deals have exposed Britain’s fragile food security</p><p>Smugness is a well-documented side-effect of having an allotment, and at this time of year, with raspberries, gooseberries, currants, new potatoes and other goodies ripening and making it to the table, the condition becomes particularly acute. “Notice anything about these spuds?” I can’t help myself asking, faux-casually, over dinner. “And how about the chard? Particularly delicious, no?” To which the only acceptable answer, clearly, is a chorus of: “Oh yes, I noticed that immediately, I’ve never tasted such magnificent chard in my life.” (For some reason, this is not a response that comes naturally to my children.)</p><p>Many plot-holders will be even more insufferable this year, as we’ve had so much more time than usual to spend tending our plots. Allotments have been open throughout lockdown, designated as safe spaces for daily exercise. I nearly gave mine up before the pandemic, as I was too busy working and socialising to keep the weeds at bay. Boy, am I glad I kept it: as a mother of two energetic boys without much outdoor space at home, our plot has been a lifeline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/11/allotment-hobby-lockdown-lifeline-trade-deals-britain-food">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Belgium’s manager on feeling ready to go all the way at Euro 2020, moving on from the golden generation and why he loves English football<br /></p><p>Until he took the Belgium job, Roberto Martínez felt much the same as any club manager: that there was rarely a timely international break. “But then, when you experience that side of football, you realise it takes the game into a different level,” he says. “Having a whole nation kicking a ball and celebrating a goal, or going through the misery of not being able to win a major tournament. Nothing unifies, or takes celebration to a global scale, like international football.”</p><p>Put like that, perhaps Euro 2020 will provide a salve for troubled times when it belatedly begins next June. Had Covid-19 not intervened so tragically, it is perfectly conceivable that Martínez would have been leading Belgium out at Wembley in the final on Sunday and their “golden generation”, a decade in the making, would have achieved its crowning moment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/11/roberto-martinez-belgium-euro-2020-golden-generation-english-football">Continue reading...</a>

Evocative memories of roaming out of parental reach</p><p>In 1966, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/johnmullan">John Mullan</a> begged his parents for a foreign holiday after a school friend went, with his family, to Majorca for the summer: “My mother shook her head and said: ‘Darling, going abroad is vulgar.’” Instead, they went to shingly Suffolk. Three years later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/harry-ritchie">Harry Ritchie </a>from Kirkcaldy travelled to Majorca on his first foreign holiday. It was a revelation: “Being able to take clothes off for a holiday, rather than having to put more on: that was wonderful in itself.”</p><p>While researching her delightful oral history of school summer holidays, Ysenda Maxtone Graham found that many people didn’t go abroad until they were adults. Indeed, “going-away type holidays” to faraway places are only a part of the story Maxtone Graham tells. Summers were, she finds, “more a matter of stasis than travel”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/11/british-summer-time-begins-by-ysenda-maxtone-graham-review-what-school-summer-holidays-were-like">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I have to take a bus for the first time in months. Can I pull off a flowered mask for the journey?</p><p>When lockdown arrived at the end of March, I braced for profound changes to my existence that never arrived. It certainly isn’t the first time I’ve gone 15 weeks without entering a pub. Now I’m preparing for the lifting of restrictions. Big things are going to happen, I tell myself. But not to you. The highlight of your week is still going to be an argument with a squirrel.</p><p>I come downstairs in the morning to find the house is empty. I unlock the back door and step into the garden to check on a bare patch of lawn I reseeded last week. Tiny bent shoots are poking out of the raked earth. I stare at them for a while. I think about pulling up a chair. My phone rings. It’s my wife.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/11/tim-dowling-everyone-stares-are-they-smiling-behind-their-masks">Continue reading...</a>
