## Eliza Clark: 'I'm from Newcastle and working class. To publishers, I'm diverse'

<p>The author of Boy Parts is keen to stress that she is not underprivileged – and nor is she anything like her sadistic young antiheroine<br /></p><p>The dedication in Eliza Clark’s Boy Parts sets the tone for the tale that follows: “For my mother and father. Please don’t read this.” The novel, a debut by the 26-year-old from Newcastle, will make most readers howl with laughter and/or shut their eyes in horror.</p><p>Irina, a beautiful twentysomething, picks up mediocre-looking men in places such as Tesco and photographs them in compromising positions. When the mother of one young model – “I’d scouted him on the bus and suspected he <em>may</em> have been in sixth form” – tracks her down at her bar job, Irina leaves to focus on her photography, which she’s been invited to show at an exhibition of contemporary fetish art in London. But digging through her archive throws up repressed memories, and so begins a spiral of self-destruction and violence towards her young male muses during their shoots – “Another dig at his mangled nipple elicits a high-pitched, piggy squeal” – that leaves the reader queasy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/22/eliza-clark-from-newcastle-working-class-publishers-diverse-boy-parts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I didn’t expect it to be such hard work – or to be confronted with so many empty beds. But it was also unexpectedly uplifting</p><p>For the past three months, I have been moonlighting as a tea-lady. A few weeks into lockdown, and at the height of the Covid-19 crisis, my father’s care home had become desperately understaffed. Carers were going down with the virus while cleaners were doubling up as kitchen staff, or vice versa. On the day I heard the manager’s partner had had to come in to help serve the lunches, I felt embarrassed at standing by while the walls caved in. So I volunteered my services for twice-weekly shifts.</p><p>This was not as altruistic as it sounds.<strong> </strong>I will admit that I also wanted to keep an eye on my father; in the 15 years since he was diagnosed with frontal lobe dementia, he has been shuttled around numerous homes, some worse than others (one was shut down by the Care Quality Commission), and it has left me in a state of perpetual vigilance. So I turned up, put on a plastic apron and began wheeling a teapot around the ground floor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/jul/22/the-highlight-of-my-lockdown-it-involved-tea-and-a-plastic-apron-">Continue reading...</a>

You can change the flavours to suit your taste. Sometimes I like it spicier and at other times I like it zesty. This granola isn’t very sweet, so you can up the agave syrup or increase the dried-fruit content. Egg white is often used to get the crunchy clusters without increasing the sugar content, but aquafaba works just as well and is vegan-friendly. This granola is best sprinkled on to a bowl of yoghurt and fruit, but works, too, mixed into your crumble topping to give it a real crunch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/22/david-atherton-recipe-crunchy-vegan-granola">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sima Taparia has arranged scores of marriages for wealthy singletons. Now she’s the subject of a Netflix reality show</p><p>“Compromise and adjustment is what I tell all my clients – you need to lower your expectations,” says Sima Taparia. Speaking over video call from Mumbai, one of India’s most well-known matchmakers is telling me what I, apparently, need to hear if I am to find a wife.</p><p>Taparia has been matchmaking wealthy Indian singletons for the past 15 years across the globe, counting some 800 families in her database and resulting in more than 125 marriages. Hers is an arranged marriage service, harnessing<strong> </strong>the practice of parents pairing their adult offspring with those of other, vetted families usually of a similar class and caste. Her process is thorough: she visits her clients at home, interviewing them on their requirements and lifestyle, as well as speaking to their parents before consulting an astrologer on their horoscopes and then feeding this information into her database to find a potential match. Taparia has essentially commercialised the practices of south Asian aunties and grandparents around the world, forever touting their eligible young relatives.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/22/top-tips-from-indian-matchmaking-sima-taparia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Drinking ethanol and saving the world ... an old-school, tautly strung adventure in pursuit of the largest species of owl </p><p>Jonathan Slaght has the best author photograph I’ve ever seen. Pale, bearded, dressed in black, he gazes at the camera with forbidding intensity. Behind him are snowy woods and running water. Arms crossed, hands deep in a pair of unwieldy leather gauntlets, he holds against his chest a huge owl. Its feathers are shaggy and wet, and from its mouth protrudes the tail end of a silver fish. There’s something puppet-like about this creature, like a living Jim Henson creation, but it also resembles a beast pulled straight from the pages of a medieval bestiary – which is fitting, because <em>Owls of the Eastern Ice</em> reads like a modern-day grail quest: a tale of one man’s travels through a daunting landscape of snow and ice and radioactive rivers, searching for an animal that seems all ghost.</p><p>A confession: I’ve never understood why so many people are obsessed with owls. I once cared for a rescued barn owl, and while it was a beautiful creature, possessing a cat-like hauteur and strangely human face, it was about as rewarding to interact with as a porcelain statuette. But I’m happy to report that this book has changed me. I have become an ardent fan of the largest living species of owl, the Blakiston’s fish owl. Huge, elusive and endangered denizens of the deep forests of Japan, China and the Russian far east, these marvellously odd birds wade through icy water to catch fish, sing in low, hooted duets, possess a thick layer of insulating fat, a wingspan that can top six and a half feet, and have been venerated as gods by the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2019/apr/30/dream-weavers-the-ainu-people-of-japan-in-pictures">Ainu of Hokkaido</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/22/owls-of-the-eastern-ice-by-jonathan-c-slaght-review-an-extraordinary-quest">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic arrived in the run up to the tourist season, hitting seaside towns hard. We visited Brighton to find out how businesses and beach-goers are adapting</p><p>Of all the things coronavirus has taken away from life on Brighton’s seafront, among the saddest must be the high-fives. Previously undertaken without worrying where hands have been and what germs they might be carrying, they are now strongly discouraged: a sign actively bans them. “It says ‘No high-fives’,” says Katie Mintram, with a small laugh. She has run <a href="https://yellowave.co.uk/">Yellowave beach sports centre</a> – a cafe and several volleyball courts – since 2007. She is navigating her way through a summer that feels very different from normal. “In volleyball, it’s all about high-fives.”</p><p>Yellowave is on the beach itself. Stepping over the tracks of the Volk’s Electric Railway (still closed) from a very quiet Madeira Drive is like stepping into a parallel world – busy, peopled, thriving, normal. Each of the six courts is full, matches being played by fit, happy people in shorts and bikinis; many of the cafe’s outdoor tables have customers sitting at them. It is nowhere near as bleak as the shuttered snack bars and souvenir shops on the main road. That is because there is a tournament on, explains Mintram – the first of the summer. “If the tournament wasn’t here, it probably would have been a bit more depressing,” she says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/22/its-like-having-three-winters-how-covid-19-has-changed-the-british-seaside">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The release of Christopher Nolan’s thriller has been paused indefinitely while the US wrestles with Covid-19. But why should the rest of the world have to wait?</p><p>Growing up in the 1980s, there was always one classmate who would go to the US for the summer holidays and come back raving about new movies such as ET: The Extra-Terrestrial or Ghostbusters. Us Brits would then have to wait until Christmas to see them, by which time our expectations had become so over-inflated the movies rarely lived up to them (sacrilege I know, but Ghostbusters was way better in my head). In movie terms, going to the US was like visiting the future. Now, though, the situation has practically reversed.</p><p>In recent decades, the time delay has narrowed to the extent that most big movies now come out on the same day, or at least within weeks, everywhere from LA to Lima. However, Covid-19 has created a further complication: most of Europe, Oceania and east Asia has been getting on top of the pandemic. The US has not. So while cinemas are tentatively reopening around the world, they remain almost entirely shuttered in key markets such as California, Texas, Florida and New York.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/22/as-tenet-is-delayed-yet-again-is-it-time-to-end-cinemas-america-first-policy">Continue reading...</a>
