Cell, Making Sense of Mutation: What D614G Means for the COVID-19 Pandemic Remains Unclear 

https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30817-5.pdf

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a low mutation rate overall

Much lower than the viruses that cause influenza and HIV-AIDS

Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China in late 2019

Virus mutations

A virus mutation can become common through fitness or by chance

Emerged early during the pandemic

Aspartate to glycine, D614G mutation

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.161323v1

Dominant mutational variant at the 614 position of S protein
 
Old version D614 (Aspartate)

New version G614 (Glycine)

G614 is most prevalent in many places around the world

Korber et al. (2020) hypothesized that the rapid spread of G614 was because it is more infectious than D614

Will D614G Make Outbreaks Harder to Control?

The great majority of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the United States arrived from Europe

Over the period that G614 became the global majority variant, the number of introductions from China where D614 was still dominant were declining

As numbers in Europe were going up

If G614 truly is more transmissible in equivalently mixing populations

Not enough in vivo data just now

Will D614G Make Infections More Severe?

Patients infected with G614 had higher levels of virus RNA 

But no differences identified in hospital outcomes

Will D614G Impact Therapeutic and Vaccine Designs?

Unlikely

D614G is not in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein

Antibodies generated from natural infection with viruses containing D614 or G614 can cross-neutralize

Suggesting that the locus is not critical for antibody - mediated immunity

Conclusions 

The G614 variant now is the pandemic

"it will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better.

"Something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is."

"We're asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask.” 

“Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact, they'll have an effect and we need everything we can get," 

Getting used to masks and would wear one himself in groups or when on an elevator

"I will use it, gladly," 

"Anything that potentially can help ... is a good thing."

Dr Tedros had struck a deal with China that helped him secure election

WHO was a “political” rather than “science-based organisation” that had failed to deal with the pandemic

Dr Tedros, who was ... bought by the Chinese government,

I can’t say more, but I can tell, I’m saying this on a firm intelligence foundation, a deal was made... 

there was a deal making election and when push came to shove, you get dead Britons, because of the deal that was made.”

India

Cases, + 37,724 = 1, 193, 078

Deaths, 28, 732

National Centre for Disease Control

Tested 21,387 people selected randomly across Delhi area

23.48 % (22.86%) had COVID antibodies 

Therefore, most cases have gone undetected

Delhi population = 26,000,000 (2016)

5,934,600 infections

1% death rate = 59,000

70% would be 18, 200,000

Deaths therefore possibly rising to 182,000
