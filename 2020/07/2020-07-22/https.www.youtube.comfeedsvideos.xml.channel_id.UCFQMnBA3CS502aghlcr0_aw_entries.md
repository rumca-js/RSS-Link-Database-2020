Nikhil Autar was 17 when he got cancer. That's when the 'Miracle Cure' Facebook Ads and Direct Messages started...

By the way, to be completely clear, neither myself or Nikhil are against Alternative Medicine perse, we're against the awful anti-science that often goes with it that leads to increased mortality. 

STUDIES: 
2-5.7x higher rates of death in various cancers in a large study:
https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/110/1/121/4064136
Cancer patients on alternative medicines/with alternative practitioners refuse radiotherapy 53% of the time, chemos 34% of the time, and surgery 7% of the time, which is all MUCH higher than patients who aren't exposed to these dudes/treatments (refusal of surgery was literally 0.1% of the time, radiotherapy 2.3% and chemo 3.4% compared to those ridiculous numbers). Similarly higher rates of death were seen in patients.

This is despite no improvements in quality of life being demonstrated with many modalities.

There are many studies which look into the increase in complimentary medicines after cancer diagnosis. Before cancer 16% of people would use some kind of modality, after acncer diagnosis, that number rises to 52%.
