Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJuly 22, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- After performing her opening song, \"Heat Rises,\" Nil\u00fcfer Yanya pauses to say a few things about herself, something we've been asking artists to do for these Tiny Desk (home) concerts.\n\n\"One of the things that's been on my mind a lot is the racism and violence and injustice going on towards Black people and people of color, not only in America but here in the U.K. and all over the world. As a person of mixed heritage\" \u2014 Nil\u00fcfer's father is Turkish and her mother is of Irish and Barbadian descent \u2014 \"this issue is something close to my heart.\" Nil\u00fcfer urges us all to see the hurt being done. It's the only way forward.\n\nShe then plays \"Paralyzed,\" a song she's not performed live before, from her brilliant 2019 record Miss Universe. I hear these words so differently now:\n\nI hear strained screams from Heaven singin'\n\"save me\"\nThis can't be okay\nShadow's lyin' here\nAnd it's blocking out the light\n(I am paralyzed)\n\nShe also unveils a new song for us, \"Day 7,\" and performs two others from Miss Universe, providing a lovely contrast to her full-band performance at my desk last year and an easy introduction to an artist who may, and most likely will, make her way to your heart.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Heat Rises\"\n\"Paralysed\"\n\"Day 7\"\n\"Heavyweight Champion of the Year\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNil\u00fcfer Yanya: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nAudio By: Joe Dworniak, Riverfish Studios; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfY1i-XONxo", "date_published": "2020-07-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Redman Mehldau McBride Blade (Live at The Falcon) | JAZZ NIGHT IN AMERICA", "description": "Watch a post concert interview here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLyIISEQuDs\n\n\nThe first time around was special, and everyone knew it.
