Thanks to Shadow for sponsoring today's video! Check them out at https://lmg.gg/c2eqf

Cloud gaming is getting more popular, and we're not strangers in how they work, but have you actually thought about what the hardware looks like when you play games or whatever on them? We convinced Shadow to send us one of their units, and they actually agreed to it... I hope they knew what they were agreeing to. 

Check out the video where we toured their office and even their data center at https://youtu.be/0BQ4bXNdEQI
