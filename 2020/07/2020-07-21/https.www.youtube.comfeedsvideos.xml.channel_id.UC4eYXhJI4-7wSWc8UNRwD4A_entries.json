As a person of mixed heritage\" \u2014 Nil\u00fcfer's father is Turkish and her mother is of Irish and Barbadian descent \u2014 \"this issue is something close to my heart.\" Nil\u00fcfer urges us all to see the hurt being done. It's the only way forward.\n\nShe then plays \"Paralyzed,\" a song she's not performed live before, from her brilliant 2019 record Miss Universe. I hear these words so differently now:\n\nI hear strained screams from Heaven singin'\n\"save me\"\nThis can't be okay\nShadow's lyin' here\nAnd it's blocking out the light\n(I am paralyzed)\n\nShe also unveils a new song for us, \"Day 7,\" and performs two others from Miss Universe, providing a lovely contrast to her full-band performance at my desk last year and an easy introduction to an artist who may, and most likely will, make her way to your heart.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Heat Rises\"\n\"Paralysed\"\n\"Day 7\"\n\"Heavyweight Champion of the Year\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNil\u00fcfer Yanya: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nAudio By: Joe Dworniak, Riverfish Studios; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfY1i-XONxo", "date_published": "2020-07-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Redman Mehldau McBride Blade (Live at The Falcon) | JAZZ NIGHT IN AMERICA", "description": "Watch a post concert interview here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLyIISEQuDs\n\n\nThe first time around was special, and everyone knew it.

It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | July 21, 2020\nOne of my top albums in 2017 was Silence, from Tom Adams \u2013 that transfixing falsetto set against minimalist piano was a balm. I imagined his Tiny Desk (home) concert to be Tom and his piano; what we have is Tom Adams at his home in Cornwall, England, playing four brand-new songs with minimal electric guitar and an enthralling mix of tech-altered sounds. That box with all the wires in the foreground is a Eurorack modular synthesizer which, in real time, processes his majestic voice in ways unpredictable even to Tom. He wrote to tell me that, \"Once the system is set in motion, you never know exactly what will happen next... I like to think of it as being a bit like the waves on the beach; to some extent, they are all predictable, yet each wave is still unique.\" It's a lovely way to describe this new music from this singular talent.\n\nSET LIST\n\"The Turning Of The Year\"\n\"A Flower Disappearing\"\n\"If My Love Was A Guitar\"\n\"Postcards From The Road\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTom Adams: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Tom Adams; Audio By: Tom Adams; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZUdt79HNsI", "date_published": "2020-07-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
