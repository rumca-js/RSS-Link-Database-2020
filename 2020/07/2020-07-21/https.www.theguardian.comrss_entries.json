We need plurality in journalism", "description": "<p>Two prominent US columnists resigned last week \u2013 prompting renewed debate about inclusivity</p><p><strong>What can we learn from Bari Weiss\u2019s and Andrew Sullivan\u2019s resignations?</strong><br /><em>David, by email</em><br /><br />Forgive me, we\u2019re going to go a little inside baseball this week. Now, for those who have better things to do with their lives than spend all their time online on social media sites (weirdos), a quick catchup. Bari Weiss was a columnist at the New York Times and Andrew Sullivan was a columnist at New York magazine. Weiss, in particular, was what is euphemistically called \u201ca polarising figure\u201d, which is a nice way of saying she drove some people completely bananas.<br /><br />I met Weiss this year when she came to London to promote her book, How to Fight Anti-Semitism and we have stayed friendly since. But, even before I met her, I never really got the ferocity she provokes, this young woman on the American centre-left who is pro-Israel. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/opinion/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-bari-weiss.html\">I loved some things she wrote</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/opinion/intellectual-dark-web.html\">disagreed with others</a>, which is true of pretty much every columnist I read, because who agrees with anyone about everything?</p><p>In the end, it wasn\u2019t a column that spelled the end for Weiss, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bariweiss/status/1268628680797978625?s=20\">a tweet thread</a>, posted last month. She defended the New York Times\u2019 decision to publish <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/new-york-times-says-tom-cotton-opinion-piece-did-not-meet-editorial-standards\">an op-ed by the Republican senator Tom Cotton</a>, in which he argued that the military should be brought in to end the riots in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. Other Times reporters tweeted that, by publishing this piece by a US senator, the Times had put them \u201cin danger\u201d, and two editors <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/07/media/james-bennet-new-york-times-resigns/index.html\">ended up stepping down</a>. In the middle of all this, Weiss tweeted that there was a \u201ccivil war inside the New York Times between (mostly young) wokes and the (mostly 40-plus) liberals\u201d, saying that the former believe that \u201cto feel emotionally and psychologically safe trumps \u2026 free speech\u201d, while the latter group \u201clives by a set of principles we can broadly call civil libertarianism\u201d.<br /><br />Well, from the reaction from some on the left, you would have thought Weiss had demanded the slaughter of all household pets, as opposed to stating a pretty commonplace theory. After being pilloried on Twitter, Weiss resigned last week. <a href=\"https://www.bariweiss.com/resignation-letter\">She posted a letter</a> detailing how colleagues had smeared and vilified her on Twitter and on the New York Times\u2019 Slack messaging system, and said that Twitter had become the \u201cultimate editor\u201d of the New York Times, with writers and editors self-censoring out of fear of causing a social-media backlash.<br /><br />Two days later, Sullivan, a widely revered columnist, also stepped down because, he <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/andrew-sullivan-see-you-next-friday.html\">said in his letter</a>, \u201ca critical mass of the staff and management \u2026 no longer want to associate with me \u2026 They seem to believe, and this is increasingly the orthodoxy in mainstream media, that any writer not actively committed to critical theory in questions of race, gender, sexual orientation and gender identity is actively, physically harming co-workers merely by existing in the same virtual space.\u201d<br /><br />Stories like this inevitably become a culture war, with everyone picking their side according to how they see themselves politically (although I would wager that a fair few people tweeting about Weiss, especially in the UK, have never read a single article by her). To some, this looks like old rightwing dinosaurs refusing to adapt to the times. To others, it\u2019s lefty censorship. Weiss and Sullivan haven\u2019t been censored, but it sounds as if they have \u2013 Weiss in particular \u2013 been bullied. She says she has been called a Nazi and a racist by colleagues and has had to brush off comments that she is \u201cwriting about the Jews again\u201d.<br /><br />Sullivan is patently right in saying there are currently certain orthodoxies in left-leaning US news organisations, and Weiss is also clearly right to point to Twitter as part of the problem. Most journalists, myself included, are on Twitter too much, and I have certainly felt the brunt of Twitter when I have swerved from whatever the left-leaning orthodoxy is. It\u2019s bearable, if not especially pleasant, but if New York Times journalists and editors are self-censoring to avoid Twitter pile-ons, then that\u2019s a problem, not least because Twitter is an incredibly niche voice; one that reflects a tiny percentage of the population.</p> <a

His mother, born to penury in Scotland, remained so meanly thrifty that every week she dressed up in her fur stole and drove her pink Cadillac around the New York suburbs to collect small change from the coin-operated laundry rooms in buildings the family owned; her piggy banks were empty tin cans that once contained lard. She remained emotionally absent, preoccupied by her ailments, while her husband viewed their male offspring as mere off-prints of himself, begotten to ensure that the family kept a grip on its spoils.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/21/too-much-and-never-enough-by-mary-l-trump-review-donald-trump-niece\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/21/too-much-and-never-enough-by-mary-l-trump-review-donald-trump-niece", "date_published": "2020-07-21 06:00:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The 'big society' is long gone.
