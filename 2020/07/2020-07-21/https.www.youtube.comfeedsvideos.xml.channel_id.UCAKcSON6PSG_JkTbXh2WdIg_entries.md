Burk Uzzle has enjoyed a decades-long career as a photojournalist, capturing some of the most iconic images of the past 50 years, including the photo that became the cover of the Woodstock album.

In recent years, Uzzle has moved to Wilson, N.C., and his photographic artwork has taken on new dimensions. One of Uzzle's passions, inspired by his work documenting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, is the matter of race and equality in America.

Uzzle's life and work have recently been captured in a new documentary from director Jethro Waters, "F11 and Be There," distributed by First Run Features.
