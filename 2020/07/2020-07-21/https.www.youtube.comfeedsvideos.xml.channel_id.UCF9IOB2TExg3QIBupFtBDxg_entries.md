"it will probably unfortunately get worse before it gets better.

"Something I don't like saying about things, but that's the way it is."

"We're asking everybody that when you are not able to socially distance, wear a mask, get a mask.” 

“Whether you like the mask or not, they have an impact, they'll have an effect and we need everything we can get," 

Getting used to masks and would wear one himself in groups or when on an elevator

"I will use it, gladly," 

"Anything that potentially can help ... is a good thing."

Dr Tedros had struck a deal with China that helped him secure election

WHO was a “political” rather than “science-based organisation” that had failed to deal with the pandemic

Dr Tedros, who was ... bought by the Chinese government,

I can’t say more, but I can tell, I’m saying this on a firm intelligence foundation, a deal was made... 

there was a deal making election and when push came to shove, you get dead Britons, because of the deal that was made.”

India

Cases, + 37,724 = 1, 193, 078

Deaths, 28, 732

National Centre for Disease Control

Tested 21,387 people selected randomly across Delhi area

23.48 % (22.86%) had COVID antibodies 

Therefore, most cases have gone undetected

Delhi population = 26,000,000 (2016)

5,934,600 infections

1% death rate = 59,000

70% would be 18, 200,000

Deaths therefore possibly rising to 182,000

Amarnath Yatra cancelled

Australia

Victoria
Cases, + 484 (a daily record)

Mandatory for everyone in the state to wear masks when they leave their homes.

Well, probably. Synairgen's SNG001, Interferon beta

£21.29 per injection

http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/synairgens_sng001_shows_strong_promise_in_covid-19_trial_1345119

Interferon beta

Naturally occurring antiviral protein

Cytokine

Interfere with viral replication

Induce fever and muscle pains (along with other cytokines)

Activate immune cells, natural killer cells and macrophages

Reduces protein synthesis in adjacent cells

Activates an enzyme to destroy RNA, further reducing protein synthesis

Stimulates many other interferon-stimulated genes

Stimulates infected cells into apoptosis

Key component of human immune defence against viral infection

Phase 2 study

Inhaled interferon beta

Gives high local concentrations

Placebo controlled

n = 101 hospitalised patients 

All patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2

9 UK hospitals

Diabetics
Treatment group = 9 
Placebo group = 3

Cardiovascular disease
Treatment group = 5
Placebo group = 8

Now recruiting patients ill with COVID-19 in the community

Results

79% reduction in risk of developing severe disease

Requiring ventilation or resulting in death

During the treatment period

Day one to day 16

This difference was also noted to day 28

Patients who received SNG001 were more than twice as likely to recover

Defined as ‘no limitation of activities’ or ‘no clinical or virological evidence of infection’

Measure of breathlessness, markedly reduced

In patients with more severe disease at time of admission

SNG001 increased the likelihood of hospital discharge during the study

Six days versus nine days for those receiving placebo (not significant difference)

More than twice as likely to have recovered by the end of the treatment period (strong 
trend)

Safety

6% died after being randomised to placebo

No deaths in the SNG001 group
