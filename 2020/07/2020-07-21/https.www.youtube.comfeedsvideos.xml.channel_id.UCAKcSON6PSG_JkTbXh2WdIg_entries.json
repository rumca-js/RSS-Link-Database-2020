One of Uzzle's passions, inspired by his work documenting Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s, is the matter of race and equality in America.\n\nUzzle's life and work have recently been captured in a new documentary from director Jethro Waters, \"F11 and Be There,\" distributed by First Run Features.\n\nCredits\nGuest - Burk Uzzle\nHost - Mary Lucia\nProducer - Luke Taylor\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZIe0tuGIXo", "date_published": "2020-07-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Rufus Wainwright - two performances", "description": "Wednesday, July 22, is Rufus Wainwright's birthday, and we're starting the celebration early with a couple of great performances Rufus has done for us over the years.
