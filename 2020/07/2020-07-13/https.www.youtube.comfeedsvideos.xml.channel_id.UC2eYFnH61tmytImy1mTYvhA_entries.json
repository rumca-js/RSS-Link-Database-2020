PeerTube is a federated video system: meaning you can host your own videos and connect to other PeerTube instances. It has all the features of YouTube and more and is torrent based to minimize bandwidth usage.\n\nThis will cost me money to maintain, but again, I'll be able to do more stuff when I don't have to worried about YouTube's expanding and purposefully ambiguous terms of service.
