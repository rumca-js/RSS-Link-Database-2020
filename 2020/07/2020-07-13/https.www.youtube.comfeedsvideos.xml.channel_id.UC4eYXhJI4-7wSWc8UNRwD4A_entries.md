The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

July 14, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- I've never come across a moderate Benny Sings fan. The Dutch singer-songwriter and producer has maintained a cult following for over 15 years and performed in the United States for the very first time at the Tiny Desk back in 2016. He's released a couple of singles since we've transitioned to Tiny Desk (home) concerts and I felt it was the opportune moment to ask him to take part. Recorded at his studio in Amsterdam, the set list reads like an inventory of quarantine essentials, opening with "Apartment" from last year's Free Nationals LP and closing with "Music." The hook reminds me that I'm not the only one who continues to seek refuge in song. He sings, "Music help me through this / I can't do this on my own / But music help me through this / Whenever I'm down."

SET LIST
"Apartment"
"Sunny Afternoon"
"Music"

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | July 13, 2020
Producer/guitarist Tom Misch and drummer Yussef Dayes released a surprising and stunning collaborative album earlier this year called What Kinda Music, which I've listened to countless times these past couple months. This Tiny Desk (home) concert — recorded across six different musicians' homes — features two songs from that album, "Nightrider" and "Tidal Wave." On the former, special guest John Mayer provides a closing solo, just as he did at last year's Crossroads Guitar Festival. Also accompanying is longtime Misch collaborator Jordan Rakei and Tom Driessler on bass. "Tidal Wave," featuring Rocco Palladino on bass and Joel Culpepper on backing vocals, is equally hypnotic. Like the album, this short set evokes a dreamy utopia, blending live electronica, psychedelia and avant-garde jazz. The poignant hook of "Tidal Wave" — "Chaos / Throwing midnight like a tidal wave / Raindrops / Filling up your eyes as the water takes the stage" — feels symbolic and resonant with the current state of the world.

SET LIST
"Nightrider"
"Tidal Wave"
