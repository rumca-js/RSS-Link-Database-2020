As one grieving woman reflects, \u201cWhen people die, they need to be celebrated and there is no celebration of life right now.

That number would likely have been higher by hundreds were it not for one woman and her town, who worked together to save and shelter fleeing cadets.\n\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\n\n\u201cI can hear a voice calling now that reminds me of them,\u201d the woman, Um Qusay, says in the above excerpt from FRONTLINE\u2019s new documentary \"Once Upon a Time in Iraq.\" Gazing out on the same river she helped the cadets cross before hiding them in her home, she remembers hearing their cries: \u201cSave us, save us. We are your brothers.\u201d \n\nShe and others in her town of al Alam heeded their call. All told, she says, she and the people of al Alam helped save 850 men from Speicher.\n\n\u201cOf course we were afraid,\u201d she says. But putting herself in danger to help the cadets was a risk was worth taking.\n\n\u201cThe reason was that first of all, they are Iraqi,\u201d Um Qusay says. \u201cAnd secondly, I hated ISIS. Someone has to help and stand against them.\u201d\n\nThen, she offers a closing thought: \u201cAnd without love, the whole world would be killing each other.\u201d\n\n Watch \"Once Upon a Time in Iraq\" in full starting July 14: https://to.pbs.org/2CAMKi8\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 300 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
