Thank goodness for this three-word advice \u2026</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>Holidays.<br /><br /><strong>Age:</strong> More than a thousand years.<br /><br /><strong>Wow! Did the Anglo-Saxons really take trips to Benidorm?</strong> Try to treat this seriously. Holiday is derived from the Old English word <em>h\u0101ligd\u00e6g</em>, meaning holy day. It was a day set aside for religious observance. The trips to Southend and beyond came later.<br /><br /><strong>And when did we stop taking them? </strong>That\u2019s easier. In 2020, we abandoned holidays in the travel sense and went back to praying. Vacations out; vocations in.<br /><br /><strong>But seriously, do you think holidays are over? </strong>Well, the newspapers have pictures of the odd bikini-clad Brit sitting in splendid isolation beside a pool in Spain, but in reality people will be taking fewer foreign holidays this summer.<br /><br /><strong>Why</strong><strong>? </strong>The information on which countries you can and can\u2019t travel to without quarantining seems to change every day. Air travel is now even more unpleasant than before. And if you do manage to get to your four-star hotel in Ibiza, you\u2019ll probably have to book for the pool and there will be no breakfast buffet.<br /><br /><strong>Oh well, it\u2019ll have to be a staycation for me. </strong>That will please Boris Johnson, who says you will be doing your bit for the economy. But expect to have your temperature checked on arrival; there will be queues for the lift because numbers will be restricted; and you will be encouraged to eat in your room.<br /><br /><strong>Any other options?</strong> Adventurer and chief scout <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/11/bear-grylls-encourages-return-to-wild-with-back-garden-scout-camp\">Bear Grylls</a> is fronting a campaign to encourage children to camp out in their garden or a nearby park. <br /><br /><strong>It would at least be cheap. </strong>And I suppose you could have the breakfast buffet.<br /><br /><strong>OK, how much is a pop-up tent? I guess I\u2019ll just have to wait until 2021 to go further afield. </strong>Indeed, but start planning now if you want to go anywhere in the EU. The government\u2019s new Check, Change, Go ad campaign \u2013 how it loves those three-word slogans \u2013 is stressing the problems that will face holidaymakers after the end of the Brexit transition period in December. <br /><br /><strong>Such as?</strong> Higher travel insurance charges; higher mobile phone costs; tougher passport controls; long bureaucratic delays to get a pet passport.<br /><br /><strong>Project Fear?</strong> Project Reality!<strong><br /><br />What does Check, Change, Go actually mean?</strong> It is being widely interpreted on social media. <em>\u201cCheck</em> what Boris Johnson said during the referendum campaign; <em>change</em> your plans to visit the EU; <em>go</em> back to the 1970s,\u201d sums up the general mood.<br /><br /><strong>But I thought we were taking back control with an oven-ready deal that was going to save the NHS \u00a3350m a week and get us better terms than we ever had as members of the EU. </strong>You poor gullible fool.

Perhaps the most notorious superstition surrounds the word \u201cMacbeth\u201d, which should not \u2013 except during a live performance \u2013 be uttered inside the theatre. In fact, the superstition is so deeply embedded that there is no sign for the word \u201cMacbeth\u201d in British Sign Language. To get round this \u201cdeadly\u201d issue, actors refer to Macbeth as \u201cThe Scottish Play\u201d or \u201cThe Bard\u2019s Play\u201d.</p><p>But is there any basis to this long-standing superstition? When Macbeth premiered circa 1606, King James I was on the English throne \u2013 and James was not a fan of witches. The execution of James\u2019s mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, was said to have inspired a long-lasting obsession with the dark arts, one compounded after the king was caught in a brutal storm at sea when he was king of Scotland. Convinced that witches were to blame, James ordered a witch-hunt on his return home and swiftly wrote a book, Daemonologie, where he outlined his plans to root out witchcraft for good.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/13/is-the-word-macbeth-really-cursed\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/13/is-the-word-macbeth-really-cursed", "date_published": "2020-07-13 12:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Thomasina Miers' recipe for potato and chickpea curry | The simple fix", "description": "<p>An adaptable vegetarian curry that\u2019s supple to the tooth and bursting with flavour </p><p>When I was growing up, my father would cook a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/madhur-jaffrey\">Madhur Jaffrey</a> potato curry that I still make to this day.

They married in 1991 and became probably the most devotedly uxorious Hollywood couple since Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman. Preston and Travolta have a great sexy-funny dance routine together in the 1989 comedy The Experts, which is how they met. Preston put her acting career on hold for some of the 90s while she and Travolta started a family: having two sons, Jett and Benjamin, and a daughter, Ella. Heart-rendingly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/05/john-travolta-son-grief\">Jett died of a seizure at the age of 16</a>, a memory that adds a new layer of sadness to today\u2019s news, and a new layer of sombre reflection about the great pressures that a woman in public life is expected to undergo.</p><p>In her 20s, Preston got sexy supporting-cast Hollywood roles in movies such as the 1988 box-office smash Twins, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito as the bizarrely un-similar titular siblings. Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger\u2019s gentle giant while Chloe Webb played her twin sister Linda, who is paired off with wisecracking DeVito. It is a measure of the sexist stereotyping of Hollywood that while the men are supposed to be hilariously different, she and Webb are the non-twins playing regular twins with 80s big hair, basically indistinguishable not just from each other but all the other \u201csexy\u201d roles that Hollywood compels its female stars to fit into. Two years earlier, she had been in a quintessentially 80s teen comedy Mischief \u2013 the kind of movie which lived endlessly on in VHS rental outlets throughout the world \u2013 playing the hot blonde fantasy object of the shy adolescent boy.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/13/kelly-preston-a-classy-actor-who-graduated-from-teen-movie-roles-to-darker-and-funnier-parts\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/13/kelly-preston-a-classy-actor-who-graduated-from-teen-movie-roles-to-darker-and-funnier-parts", "date_published": "2020-07-13 10:12:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tottenham Hotspur confirm death of Serge Aurier's brother in Toulouse", "description": "<ul><li>Christopher Aurier, 26, was also a footballer<br /></li><li>The death took place in the French city of Toulouse</li></ul><p>Tottenham Hotspur have confirmed the death of the brother of Serge Aurier in Toulouse. <br /><br />A club statement read: \u201cThe Club is deeply saddened to confirm media reports that Serge Aurier\u2019s brother passed away in the early hours of this morning.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe are supporting Serge at this difficult time and we ask that the privacy of the player and his family is respected.

Around the time Bu\u00f1uel and Dal\u00ed were slicing up eyeballs in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/29/lage-dor-bunuel-chien-andalou-philip-french\">Un Chien Andalou</a>, innovators such as Max Fleischer were toying with the reality-warping potential of the medium. Looking at his 1930s Betty Boop cartoons, you can\u2019t believe LSD hadn\u2019t been invented yet. Parallel dream worlds open up, inanimate objects come to life, and the laws of physics are in thrall to the rhythm of the jazz. Surrealism found a safe haven in Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbera, and even Disney, who in 1945 collaborated with Dal\u00ed himself on an extremely Dal\u00ed-esque, animation called Destino (which was not finished until 2003).</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/13/surrealism-and-animation-they-go-together-like-a-lobster-telephone-bunuel-and-the-labyrinth-of-turtles\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/13/surrealism-and-animation-they-go-together-like-a-lobster-telephone-bunuel-and-the-labyrinth-of-turtles", "date_published": "2020-07-13 08:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Why is Andromeda waiting for her man?
