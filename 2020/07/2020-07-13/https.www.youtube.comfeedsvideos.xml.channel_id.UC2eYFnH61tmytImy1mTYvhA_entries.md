I'm started to host my most based and red-pilled videos on a PeerTube instance I have on my website: https://videos.lukesmith.xyz. PeerTube is a federated video system: meaning you can host your own videos and connect to other PeerTube instances. It has all the features of YouTube and more and is torrent based to minimize bandwidth usage.

This will cost me money to maintain, but again, I'll be able to do more stuff when I don't have to worried about YouTube's expanding and purposefully ambiguous terms of service. If you want to help out, donate to help my instance here: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate.
