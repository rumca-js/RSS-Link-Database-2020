It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJuly 14, 2020 | Bobby Carter -- I've never come across a moderate Benny Sings fan. The Dutch singer-songwriter and producer has maintained a cult following for over 15 years and performed in the United States for the very first time at the Tiny Desk back in 2016. He's released a couple of singles since we've transitioned to Tiny Desk (home) concerts and I felt it was the opportune moment to ask him to take part. Recorded at his studio in Amsterdam, the set list reads like an inventory of quarantine essentials, opening with \"Apartment\" from last year's Free Nationals LP and closing with \"Music.\" The hook reminds me that I'm not the only one who continues to seek refuge in song. He sings, \"Music help me through this / I can't do this on my own / But music help me through this / Whenever I'm down.\"\n\nSET LIST\n\"Apartment\"\n\"Sunny Afternoon\"\n\"Music\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBenny Sings: vocals, keys; Adam Bar Pereg: keys, vocals; June Fermie: vocals; Bram Wassink: bass; Colin Lee: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Benny Sings; Audio By: Benny Sings; Producer: Bobby Carter; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4vnYGgoYBQ", "date_published": "2020-07-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tom Misch and Yussef Dayes: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future.

This Tiny Desk (home) concert \u2014 recorded across six different musicians' homes \u2014 features two songs from that album, \"Nightrider\" and \"Tidal Wave.\" On the former, special guest John Mayer provides a closing solo, just as he did at last year's Crossroads Guitar Festival. Also accompanying is longtime Misch collaborator Jordan Rakei and Tom Driessler on bass. \"Tidal Wave,\" featuring Rocco Palladino on bass and Joel Culpepper on backing vocals, is equally hypnotic. Like the album, this short set evokes a dreamy utopia, blending live electronica, psychedelia and avant-garde jazz. The poignant hook of \"Tidal Wave\" \u2014 \"Chaos / Throwing midnight like a tidal wave / Raindrops / Filling up your eyes as the water takes the stage\" \u2014 feels symbolic and resonant with the current state of the world.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Nightrider\"\n\"Tidal Wave\"\n\nMUSICIANS \nTom Misch: vocals, guitar; Yussef Dayes: drums; Tom Driessler: bass; Rocco Palladino: bass; Joel Culpepper: vocals; Jordan Rakei: vocals; John Mayer: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Joseph Dunn; Audio By: Tom Misch; Producer: Abby O'Neill; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eXGtT7E5aU", "date_published": "2020-07-13 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
