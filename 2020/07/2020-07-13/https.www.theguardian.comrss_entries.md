## Check, Change, Go: what the UK government's latest slogan means for your holiday

<p>Holidaymakers will soon face higher travel insurance charges and mobile phone costs, and tougher passport controls. Thank goodness for this three-word advice …</p><p><strong>Name: </strong>Holidays.<br /><br /><strong>Age:</strong> More than a thousand years.<br /><br /><strong>Wow! Did the Anglo-Saxons really take trips to Benidorm?</strong> Try to treat this seriously. Holiday is derived from the Old English word <em>hāligdæg</em>, meaning holy day. It was a day set aside for religious observance. The trips to Southend and beyond came later.<br /><br /><strong>And when did we stop taking them? </strong>That’s easier. In 2020, we abandoned holidays in the travel sense and went back to praying. Vacations out; vocations in.<br /><br /><strong>But seriously, do you think holidays are over? </strong>Well, the newspapers have pictures of the odd bikini-clad Brit sitting in splendid isolation beside a pool in Spain, but in reality people will be taking fewer foreign holidays this summer.<br /><br /><strong>Why</strong><strong>? </strong>The information on which countries you can and can’t travel to without quarantining seems to change every day. Air travel is now even more unpleasant than before. And if you do manage to get to your four-star hotel in Ibiza, you’ll probably have to book for the pool and there will be no breakfast buffet.<br /><br /><strong>Oh well, it’ll have to be a staycation for me. </strong>That will please Boris Johnson, who says you will be doing your bit for the economy. But expect to have your temperature checked on arrival; there will be queues for the lift because numbers will be restricted; and you will be encouraged to eat in your room.<br /><br /><strong>Any other options?</strong> Adventurer and chief scout <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/11/bear-grylls-encourages-return-to-wild-with-back-garden-scout-camp">Bear Grylls</a> is fronting a campaign to encourage children to camp out in their garden or a nearby park. <br /><br /><strong>It would at least be cheap. </strong>And I suppose you could have the breakfast buffet.<br /><br /><strong>OK, how much is a pop-up tent? I guess I’ll just have to wait until 2021 to go further afield. </strong>Indeed, but start planning now if you want to go anywhere in the EU. The government’s new Check, Change, Go ad campaign – how it loves those three-word slogans – is stressing the problems that will face holidaymakers after the end of the Brexit transition period in December. <br /><br /><strong>Such as?</strong> Higher travel insurance charges; higher mobile phone costs; tougher passport controls; long bureaucratic delays to get a pet passport.<br /><br /><strong>Project Fear?</strong> Project Reality!<strong><br /><br />What does Check, Change, Go actually mean?</strong> It is being widely interpreted on social media. <em>“Check</em> what Boris Johnson said during the referendum campaign; <em>change</em> your plans to visit the EU; <em>go</em> back to the 1970s,” sums up the general mood.<br /><br /><strong>But I thought we were taking back control with an oven-ready deal that was going to save the NHS £350m a week and get us better terms than we ever had as members of the EU. </strong>You poor gullible fool. You need a holiday.<br /><br /><strong>Do say:</strong> “I hear New Malden is nice at this time of year.”</p><p><strong>Don’t say:</strong> “It’s two weeks in the Algarve for us this August as usual.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/shortcuts/2020/jul/13/check-change-go-uk-government-slogan-holiday-advice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Back-to-back Tests from Thursday present an opportunity for mass rotation, keeping players fresh in their biosecure bubble</p><p>England lose and there is so much to applaud. In the wake of West Indies’ victory heated debates have long since commenced. Where was Stuart Broad? Fancy batting in those conditions. What about Joe Denly and Jos Buttler? Why did we underestimate a team dubbed by one expert punster “Jason and his Out for Noughts”? And this is all brilliant.</p><p>The fear was that the intricate, expensive experiment of playing Test cricket behind closed doors in a biosecure bubble would be a flop, a cynical, anodyne exercise to harvest the pay cheques from the TV companies.

<p>Firms trying to rebuild after lockdown are being plunged into more uncertainty by this incompetent government</p><p>When Boris Johnson sold Brexit to the British electorate in 2016, his pledge was that it would be “frictionless”. Just how monumental this deceit was is now becoming apparent.</p><p>You cannot leave a single market across a frictionless border – and you never could. Today the minister for the cabinet office, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/michaelgove">Michael Gove</a>, and home secretary, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/priti-patel">Priti Patel</a>, were forced to spell out this reality.

He wants a giant holding pen in Kent – a Nightingale car park? – probably matched by others meeting WTO anti-smuggling standards in East Anglia and along the south coast. Since Johnson could not deny Northern Ireland continued membership of the EU single market, the same will apply to trade across the Irish Sea.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/13/the-tories-latest-brexit-plans-expose-frictionless-trade-as-a-fiction">Continue reading...</a>

## Is the word 'Macbeth' really cursed?

<p>This week, we investigate how Shakespeare’s 17th-century tragedy became emblematic of theatre’s ultimate superstition</p><p>Thespians are a seriously superstitious bunch. Most know not to say good luck to an actor but there is So Much More: never leave the stage completely dark; never whistle in the theatre; never use a peacock feather on stage; never knit in the wings; and don’t even think about walking out of the dressing room right foot first. Perhaps the most notorious superstition surrounds the word “Macbeth”, which should not – except during a live performance – be uttered inside the theatre. In fact, the superstition is so deeply embedded that there is no sign for the word “Macbeth” in British Sign Language. To get round this “deadly” issue, actors refer to Macbeth as “The Scottish Play” or “The Bard’s Play”.</p><p>But is there any basis to this long-standing superstition? When Macbeth premiered circa 1606, King James I was on the English throne – and James was not a fan of witches. The execution of James’s mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, was said to have inspired a long-lasting obsession with the dark arts, one compounded after the king was caught in a brutal storm at sea when he was king of Scotland. Convinced that witches were to blame, James ordered a witch-hunt on his return home and swiftly wrote a book, Daemonologie, where he outlined his plans to root out witchcraft for good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/13/is-the-word-macbeth-really-cursed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Scores of women are publishing details of their relationships with the Transmetropolitan writer, who they say offered mentorship in exchange for sexual contact. But they don’t want him cancelled – they want a conversation</p><p>‘Stories are what make us human,” comics writer Warren Ellis <a href="http://www.warrenellis.com/stories-drinking-and-the-world/">told an audience</a> on 28 April 2005, as that year’s Toronto Comic-Con began. “They’re an advanced form of play. Cats have play. Sometimes very sophisticated, dramatised forms of play. But they’re not communicated or externalised. So far, only humans use stories to dramatise the way they see the world.”</p><p>Two days after that, on 30 April, a 23-year-old woman flew to the convention to surprise Ellis, whom she believed was her boyfriend. The pair had spoken on video chat and email regularly since they first met online in 2004, with some of their conversations lasting through the night. She alleges that Ellis, then 37, never told her that he had a long-term partner, and that he had asked her to keep their relationship secret because of his fame. They had sex in his hotel room that evening.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/13/women-speak-out-about-warren-ellis-transmetropolitan">Continue reading...</a>

## Kelly Preston: a classy actor who graduated from teen-movie roles to darker and funnier parts

<p>After starting out with romantic-interest characters, Preston evolved into a smart, subversive performer – most notably in the hit romcom Jerry Maguire</p><p>In some ways, Kelly Preston’s most famous role was the one outside the movies: as John Travolta’s wife. They married in 1991 and became probably the most devotedly uxorious Hollywood couple since Joanne Woodward and Paul Newman. Preston and Travolta have a great sexy-funny dance routine together in the 1989 comedy The Experts, which is how they met. Preston put her acting career on hold for some of the 90s while she and Travolta started a family: having two sons, Jett and Benjamin, and a daughter, Ella. Heart-rendingly, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/05/john-travolta-son-grief">Jett died of a seizure at the age of 16</a>, a memory that adds a new layer of sadness to today’s news, and a new layer of sombre reflection about the great pressures that a woman in public life is expected to undergo.</p><p>In her 20s, Preston got sexy supporting-cast Hollywood roles in movies such as the 1988 box-office smash Twins, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito as the bizarrely un-similar titular siblings. Preston played Marnie, the woman who marries Schwarzenegger’s gentle giant while Chloe Webb played her twin sister Linda, who is paired off with wisecracking DeVito. It is a measure of the sexist stereotyping of Hollywood that while the men are supposed to be hilariously different, she and Webb are the non-twins playing regular twins with 80s big hair, basically indistinguishable not just from each other but all the other “sexy” roles that Hollywood compels its female stars to fit into. Two years earlier, she had been in a quintessentially 80s teen comedy Mischief – the kind of movie which lived endlessly on in VHS rental outlets throughout the world – playing the hot blonde fantasy object of the shy adolescent boy.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/13/kelly-preston-a-classy-actor-who-graduated-from-teen-movie-roles-to-darker-and-funnier-parts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mallika Basu’s stupendous murgh masala can be tweaked to your heart’s content so it changes to suit you - wherever you are</p><p>The shutters remain down for some <em>trattorie</em>, restaurants and bars; padlocks remind us of how things were just under a month ago, how difficult things still are.

The 8.30pm breeze is respite after a white-hot day.</p><p>The Kumar family opened the restaurant in 2000, 20 years ago this September, naming it after their home city in the northern Indian State of Rajasthan. We have been sitting at their tables for 14 years, thanks to a recommendation from Vincenzo’s friend Alessandra, which means she always comes up in conversation whenever we come here – one of the many acknowledgements that link people, places and meals in a matrix of memory.

It’s probable that the footage I watched, sometime in the early 2000s, was in a roundup of “the most shocking festival moments, ever”. But it’s certain that I’d have wanted to be there, devil-horning and ducking the crimson missile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/13/l7-reading-1992-iconic-festival-sets-flying-tampon-donita-sparks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Parallel dream worlds open up, inanimate objects come to life: as a new Buñuel biopic shows, there are no rules to the medium</p><p>You wouldn’t mistake the new Spanish animation Buñuel in the Labyrinth of Turtles for a Pixar movie. Not unless your children enjoy seeing heads ripped off live chickens and donkeys getting stung to death by bees. It is a chronicle of Luis Buñuel’s time making his 1933 documentary Las Hurdes, and his struggle to define himself as a film-maker following his split from Salvador Dalí. In terms of Buñuel’s career, the rest is history, but Buñuel in the Labyrinth of Turtles is a reminder of how well-suited animation and surrealism are. They go together like a lobster and a telephone.</p><p>Early animators certainly recognised the potential. Around the time Buñuel and Dalí were slicing up eyeballs in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/may/29/lage-dor-bunuel-chien-andalou-philip-french">Un Chien Andalou</a>, innovators such as Max Fleischer were toying with the reality-warping potential of the medium. Looking at his 1930s Betty Boop cartoons, you can’t believe LSD hadn’t been invented yet. Parallel dream worlds open up, inanimate objects come to life, and the laws of physics are in thrall to the rhythm of the jazz. Surrealism found a safe haven in Looney Tunes and Hanna-Barbera, and even Disney, who in 1945 collaborated with Dalí himself on an extremely Dalí-esque, animation called Destino (which was not finished until 2003).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/13/surrealism-and-animation-they-go-together-like-a-lobster-telephone-bunuel-and-the-labyrinth-of-turtles">Continue reading...</a>

Once an experiment is complete, mice are typically rendered extraneous since they can no longer be used as a control, and are humanely euthanized.

Financial markets face risks of sovereign default.</p><p>While some ad hoc relief has already been promised by official creditors, indebted poor countries are again facing private creditors without a sovereign-debt restructuring mechanism – the global equivalent of a bankruptcy regime.

As a new documentary Spaceship Earth tells their story, we meet the ‘biospherians’</p><p>It sounds like a sci-fi movie, or the weirdest series of Big Brother ever.

Running from 1991 to 1993, it is remembered as a failure, if it is remembered at all – a hubristic, pseudo-scientific experiment that was never going to accomplish its mission. However, as the new documentary Spaceship Earth shows, the escapade is a cautionary tale, now that the outside world – Biosphere 1, if you prefer – is itself coming to resemble an apocalyptic sci-fi world. Looking back, it’s amazing that Biosphere 2 even happened at all, not least because the people behind it started out as a hippy theatre group.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/13/spaceship-earth-arizona-biosphere-2-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>
