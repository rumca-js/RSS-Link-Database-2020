In this video, Persia talks about a new update coming this October to Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. The update includes a variety of things like a new video clip sharing system, new costumes for Wolf, and two boss-related modes. Reflection of Strength allows you to fight past foes without replaying the story by visiting Sculptor's Idols, and Gauntlet of Strength is a boss rush mode that only gives you one life.

Persia also goes over this morning's Avengers War Table livestream, which showcased the upcoming beta. The beta will have four playable characters, HARM challenge rooms, and Warzone and Drop Zone missions, all of which you can play solo or with friends. HARM Challenge Rooms have increasingly difficult waves of enemies, Warzones are repeatable missions that can last from 10 minutes to 2 hours, and Drop Zones are more quick encounters. Hawkeye was officially announced as part of the game's post-launch roster, and more characters are on the way in future updates. 

On the topic of new characters, Valorant announced Killjoy after recent leaks. Killjoy's abilities vary from stealth mines, to mini turrets, to an Alarmbot that functions much like Raze's bot. Her ultimate ability creates a dome around a designated area that detains any enemies within its radius. 

Don't forget that we're approaching the final month of our Play For All donation drive. You can also visit store.gamespot.com to purchase merch. All proceeds will go towards Black Lives Matter and COVID-19 relief efforts. 

This is your Save State for Wednesday, July 29th.

Along with Gullivarrr, Pascal has also joined Animal Crossing: New Horizons in the first of two summer updates. In this video, we show off the entire mermaid set that you can get from Pascal when you give him scallops that you find when deep seas diving. All of Pascal's mermaid furniture will come in the form of a DIY recipe that can be crafted with shells that you find on your beach and pearls that you find at the bottom of the sea. Beside the furniture, Pascal will also give you two types of mermaid dresses, shoes, and a tiara. You will even have a chance of getting a pearl from Pascal, too. Pascal will show up on your island at least once a day when you catch a scallop from the ocean. He doesn't always arrive on the first scallop of the day, so don't stop diving until you see him! Below is the full list of mermaid items and if you comment your favorite, you could win all of the furniture in the mermaid set!
