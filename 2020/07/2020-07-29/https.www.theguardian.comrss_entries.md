<p>From artisan cheeses to king scallops, lockdown has left high-quality British produce looking for a home. Here’s what to do with it </p><p>Coronavirus was an earthquake for British food and drink producers. With restaurants, pubs and office canteens shut, exports disrupted and Britons hoarding for lockdown, mismatches in supply chains were created, along with<strong> </strong>temporary shortages and huge gluts of surplus produce. All this meant farmers, fishermen and processors needed to find new retail opportunities.</p><p>The aftershocks are still reverberating. Lockdown is easing, but British food is far from back to normal. From supermarkets selling seafood once destined for Michelin-starred restaurants to artisan cheesemakers offloading stock on waste-food apps, British producers are desperate for your support. For shoppers, there are bargains to be had. But which products are affected by surpluses? And what exciting things can you do with these ingredients?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/29/michelin-quality-food-aldi-prices-lockdown-how-make-most-summer-surplus-british-produce">Continue reading...</a>

## Surviving Autocracy by Masha Gessen review – with Trump, there is no shared reality

<p>Media failings and the methods of tyrants ... an original and piercing account of how the Trump presidency works, drawing on personal experience of Russia</p><p>During the past few years of Donald Trump’s deranged presidency, if there is one writer I turn to it is Masha Gessen, whose piercing clarity is gemlike and refusal to equivocate precious. Their ability – Gessen is non–binary/trans and uses they/them pronouns – is surely to do with their Russian American background. As a journalist, Gessen has covered Russia, Hungary and Israel, so is not experiencing illiberalism for the first time. Instead of a weariness however, what is present in the book is a stunning capacity to connect the dots in a way that few can.</p><p><em>Surviving Autocracy</em> is about the Trump phenomenon and how it has transformed US society. It is about what he has learned from Vladimir Putin, among other autocrats he admires. It is also one of the few analytical books to suggest plausible ways he might be stopped. Anti-Trump polemics tend to rely on satire (which has proved useless) or putting the case for ignoring him (impossible), or relying on on some vague essence of American justice to suddenly come charging in.

Different types of mask offer different levels of protection. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against Covid-19 infection, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. So even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested such masks should be reserved for health workers or those at particularly high risk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/29/what-kind-of-face-mask-best-protects-against-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

The UK was initially complacent about the virus, and several individuals first likened Covid-19 to a “bad flu”, perhaps because influenza was the most recent point of reference for a widespread infectious disease in richer countries. But even flu, which <a href="https://fullfact.org/health/coronavirus-compare-influenza/">killed an average</a> of 17,000 people annually in England between 2014-15 and 2018-19, has a tough time being taken seriously in the UK.</p><p>That could all change. Britain learned the painful way that infectious disease outbreaks can devastate public health and the economy if not controlled properly. The strong state responses seen in east Asian countries are partly the result of their recent experiences. South Korea, <a href="https://www.who.int/westernpacific/emergencies/2015-mers-outbreak">which learned from its 2015 Mers outbreak</a>, was far better prepared for Covid-19. Indeed, South Korea has recorded 299 deaths among a population of 51 million. Taiwan, where 37 people died of Sars in 2002, <a href="https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/-taiwan-s-sars-experience-helped-it-beat-covid-19-/1830547">drew on its previous experience</a> to swiftly contain coronavirus; it has counted seven Covid-19 deaths in a population of 23 million.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/29/coronavirus-britain-infectious-diseases-flu-community">Continue reading...</a>

## Lana Del Rey's poetry debut review – sometimes cliche, always solipsistic

<p>Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass, released as an audiobook this week and in print in September, is a reminder of the singer’s strengths and shortcomings</p><p>Lana Del Rey has a decided aesthetic: a kitsch, drag queen femininity, always heartbroken, always nostalgic for 1950s California. From early albums such as Born to Die and Ultraviolence, to her latest Norman Fucking Rockwell!, all her music sounds kind of the same. I’m OK with that; it’s camp, it’s silly, it’s a mood.</p><p>When her debut poetry collection, Violet Bent Backwards Over the Grass, was announced, I wasn’t surprised that Del Rey had poetic aspirations. In her 2019 song, hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have – but I have it, Del Rey refers to herself “tearing around in my fucking nightgown / a 24-7 Sylvia Plath”. This is the fun of her work, combining high Americana (in Young and Beautiful) with a lackadaisical, millennial nihilism (see Fucked My Way Up to the Top).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/29/lana-del-rey-poetry-debut-review-violet-bent-backwards-over-the-grass">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 2.5mph pace of a narrowboat on the Shropshire Union canal makes for a blissful trip, with few other humans but wildlife galore</p><p>‘Heron ahead!” Up went the cry and we were transfixed as we glided towards this latter-day pterodactyl standing motionless on the canal bank. Then a sudden flurry. In the space of a few seconds it had plunged forward, plucked a fish from the water and swallowed it in a single gulp. Well, that’s to say the flapping fish <em>disappeared</em> after a single gulp. As it was somewhat on the large side, it took several more shakes of the heron’s neck for the unfortunate prey to make its final descent into the dark.</p><p>Over five days on the Shropshire Union Canal we had so many close encounters with herons – 30 … 40? – we lost count, and it became evident that they were as integral to the scenery as the fields, woods, hedges, wharfs and canalside pubs our hired narrowboat floated past.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/29/narrowboat-boating-break-shropshire-union-canal-uk-wildlife">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amid the anger over Wiley’s bigoted tirade, let’s not forget the newspapers that have been peddling prejudice for years<br /></p><p>Twitter is simultaneously many things: a means of elevating otherwise ignored voices, a platform for facilitating debate, a portal to access a bewildering array of information – and a cesspit of hatred.</p><p>This weekend, the grime artist Wiley – with his half a million followers – unleashed a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/25/wileys-management-firm-drops-grime-artist-over-antisemitic-tweets">tirade of undiluted antisemitism</a> on to the site over the course of two days, leading some to observe a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jul/27/chief-rabbi-facebook-twitter-antisemitism-complicity-wiley">48-hour boycott</a> of the social media platform to protest Twitter’s slowness to act.

The <a href="https://www.iswa.org/">International Solid Waste Association</a> estimates that single-use plastic has grown by up to 300% in the US. Some of it is necessary for now – the disposable personal protective equipment (PPE) that health and care workers use, for instance – but for the rest of us, if we are to live with this pandemic for the foreseeable future, it’s probably time to get into better habits.

Sheeran said that he had been reading Elton John’s autobiography and saw a lot of his behaviour reflected in it. “There are so many things that he did that I do. He would be like: ‘I would just go on an ice-cream binge and eat four fucking desserts until I threw up,’ and I was like: ‘I’ve done that before.’”</p><p>I have done that before, too: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/03/moment-that-changed-me-hair-loss-anorexia">I lost several years of my life to anorexia</a> and bulimia.
