Limited sample memory can be a drag, but there's a trick that can help.
Resample your samples at higher speed and pitch before importing them, then slow them down in the sampler. I'll show you how in this video.

UPDATE! My packs are now Circuit Tracks compatible! Check your purchase on Gumroad to get a new download. Also, I've made a mega pack for Circuit Tracks that includes packs 1 and 2 plus new sample content! Get that here: https://redmeansrecording.gumroad.com/l/rmr_ctracks_01
