But in the late 1800\u2019s and early 1900\u2019s, China was defeated by the British, French, Japan, Russia and was put to shame on the world stage for over 100 years.\n\nBecause of all this shame and disgrace, you\u2019ve grown to resent not just the West, but the rest of the East, the North, the South.\n\nWe need a new plan of attack, where we don\u2019t have to go head first into America\u2019s greatest strength and our main weakness. No longer \u201cusing force to compel\u201d the enemy to your will, but rather by using all means.\n\nMake the West believe that you support free trade and globalization, while systematically taking advantage of it. You tell other countries like the US to say \u201cno!\u201d to protectionism, tariffs. China\u2019s main strategy and advantage over the US is the ability to think in decades and centuries. The US on the other hand has grown weak and comfortable.\n\nChina\u2019s economic power is the glue that holds the house of cards together. China has complete control over the economy. All this economic power allows us to move onto other fronts of this new cold war.\n\nInfrastructure is one of the most important aspects of a society. Within China, we\u2019re focused on making our economy completely independent from the outside world, where we\u2019re not dependent on exports or imports.\n\nWhile we\u2019re making our infrastructure most robust at home, this is where the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, comes in.\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
