This Friday, July 31, rock band Fontaines D.C. will release their new album, "A Hero's Death," on Partisan Records.

Watch three songs from that amazing show, recorded live at the Barracuda in Austin, Texas, in March 2019.

July 30, 2020: Taylor Swift isn't an 'independent artist' in the conventional sense, but her new album 'folklore' was assembled remotely with indie artists like Aaron Dessner and Justin Vernon. From Nur-D to Charli XCX, everyone's going DIY these days. Will this become the new normal?
