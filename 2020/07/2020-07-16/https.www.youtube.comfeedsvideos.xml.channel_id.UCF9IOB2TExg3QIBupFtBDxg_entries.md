COVID-19 will probably be a long-term feature of people’s lives

‘There’s a very high likelihood that come winter, we will see an increase in cases’

“And I think it’s quite probable that we will see this virus coming back in different waves over a number of years.”

A fresh spike in cases later this year would still be part of the first wave

“All we have done is suppress the first wave and when you take the brakes off, you would expect it to come back.”

Chris Whitty

Viral circulation, “winter and into next spring”

Professor Jonathan Van-Tam

(England’s deputy chief medical officer)

“The reality is, until we get a vaccine, and only if we get a vaccine that is really capable of suppressing disease levels, will we ever be ‘out of this’

“From that perspective, we may have to live, and learn to live, with this virus in the long-term. Certainly for many months to come, if not years.”

DCD director (Robert Redfield)

Vaccine appeared to offer the type of protection seen in a natural infection

Theoretically, the best vaccine you could possibly ever get is a natural infection (Fauci)

Moderna’s candidate has had millions of dollars in backing from Operation Warp Speed

“I feel good about the projected timetable.”

Fauci, “What we’re doing with vaccines, therapeutics, clinical trials is the real substance”

Rashes had been reported, China and Europe in hospitalised patients

Study to systematically gather data about skin rashes in milder cases in the wider population

Viral skin rashes, (Dr Veronique Bataille)

“Many viral infections can affect the skin, so it’s not surprising that we are seeing these rashes in COVID-19,” 

“However, it is important that people know that in some cases, a rash may be the first or only symptom of the disease

So if you notice a new rash, you should take it seriously by self-isolating and getting tested as soon as possible.”

Study initial findings

336,000 regular UK app users

8.8% of people reporting a positive coronavirus swab test had experienced a skin rash as part of their symptoms

Also, rash reported in a further 8.2% of users with cough, fever or anosmia 

5.4% of people with a negative test result

To investigate further

Images and information from 12,000 people

17% of respondents testing positive for coronavirus reported a rash as the first symptom of the disease

21% of those confirmed as being infected with coronavirus, the rash was their only symptom

Rashes, three categories 

Hive-type rash (urticaria)

Raised bumps on the skin which come and go quite quickly (hours) and are usually very itchy

Can involve any part of the body

Often starts with intense itching of the palms or soles

Can cause swelling of the lips and eyelids

These rashes can present quite early on in the infection, but can also last a long time afterwards

Prickly heat or chickenpox-type rash

Erythemato-papular or erythemato-vesicular rash

Areas of small, itchy red bumps that can occur anywhere on the body

Particularly the elbows and knees, back of the hands and feet

The rash can persist for days or weeks.

COVID fingers and toes (chillblains)

Reddish and purplish bumps on the fingers or toes

May be sore but not usually itchy

This type of rash is most specific to COVID-19

More common in younger people

Tends to present later on

Dr Justine Kluk 

“These findings highlight the importance of keeping an eye on any new changes in your skin, such as lumps, bumps or rashes. 

Early reporting of COVID-associated rashes by members of the public and recognition of their significance by frontline healthcare practitioners

May increase the detection of coronavirus infections and help to stop the spread.” 

Dr Tanya Bleiker, President, British Association of Dermatologists

“Documenting the skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 is an important piece of the puzzle in building our understanding of the disease.

Skin symptoms may play a crucial role in detecting infection in people who are otherwise asymptomatic."

We’re delighted to be working with the team at KCL to make an image library of COVID-19 skin manifestations accessible on a dedicated website. 

This will help healthcare professionals guide their decision making in clinical settings

and may have a role in educating the public about skin symptoms which would warrant self-isolation.”
