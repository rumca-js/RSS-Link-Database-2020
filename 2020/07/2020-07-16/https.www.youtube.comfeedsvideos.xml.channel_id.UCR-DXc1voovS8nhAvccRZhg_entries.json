Well, sort of.\n\nEben Upton said on the first episode of The Pi Cast that the next Raspberry Pi Compute Module could support NVMe storage using a PCIe 1x lane, and talked about some of the things that could be coming in the next Pi Foundation hardware.\n\nI'll discuss what that means, and why NVMe storage is different than typical SATA SSD drives, and what that all means for people who want to use them in Raspberry Pis.\n\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\n\nThe Pi Cast Episode - AMA with Eben Upton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTJ5eLn58to\nPi Cluster Episode 1: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgVz4-SEhbE\nmicroSD card benchmarks: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2019/raspberry-pi-microsd-card-performance-comparison-2019\nUASP Pi 4 performance comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0kYcM1E5fY\n\n#RaspberryPi #NVMe", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yTyhR0Adao", "date_published": "2020-07-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
