in the wider population\n\nViral skin rashes, (Dr Veronique Bataille)\n\n\u201cMany viral infections can affect the skin, so it\u2019s not surprising that we are seeing these rashes in COVID-19,\u201d \n\n\u201cHowever, it is important that people know that in some cases, a rash may be the first or only symptom of the disease\n\nSo if you notice a new rash, you should take it seriously by self-isolating and getting tested as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nStudy initial findings\n\n336,000 regular UK app users\n\n8.8% of people reporting a positive coronavirus swab test had experienced a skin rash as part of their symptoms\n\nAlso, rash reported in a further 8.2% of users with cough, fever or anosmia \n\n5.4% of people with a negative test result\n\nTo investigate further\n\nImages and information from 12,000 people\n\n17% of respondents testing positive for coronavirus reported a rash as the first symptom of the disease\n\n21% of those confirmed as being infected with coronavirus, the rash was their only symptom\n\nRashes, three categories \n\nHive-type rash (urticaria)\n\nRaised bumps on the skin which come and go quite quickly (hours) and are usually very itchy\n\nCan involve any part of the body\n\nOften starts with intense itching of the palms or soles\n\nCan cause swelling of the lips and eyelids\n\nThese rashes can present quite early on in the infection, but can also last a long time afterwards\n\nPrickly heat or chickenpox-type rash\n\nErythemato-papular or erythemato-vesicular rash\n\nAreas of small, itchy red bumps that can occur anywhere on the body\n\nParticularly the elbows and knees, back of the hands and feet\n\nThe rash can persist for days or weeks.\n\nCOVID fingers and toes (chillblains)\n\nReddish and purplish bumps on the fingers or toes\n\nMay be sore but not usually itchy\n\nThis type of rash is most specific to COVID-19\n\nMore common in younger people\n\nTends to present later on\n\nDr Justine Kluk \n\n\u201cThese findings highlight the importance of keeping an eye on any new changes in your skin, such as lumps, bumps or rashes. \n\nEarly reporting of COVID-associated rashes by members of the public and recognition of their significance by frontline healthcare practitioners\n\nMay increase the detection of coronavirus infections and help to stop the spread.\u201d \n\nDr Tanya Bleiker, President, British Association of Dermatologists\n\n\u201cDocumenting the skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 is an important piece of the puzzle in building our understanding of the disease.\n\nSkin symptoms may play a crucial role in detecting infection in people who are otherwise asymptomatic.\"\n\nWe\u2019re delighted to be working with the team at KCL to make an image library of COVID-19 skin manifestations accessible on a dedicated website. \n\nThis will help healthcare professionals guide their decision making in clinical settings\n\nand may have a role in educating the public about skin symptoms which would warrant self-isolation.\u201d", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeKDzwhi8nw", "date_published": "2020-07-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false,
