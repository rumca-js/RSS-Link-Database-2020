<ul><li>Woods signs for one-under 71 in first round after five months out</li><li>Tony Finau tops leaderboard with 66 in Ohio</li></ul><p>A round of attrition was not exactly what Tiger Woods desired in his return to competitive golf after a five month break but blustery conditions at the Memorial Tournament delivered precisely that. US Open met PGA Tour in Ohio.</p><p>A day otherwise notable for a 423-yard Bryson DeChambeau drive looked set to belong to Woods as he raced to two under par inside three holes. Given the 15-times major champion’s lack of tournament play, a subsequent regression was not altogether surprising. “Tiger’s just not sharp,” observed the watching Jack Nicklaus. Still, Woods’s one under par 71 was impressive given the context. A birdie at the 18th sent Woods to the scoring tent with a smile.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jul/16/tiger-woods-holds-his-own-on-tricky-return-at-the-memorial-tournament">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The chief scientific adviser made clear that what the government did with his advice was not on him</p><p>Yesterday Boris Johnson committed himself to a public inquiry into the government’s handling of the coronavirus. He didn’t say when, though he gave the distinct impression that the ideal time would be a long way into the future. By when he would have had time to line up any number of patsies to take the rap for his own failures. One of whom is sure to be the government’s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance.</p><p>It’s fair to say that Vallance has been a little slow off the mark right from the very start of the pandemic. Not so much with the science – though he’s hardly excelled at that – but with PR management. For a long time, he was under the impressions that his prime role was to provide the government with independent scientific advice; it’s only over the course of the last few weeks he’s realised his real function was to be a human shield for Boris. And he’s clearly not happy about having been suckered in this way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jul/16/tired-of-being-boris-johnsons-patsy-patrick-vallance-fights-back">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leeds United are so close to the promised land now that they could be a Premier League team again before kicking another ball. This victory leaves them needing just a point to clinch promotion, and though there may be a repeat of last season’s feistiness when they go to Derby on Sunday in search of it, there is every possibility that West Bromwich Albion or Brentford will have blinked first in the meantime.</p><p>As it stands Leeds are five points clear with two games remaining, so something cataclysmic will need to happen to prevent a return to the top flight after 16 years, even if there have been false dawns before and Derby and Charlton might not be the opponents Marcelo Bielsa would choose at such a nervy stage of the season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jul/16/leeds-barnsley-championship-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

They have been defined by the European Cup for so long that La Liga often feels like an afterthought.

A tenth win tonight, at home to Villarreal, would clinch a 34th La Liga title.</p><p>It would also be only their third in the last 12 seasons. They’ve won the Champions League more often in that time, a confusing statgasm that reflects the unique identity of the club. The Champions League will be harder to win this year, given their 2-1 defeat at home to Manchester City in the first leg of their last-16 match, but a lot has changed since then and it would silly to rule them out. Especially with Zinedine Zidane in charge. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2020/jul/16/real-madrid-v-villarreal-la-liga-live">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Julian Lewis: better a maverick than a poodle

<p>MPs were right to defy Downing Street by choosing the Tory rightwinger to chair the intelligence and security committee </p><p>Julian Lewis and Chris Grayling are a pair of dyed-in-the-wool rightwing Conservative leaver MPs. On issues like Brexit, their politics are as indistinguishable as Tweedledum and Tweedledee. Yet Mr Lewis’s surprise victory over Mr Grayling in the election to chair parliament’s <a href="http://isc.independent.gov.uk/" title="">intelligence and security committee</a> on Wednesday is not a plague-on-both-your-Tory-houses result. On the contrary, it is the sort of outcome that even parliament’s most trenchant leftwingers and remainers could scarce forbear to cheer. For Mr Lewis is a rightwing maverick, while Mr Grayling is a rightwing poodle. Mr Lewis’s win is one in the eye against No 10, the whips and the payroll vote. It should unite all those on every side of politics, and of all parties, who want MPs in parliament, not Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings, to make the decisions that matter.</p><p>The committee was first set up in 1994 by a Conservative prime minister, John Major, who respected parliament. Its powers were enhanced in 2013 by another Conservative, David Cameron, who shared that respect. Over the years it has become more confident as a result. Boris Johnson, by contrast, has little respect for parliament, no desire for accountability, despises checks and balances, and is vindictive towards those who disagree with him, especially on Brexit. His attitude to the committee has been the polar opposite of respectful, not least because it was chaired, until 2019, by the independent and scrupulous former attorney general Dominic Grieve, a staunch remainer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/the-guardian-view-on-julian-lewis-better-a-maverick-than-a-poodle">Continue reading...</a>

Singer-songwriter with Fairport Convention who went on to success in the duo Trader Horne<p>Judy Dyble, who has died aged 71, was the first female singer with the English folk-rock pioneers Fairport Convention. She was already singing in north London folk clubs, accompanying herself on the autoharp, when in 1967 she was invited to join the Muswell Hill-based band, whose members included Ashley Hutchings, who had been at the same school as Dyble, Richard Thompson, her boyfriend at the time, and Simon Nicol. Throughout her career, Dyble sang in her natural speaking voice, with clear diction and without affectation.</p><p>Fairport Convention were initially influenced by American musicians such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/jonimitchell" title="">Joni Mitchell</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan" title="">Bob Dylan</a>, rather than by the British folk songs that came later, and their first, eponymous album, released later that year – the only one that featured Dyble – included two at-the-time unreleased songs from Mitchell, one of them <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m_xRdrfbwk" title="">Chelsea Morning</a>. The album also featured <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWKoNqFlTQA" title="">Portfolio</a>, written by Dyble and Hutchings. Live performances in London, including at the American record producer Joe Boyd’s UFO Club, were characterised by Dyble knitting on stage; she knitted while Thompson and Jimi Hendrix jammed at the Speakeasy Club. Boyd became the band’s manager but was anxious for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/sandy-denny" title="">Sandy Denny</a> to replace Dyble, who left in 1968.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/16/judy-dyble-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

## Until the EU tackles tax avoidance, big companies will keep getting away with it | Aidan Regan

<p>Ireland may not have given Apple illegal state aid, but the system still needs to change</p><p>What happens when a European member state such as Ireland or the Netherlands decides it wants to act like a corporate tax haven? Because taxation is a national sovereignty issue, the European commission can’t directly challenge the corporate tax laws of EU member states. So the commission has instead been trying to use state aid laws to prevent tax avoidance in smaller countries. This bundle of rules is designed to promote market competition and prevent countries giving unfair advantages to companies. In the eyes of the commission, allowing a company to avoid taxes is much like giving it a cash subsidy.</p><p>In 2016, the European commission found that Apple had <a href="http://economic-incentives.blogspot.com/2016/03/apple-sales-internationalby-numbers.html">transferred around €110bn of sales</a> from their European operations to a head office of two subsidiaries in Ireland. These subsidiaries were registered in Ireland, but were non-resident for tax purposes – so Apple’s profits in Irish accounts weren’t taxed.

<p>Dancers are taking tentative steps back to work, giving socially distanced performances outdoors in Germany, France and the Czech Republic</p><p>T<a href="https://www.stuttgart-ballet.de/company/tamas-detrich/">amas Detrich</a>, director of Germany’s <a href="https://www.stuttgart-ballet.de/">Stuttgart Ballet</a>, had been planning two big programmes of modern ballet for the summer season when the coronavirus crisis hit. “We were on tour, and had to return to Stuttgart,” he remembers. “Then one of our company tested positive. We shut down the whole ballet and went into quarantine. During those first two weeks, we still had around 10 known cases of coronavirus.” The experience clearly still haunts him, and it’s a scenario that he never wants to return to. His steps back towards live performance have been cautious.</p><p>While dance in the UK remains in effective lockdown, productions in Germany and other European countries are tentatively resuming. Detrich’s dancers continued training as much as possible from their homes. In April, he got permission to consider the dancers as equivalent to professional athletes, who were permitted to train in small groups. Classes returned to the studio, but regulations stipulated nine metres’ physical distancing. A full class might be three people in a studio.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/16/bouncing-back-european-dance-is-kick-started-with-huge-state-support">Continue reading...</a>

And beneath its streets are the bodies of innumerable plague victims. One in particular haunts me. Holbein died in London, almost certainly of plague, in 1543. The long shadow of bubonic plague permeates his art, in its danse macabre of corpses and skeletons. It seemed appropriate to seek out this master of pestilence in a time of pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/16/bones-hans-holbein-lockdown-arts-grisliest-mystery-plague-london-renaissance">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Made with the help of her dad on a caravan park, the roots of this sexual psychodrama ended up being an awakening for the director herself </p><p>A few years ago, the writer-director Claire Oakley wrote a script for a short film, based on one of her dreams. “It was just a girl, following another girl, through some streets in a foreign town,” she explains, via Zoom, from her home in east London. She submitted it to a writers’ scheme and was accepted on to a retreat in Croatia with 20 other writer-directors, all of whom had to read each other’s work. “This guy came up to me on the first day, and said: ‘Oh, so you’re a lesbian, then.’ And I was like: what? He thought the work was about female desire. And I didn’t know what he was talking about, thought he was really weird, and didn’t speak to him for the rest of the week.” At the time, Oakley explains, she was in a heterosexual relationship. “I was actually married to a man.”</p><p>She is now married to a woman. Back in Croatia, the thought had “not ever really popped into my conscious mind”, and the short film was never made. “I could never figure out what was happening, or why she was following someone, so it never came to fruition,” she says. “Then about five years passed, and things changed in my life, and I came out, and during all that, I thought back to him, and his interpretation of that piece of work, and realised that maybe he’d been completely right.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/16/make-up-director-claire-oakley-i-was-worried-people-might-think-we-were-making-a-porno">Continue reading...</a>

From February that year, Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee’s reggaeton single climbed with the mercury from No 88 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart to No 1, where it sat, unchallenged, for a record-tying four months. It wasn’t just the song of that summer: “It was the biggest song of probably all the summers,” jokes the singer-songwriter Poo Bear, who put together the smash-hit remix featuring Justin Bieber.</p><p>By this point in the year, the song of the summer is usually obvious. “It’s the song you hear at a bar, in a club, coming out of a car, or in a grocery store,” says Hanif Abdurraqib, a poet and cultural critic based in Ohio. But in 2020, the race has been disrupted by coronavirus. In lockdown, says Abdurraqib, “there’s no mechanism where a song could come on and you could see a mass of people rushing to revel in it”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/16/how-the-chaos-of-2020-changed-the-song-of-the-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s the simple things that give me pleasure while cooking – and even improve my sense of wellbeing</p><p>After another shapeless, meandering day of working from home, trying to read the entire internet by way of displacement activity, I know exactly what I need to help me destress: a cucumber and a teaspoon. I head to the kitchen and peel the cucumber in long downward strokes, attempting to get each ribbon off in one, itself a victory of sorts. Then I slice it vertically in two. Now I take my teaspoon and run it with extreme prejudice straight down the vegetable’s central canal to remove the seeds. I watch the watery mush fracture and roll away to leave the pristine, scooped-out hollow. I do this to the other half. And breathe. God, but it’s satisfying. Sometimes I make cucumber salad just so I can deseed a cucumber with a teaspoon, rather than the other way round.</p><p>I have never been quite as aware of my charmed life as I am during the current crisis. I have a home, a garden, a job and a family that doesn’t seem to hate me, or at least who hide it well enough if they do. But I also have another benefit. I like cooking, which is helpful <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/18/oven-chips-pork-belly-spaghetti-i-am-the-lockdown-recipe-king" title="">given how much of that we’ve all had to do</a>.

My son’s been a boy who, unprompted, says, “Dad, I love you” and wraps me in the tightest of hugs. Who, when he’s seen his sister after a long absence, almost tackles her with glee. Who’s still apt to let a deluge go on account of hurt feelings. In plenty of explicit ways, he’s my emotional opposite, a boy who showed me how to embrace; who, along with his sister, softened parts of me that my own boyhood had hardened; a kid who’s been instrumental in ushering me as close to comfortable with physical expressions of love as I have been in all my almost 45 years of life.</p><p>What kind of father was I that I was scared to receive my flesh and blood?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/16/the-power-of-touch-when-my-son-visited-in-lockdown-we-couldnt-hug-it-was-a-reminder-of-the-saddest-truth">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The newspaper Bild has long poured vitriol on the country’s left-wingers and ‘do gooders’. But now it has a new target: the chancellor. By Thomas Meaney</p><p>‘It would be ideal if you could hit a deer,” Julian Reichelt, editor-in-chief of Europe’s largest tabloid, Bild Zeitung, told his chauffeur. “Guardian readers could do with a bit more colour.” We had reached escape velocity out of ice-encrusted Düsseldorf. The Mercedes S-Class locked into place like a bobsled on the Autobahn. I sat shotgun with Reichelt’s assortment of sports gear, a hockey stick between my legs. “We are lucky in our driver today,” Reichelt said, deadpan. “Last time we hit a wild boar and the boar and the car went flying.”</p><p>I was travelling with Reichelt on one of his publicity tours across Germany. For the past two years, he has made an appointment once a month to commune with groups of Bild’s 1.3 million readers. “You have to feel their emotions,” he told me from the backseat. “You have to listen to their hearts.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/16/bild-zeitung-tabloid-julian-reichelt-angela-merkel-germany">Continue reading...</a>

She was denied bail and will remain in custody, following lengthy arguments in which<strong> </strong>prosecutors painted her as a flight risk. The court also heard testimony from accusers. Prosecutors read a statement from one of Maxwell’s accusers, identified as Jane Doe. Maxwell, the statement said, “enjoyed drawing her victims in with perceived caring”. The same accuser described Maxwell’s “sociopathic manner”. Maxwell has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Her lawyers have said she “vigorously denies the charges” and is “entitled to the presumption of innocence”.</p><p><strong>Mark Seal</strong>, a special correspondent for Vanity Fair and author of a profile of Ghislaine, tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>about Ghislaine’s relationship with Epstein while the Guardian reporter<strong> Victoria Bekiempis</strong> discusses the charges she is facing. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jul/16/who-is-ghislaine-maxwell-and-does-she-hold-the-key-to-justice-for-epsteins-victims">Continue reading...</a>
