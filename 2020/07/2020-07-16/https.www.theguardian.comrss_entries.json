He didn\u2019t say when, though he gave the distinct impression that the ideal time would be a long way into the future. By when he would have had time to line up any number of patsies to take the rap for his own failures. One of whom is sure to be the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance.</p><p>It\u2019s fair to say that Vallance has been a little slow off the mark right from the very start of the pandemic. Not so much with the science \u2013 though he\u2019s hardly excelled at that \u2013 but with PR management. For a long time, he was under the impressions that his prime role was to provide the government with independent scientific advice; it\u2019s only over the course of the last few weeks he\u2019s realised his real function was to be a human shield for Boris.

"description": "<p>Ireland may not have given Apple illegal state aid, but the system still needs to change</p><p>What happens when a European member state such as Ireland or the Netherlands decides it wants to act like a corporate tax haven? Because taxation is a national sovereignty issue, the European commission can\u2019t directly challenge the corporate tax laws of EU member states. So the commission has instead been trying to use state aid laws to prevent tax avoidance in smaller countries. This bundle of rules is designed to promote market competition and prevent countries giving unfair advantages to companies. In the eyes of the commission, allowing a company to avoid taxes is much like giving it a cash subsidy.</p><p>In 2016, the European commission found that Apple had <a href=\"http://economic-incentives.blogspot.com/2016/03/apple-sales-internationalby-numbers.html\">transferred around \u20ac110bn of sales</a> from their European operations to a head office of two subsidiaries in Ireland. These subsidiaries were registered in Ireland, but were non-resident for tax purposes \u2013 so Apple\u2019s profits in Irish accounts weren\u2019t taxed. In a controversial ruling, the commission decided that Ireland had given special treatment to these Apple subsidiaries. In other words, Ireland had actively facilitated the Apple group\u2019s corporate tax avoidance strategies. According to the commission, these tax incentives amounted to illegal state aid, and Apple were ordered to pay the Irish government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/19/apple-ireland-eu-tax-ruling-european-commission-us-irs\">almost \u20ac14</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/dec/19/apple-ireland-eu-tax-ruling-european-commission-us-irs\">bn in unpaid taxes</a>.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/eu-tax-avoidance-big-companies-ireland-apple-state-aid\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/16/eu-tax-avoidance-big-companies-ireland-apple-state-aid", "date_published": "2020-07-16 16:47:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The background to EU citizens' court win over US tech giants", "description": "<p>Data privacy rights have been backed by a new ruling, the latest twist in a nine-year campaign to limit surveillance by US agencies <br /></p><p>A ruling of the court of justice of the European Union (CJEU) could prevent tech companies like Facebook from sending data from the trading bloc to the US, after finding that there are not enough protections against snooping by American intelligence agencies.
