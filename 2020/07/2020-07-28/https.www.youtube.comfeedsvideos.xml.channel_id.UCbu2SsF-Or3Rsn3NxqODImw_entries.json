In this video, we show off the entire mermaid set that you can get from Pascal when you give him scallops that you find when deep seas diving. All of Pascal's mermaid furniture will come in the form of a DIY recipe that can be crafted with shells that you find on your beach and pearls that you find at the bottom of the sea. Beside the furniture, Pascal will also give you two types of mermaid dresses, shoes, and a tiara. You will even have a chance of getting a pearl from Pascal, too. Pascal will show up on your island at least once a day when you catch a scallop from the ocean. He doesn't always arrive on the first scallop of the day, so don't stop diving until you see him! Below is the full list of mermaid items and if you comment your favorite, you could win all of the furniture in the mermaid set!\n\nAll Mermaid DIY Recipes\nMermaid bed\nMermaid rug\nMermaid lamp\nMermaid sofa\nMermaid wall\nMermaid chair\nMermaid shelf\nMermaid table\nMermaid closet\nMermaid screen\nMermaid vanity\nMermaid dresser\nMermaid flooring\nMermaid wall clock\nAll Mermaid Clothing\nMermaid tiara\nMermaid fishy dress (two colors)\nMermaid princess dress (two colors)\nMermaid shoes (two colors)\n\n You can also see our full mermaid guide at https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-mermaid-diys-and-clothing-items-in-animal-cros/1100-6479329/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GulyiWwsWvA", "date_published": "2020-07-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Halo Infinite - Everything You Need To Know", "description": "The latest game in the long running Halo franchise has made its gameplay debut at Xbox\u2019s July Games Showcase.
