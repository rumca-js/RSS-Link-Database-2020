A sequel to Naughty Dog\u2019s original Crash trilogy, It\u2019s About Time is a brand-new mainline instalment developed by Toys for Bob and slated for release in October on PS4 and Xbox One.\n\nAhead of release, Alessandro and Eddie got some hands-on time with the game, and in a new video, they share their overall impressions. The video covers two different levels, Dino Dash and Snow Way Out, and they could not be more different. One has you escaping a gigantic t-rex and the other is set in a frosty world with zombie fishermen.\n\nThe video showcases gameplay not only featuring Crash as the playable character, but also the villainous Dr. Neo Cortex. He\u2019s cartoonishly evil, even going as far to joke about making Bandicoot soup. Also in the video, Alessandro and Eddie speak about the game\u2019s new masks, which give you the ability to slow down time and phase the world, while they also discuss how It\u2019s About Time is delivering story in a new and interesting way.\n\nIt\u2019s About Time launches on October 2 for PS4 and Xbox One.

The ships also sport a robust collection of loadouts and customization options. Rob was impressed with how the game alleviates some of the problems with the \"death loop\" (where you and your opponent are constantly chasing each other in never-ending circles) and how it utilizes a Power Management system that allows you to focus power into things like lasers, engines, and shields while taking power away from other abilities.\n\nStar Wars: Squadrons is set to be released on October 2, 2020 for PS4, Xbox One, and PC.
