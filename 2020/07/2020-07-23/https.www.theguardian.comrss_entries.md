Don’t spend the few remaining months of summer desperately trying to secure the last vacant cottage in Cornwall, the only remaining patch of campsites in the Lake District, or the Western Isles’ one free hotel room. With more people set to be holidaying at home in the UK than ever before this summer, the wise choice will be to avoid the usual favourite zones and set your sights instead on a crowd-free break, such as one in these underappreciated areas.</p><p><strong>Black Mountains, Wales<br /></strong>Lying in the shadow of the Brecon Beacons, the hilly uplands of the Black Mountains are a wonderful crinkle of rugged beauty, but without the Gore-Tex crush of their crowded, loftier neighbours. Stretching across 80 square miles of Powys, Monmouthshire and Herefordshire, the area is near hubs such as Hay-on-Wye and Abergavenny, but with many more enchanting secrets wrapped in their folds: including chapels, captivating villages and fine pubs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/jul/23/from-the-black-mountains-to-the-north-pennines-four-crowd-free-uk-summer-destinations">Continue reading...</a>

## Superhot: Mind Control Delete review – a stylish John Wick-style shooter

<p><strong>PC, Mac, PS4, Xbox One; Superhot Team<br /></strong>This time-bending game offers little in the way of plot but compensates with thrillingly meditative action</p><p>Taking place in a computer simulation where the world is carved from alabaster and your opponents made of orange glass, Superhot hinges on the gimmick that time only moves when you do. Remain still in one of its wickedly stylish combat arenas, and the world will hang in an almost-frozen state. Enemies stand like statues while bullets linger in the air, moving as if through treacle. Look around or press a button and the game will begin to speed up, projectiles and adversaries flying towards you in a flash.</p><p>It’s the world as viewed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/18/john-wick-chapter-3-parabellum-review-keanu-reeves">John Wick</a>. Everything is abstracted apart from the targets you need to eliminate and the projectiles coming to kill you. You’re able to spot and sidestep bullets with ease, and to plan your attacks with the precision and thought normally reserved for strategy games. Superhot’s combat plays up to this notion of planned improvisation. Objects such as bottles and bricks can be picked up and tossed at opponents; when an antagonist staggers and drop their weapons, you can catch them before they hit the ground and turn them on their previous owner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jul/23/superhot-mind-control-delete-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An atrocity unpunished ... forget the triumphant tales of abolition – the brutal death of a teenage slave girl reveals important truths of Britain’s imperial history</p><p>You are trapped in a net cast by a white man reeking of rum and smoke, and then dragged miles to the coast. You are processed, bound into chains, and led to vast wooden ships. You are packed into the hold and spend months on the ocean. You have little to eat, little to drink, little air to breathe. All around you there is coughing and fever. On deck, they make you dance to keep your muscles taut, to preserve your price at the market. If you resist, they will beat you; if you die, they will throw you overboard.</p><p>In time, you see land. You are paraded on the dockside, prodded and inspected. They feel your arms; they look at your teeth. One man says “Yes”. You are loaded on to a cart and driven over rough land along dirt tracks until you arrive at a house and fields. You suffer searing pain as a burning iron pushes into your skin. You are taken to a shed and thrown to the floor. You collapse and sleep, but the sun rises and then you work. You have not done this work before, but if you do it badly, they will whip you. If you complain, they will whip you again. If you refuse to work, or you fight back, they will kill you in front of the others. So, you work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/23/on-the-middle-passage-by-nicholas-rogers-review-slavery-and-the-british-empire">Continue reading...</a>

Now, viewers don’t have to be sitting in a velvet seat, just on their own sofa. Plus, if you create a rich digital archive that covers the range of works being made, it puts an end to the hand-wringing about how to make theatre more accessible. Even if some online productions are charging, it is still significantly cheaper than buying a ticket to the West End.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/23/on-screen-theatre-let-me-see-plays-i-could-never-afford-im-thrilled-its-back">Continue reading...</a>

He and I are about the same age. In terms of our life journeys, that is where the similarities largely end.

## Helen Mirren at 75: wild costumes, blazing performances – and a spell as a rock banshee

<p>She has played cops, rockers, monarchs and murderers. As Helen Mirren turns 75, we celebrate her astonishing career – and remember her letter to the Guardian that led to questions in parliament </p><p>Who is Helen Mirren? Looking back over her career, as she hits 75, it is tempting to see her as two separate people. First, there was the outspoken young classical actor who fiercely resisted objectification, whether from newspapers (“Stratford’s very own sex queen” was a notorious Sunday Times headline) or TV chatshow hosts. Then came the mature Mirren with a gift for playing monarchs (Elizabeth I on TV, Elizabeth II on screen and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/05/the-audience-review-helen-mirren">stage</a>), for picking up every award going, and for being a great dame associated with excellent causes. Among many, she is an ambassador for <a href="https://www.womenforwomen.org.uk/dame-helen-mirren">Women International</a>.</p><p>Yet I see no great gulf between the two Mirrens. Having followed her career for 50 years, several things strike me. One is that she has always been a dedicated, highly skilled actor. Another is that she is a perennial mix of the nomadic and the majestic: you don’t get to play Cleopatra, as she did for the National Youth Theatre when she was 20, without some inbuilt imperiousness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/23/helen-mirren-at-75-michael-billington">Continue reading...</a>
