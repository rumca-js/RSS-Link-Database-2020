First, there was the outspoken young classical actor who fiercely resisted objectification, whether from newspapers (\u201cStratford\u2019s very own sex queen\u201d was a notorious Sunday Times headline) or TV chatshow hosts. Then came the mature Mirren with a gift for playing monarchs (Elizabeth I on TV, Elizabeth II on screen and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/05/the-audience-review-helen-mirren\">stage</a>), for picking up every award going, and for being a great dame associated with excellent causes.
