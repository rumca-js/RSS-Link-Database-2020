Interferon seems to be news of the day. I plan to cover Sweden in more detail soon, there was just no time here to make a case. Thats the problem with short interviews.

Dr Tedros had struck a deal with China that helped him secure election

WHO was a “political” rather than “science-based organisation” that had failed to deal with the pandemic

Dr Tedros, who was ... bought by the Chinese government,

I can’t say more, but I can tell, I’m saying this on a firm intelligence foundation, a deal was made... 

there was a deal making election and when push came to shove, you get dead Britons, because of the deal that was made.”

Comments are unacceptable, untrue and without any foundation

The entire focus of the organisation is on saving lives

International traffic: no restrictions recommended

Wuhan city is a major domestic and international transport hub. 

Currently, there are no reports of cases outside of Wuhan City. 

Given the heavy population movements, expected to significantly increase during the Chinese New Year in the last week of January, the risk of cases being reported form elsewhere is increased.

WHO does not recommend any specific health measures for travellers.

The current outbreak originated in Wuhan city, which is a major domestic and international transport hub. 

Given the large population movements, expected to significantly increase during the Chinese New Year in the last week of January, 

and the observed human to human transmission, 

it is not unexpected that new confirmed cases will continue to appear in other areas and countries.

With the information currently available for the novel coronavirus, 

WHO advises that measures to limit the risk of exportation or importation of the disease should be implemented, 

without unnecessary restrictions of international traffic.

WHO … there was no need for measures that “unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade”

Monday was the 3rd February

WHO 4th February

It's important to underline that 99% of the cases are in China and 97% of the deaths are in Hubei Province. 

This is still first and foremost an emergency for China. 

We continue to work closely with the Chinese government to support its efforts to address this outbreak at the epicentre. 

That's our best chance of preventing a broader global crisis.

No matter where you live or how old you are you can be a leader in your community not just to defeat the pandemic but to build back better. 

In recent years we have seen young people leading grass-roots movements for climate change and racial equality.
 
Now we need young people to start a global movement for health, for a world in which health is a human right, not a privilege.

Cell, Making Sense of Mutation: What D614G Means for the COVID-19 Pandemic Remains Unclear 

https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)30817-5.pdf

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200702144054.htm

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has a low mutation rate overall

Much lower than the viruses that cause influenza and HIV-AIDS

Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in China in late 2019

Virus mutations

A virus mutation can become common through fitness or by chance

Emerged early during the pandemic

Aspartate to glycine, D614G mutation

https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.20.161323v1

Dominant mutational variant at the 614 position of S protein
 
Old version D614 (Aspartate)

New version G614 (Glycine)

G614 is most prevalent in many places around the world

Korber et al. (2020) hypothesized that the rapid spread of G614 was because it is more infectious than D614

Will D614G Make Outbreaks Harder to Control?

The great majority of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in the United States arrived from Europe

Over the period that G614 became the global majority variant, the number of introductions from China where D614 was still dominant were declining

As numbers in Europe were going up

If G614 truly is more transmissible in equivalently mixing populations

Not enough in vivo data just now

Will D614G Make Infections More Severe?

Patients infected with G614 had higher levels of virus RNA 

But no differences identified in hospital outcomes

Will D614G Impact Therapeutic and Vaccine Designs?

Unlikely

D614G is not in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein

Antibodies generated from natural infection with viruses containing D614 or G614 can cross-neutralize

Suggesting that the locus is not critical for antibody - mediated immunity

Conclusions 

The G614 variant now is the pandemic
