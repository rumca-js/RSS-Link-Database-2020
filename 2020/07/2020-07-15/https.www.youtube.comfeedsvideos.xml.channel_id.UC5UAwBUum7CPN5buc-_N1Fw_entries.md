Pusirms has released their Librem 14 laptop, and damn it looks good. While I’ve been critical of their Librem 5 efforts, their laptop actually have a pretty good reputation, and could have been candidates for my next work laptop, but this thing has a 6 core intel CPU, with up to 32Gb of RAM, and great, simple design.

Duck Duck GO reappareared in India, after being gone since the first of July. The reason for its unavailability wasn’t clear, with users speculating that the indian government blocked it, or that DNS lookups were failing. https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/4/21313393/duckduckgo-india-privacy-apps-banned

Nvidia open sourced their NVAPI SDK. It’s the core Nvidia SDK that allows people to access the hardware on Windows machines. This gives the DXVK team something to sink their teeth in, as it will allow them to better understand and use Nvidia GPUs in Wine and proton, instead of spoofing an AMD GPU.

Microsoft won’t support PHP for Windows anymore. Starting with PHP for Windows version 8, Microsoft won’t provide any support for it, although some other team can take up the packaging and support duties. https://news-web.php.net/php.internals/110907

The Linux kernel will no longer use the terms blacklist, whitelist, master or slave. This comes at a time where peope are more aware of sensitive terms. I’m not going to go into that debate here, let’s just say that if a terminology offends people, I don’t see why we woudln’t change it, especially since it has basically no impact on how the linux kernel works. It seems a lot of other projects are also going to migrate from these previous terminologies, so it shouldn’t be too complicated to adopt.

July 15th
ThePine64 released a new, more powerful PinePhone, equipped with 3Gb of RAM, and accompanied by a USB dock that lets users use the phone as a full desktop. This new version should run a little bit better than the previous one I got, which was, pretty slow in its early days. It will sell for 199$, which is a very reasonable price, and I’d recommend you gor this one instead of the base model if you want to dabble with a Linux phone !
