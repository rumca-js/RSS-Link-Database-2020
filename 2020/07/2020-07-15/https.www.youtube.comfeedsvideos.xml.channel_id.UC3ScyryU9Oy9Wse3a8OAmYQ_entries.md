The voices of Iraqis take center stage in “Once Upon a Time in Iraq,” an unprecedented, two-hour FRONTLINE documentary special. They share their personal accounts and lasting memories of life under Saddam Hussein, the U.S.-led invasion of their country and the years of chaos that followed — from sectarian violence to the rise and brutal reign of ISIS.
