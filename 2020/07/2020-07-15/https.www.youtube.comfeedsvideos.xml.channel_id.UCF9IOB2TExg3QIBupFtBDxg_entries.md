Rashes had been reported, China and Europe in hospitalised patients

Study to systematically gather data about skin rashes in milder cases in the wider population

Viral skin rashes, (Dr Veronique Bataille)

“Many viral infections can affect the skin, so it’s not surprising that we are seeing these rashes in COVID-19,” 

“However, it is important that people know that in some cases, a rash may be the first or only symptom of the disease

So if you notice a new rash, you should take it seriously by self-isolating and getting tested as soon as possible.”

Study initial findings

336,000 regular UK app users

8.8% of people reporting a positive coronavirus swab test had experienced a skin rash as part of their symptoms

Also, rash reported in a further 8.2% of users with cough, fever or anosmia 

5.4% of people with a negative test result

To investigate further

Images and information from 12,000 people

17% of respondents testing positive for coronavirus reported a rash as the first symptom of the disease

21% of those confirmed as being infected with coronavirus, the rash was their only symptom

Rashes, three categories 

Hive-type rash (urticaria)

Raised bumps on the skin which come and go quite quickly (hours) and are usually very itchy

Can involve any part of the body

Often starts with intense itching of the palms or soles

Can cause swelling of the lips and eyelids

These rashes can present quite early on in the infection, but can also last a long time afterwards

Prickly heat or chickenpox-type rash

Erythemato-papular or erythemato-vesicular rash

Areas of small, itchy red bumps that can occur anywhere on the body

Particularly the elbows and knees, back of the hands and feet

The rash can persist for days or weeks.

COVID fingers and toes (chillblains)

Reddish and purplish bumps on the fingers or toes

May be sore but not usually itchy

This type of rash is most specific to COVID-19

More common in younger people

Tends to present later on

Dr Justine Kluk 

“These findings highlight the importance of keeping an eye on any new changes in your skin, such as lumps, bumps or rashes. 

Early reporting of COVID-associated rashes by members of the public and recognition of their significance by frontline healthcare practitioners

May increase the detection of coronavirus infections and help to stop the spread.” 

Dr Tanya Bleiker, President, British Association of Dermatologists

“Documenting the skin symptoms associated with COVID-19 is an important piece of the puzzle in building our understanding of the disease.

Skin symptoms may play a crucial role in detecting infection in people who are otherwise asymptomatic."

We’re delighted to be working with the team at KCL to make an image library of COVID-19 skin manifestations accessible on a dedicated website. 

This will help healthcare professionals guide their decision making in clinical settings

and may have a role in educating the public about skin symptoms which would warrant self-isolation.”

Port Elizabeth, Eastern Cape

Staff on strike or sick

Perinatal deaths

Senior doctors

‘an epic failure of a deeply corrupt system’

‘institutional burn-out… a sense of chronic exploitation’

‘the department of health essentially bankrupt, and a system on its knees with no strategic management’

‘There's a huge amount of fear, and of mental and emotional fatigue’ 

‘We were working with a skeleton staff even before Covid-19 and now we're down another 30%’

Services are starting to crumble under the strain

COVID has opened up all the chronic cracks in the system

Patients had been ‘fighting for oxygen’ at Livingstone Hospital in Port Elizabeth

‘like a war situation’

Blood and waste on the floors

Lack of Personal Protective Equipment

Oxygen shortages

Severe shortage of ambulances

No ventilation

Patients sleeping ‘under newspaper’

Rats

Senior nurse

‘Every day I come to work in fear’

‘The infection numbers are going up’

‘Every day we've got chaos’

Maternity

Lot of pregnant women all over the wards

Mothers and infants died.

‘I was personally involved in the delivery of two dead infants and know there were more. This is very unusual. To have several mummies and babies dying in one week in one hospital is totally unheard of and unacceptable’

Probably caused by lack of health care

Pregnant women, waiting for days, sometimes lying in corridors, for urgent surgery

Confirmed reports of an unusual number of stillborn infants in recent weeks

Provincial health department was generally seen as so inept and dysfunctional that private donors, businesses and charitable funds anxious to help in the fight against Covid-19 were refusing to deal directly with it

President Cyril Ramaphosa

"the storm is upon us".
