For modern readers curious about the country, the 150 years following unification in 1871 are of most interest. Since becoming a modern nation state, Germany has seen intense industrialisation, two world wars, nazism and communism, the ignominy of division and the joy of reunification. Given this history, there are different Germanys to read about, and I have compiled this list with that in mind. As elsewhere, until the postwar era most high-profile books are by white males, but the proportion of female and BAME voices has increased since reunification, and is reflected in my more recent choices.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/15/10-best-novels-set-in-germany-that-will-take-you-there\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/15/10-best-novels-set-in-germany-that-will-take-you-there", "date_published": "2020-07-15 05:30:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The meaning of 'pampering' in a post-lockdown world", "description": "<p>As we ease back into normal life salon treatments are comforting \u2013 but there\u2019s a chance they will never feel the same again</p><p>I was so keen for my post-lockdown trim last Saturday that I arrived at George Northwood\u2019s salon just off London\u2019s Oxford Street 20 minutes early.
