This year Activision is also expected to publish a Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War title which is being developed by Treyarch. It\u2019s unclear at this stage if Cold War\u2019s multiplayer will tie into Warzone directly, but it would make sense for Cold War items to turn up in Warzone. \n\nAhead of season 5, this video takes a look at eleven changes that could be made to the game right now during season 4. Some of these changes include a better drop system, expanded communication ping wheel,  improved armor mechanics, better climbing system, balancing, and major map changes and events. Warzone has teased in-game events most notably when players discovered phones ringing around the map that allowed them to solve a puzzle and enter Bunker 11. Inside they found a blood-covered room where nuclear weapons appeared to have been stolen. The missing warhead later turned up in another bunker on top of a ballistic missile. Fan-favorite Captain Price arrived in season 4 with his re-formed task force 141 to handle the problem. As of yet, nothing else has happened. \n\nWarzone is one of the many cross-progression multiplayer modes in Call Of Duty: Modern warfare. Warzone has also experimented with many limited timed variations including increasing the player count to 200 and a mode where players fight over juggernaut suits. Modern Warfare is currently out for PS4, Xbox One, and PC. Warzone is also available standalone and free-to-play.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerUciniCCQ", "date_published": "2020-07-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
