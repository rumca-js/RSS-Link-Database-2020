More systemic racial disparities in the American penal system are too often hidden from plain sight. The US incarcerates more of its citizens – <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html">2.2 million people</a> – than any other country on Earth. African American adults are nearly six times more likely to receive a prison sentence than white adults.

<p>Being angry about those who fail to turn up for bookings is one of my few remaining pleasures</p><p>We’re all, in our various ways, working on the best system for the distribution of condemnation. Condemnation is all the rage thanks to all the rage and to the fact that, with the invention of social media, a method has been found for both automating and monetising it. There’s a consensus that a lot of people are bad, though it falls short of complete agreement on exactly who, so there’s a lot of condemning that obviously needs to get done.</p><p>Cancel culture is vital to filling our virally emptied days, when there’s nothing else to do because we’ve been forced, among other things, to cancel culture. There’ll be no ballet or theatre, or indeed nightclubs or parties, for the foreseeable, so it’s the perfect time to get ahead with sticking it to anyone who you reckon phobes something you phile or philes things in a way that’s wrong.

<p>Athens offers generous tax incentives to lure Europe’s retirees – and boost its own struggling economy </p><p>Most countries want to attract the young and the willing – entrepreneurs with ideas, students looking to learn, people prepared to do the jobs locals turn down.

<p>The acclaimed author of Cloud Atlas hits a bum note with this hackneyed story of a band in the late 1960s</p><p>I may never forgive <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/21/david-mitchell-on-writing-cloud-atlas">David Mitchell</a> for writing <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/fiction.asbyatt">Cloud Atlas</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/mar/06/fiction.asbyatt">.</a> It was a gloriously inventive mind-storm of a novel, leaping wildly through time and space, seemingly unconstrained by the narrative gravity that pins other books to the ground. I was in my early 20s when it came out and remember pressing it on everyone I knew. I devoured his other novels and waited eagerly for new work. I’ve carried on reading him dutifully since, but nothing has come close to the heights of <em>Cloud Atlas</em>, and each new novel is met with a mixture of hope and the sense that he’d pulled a fast one on me with the glory of his one-hit wonder.</p><p>So we come to his latest, the hefty <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/david-mitchell-announces-utopia-avenue-his-first-novel-in-five-years">Utopia Avenue</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/sep/26/david-mitchell-announces-utopia-avenue-his-first-novel-in-five-years">,</a> which is the story of the rise and fall of a rock band in the late 1960s. The novel is arranged into three separate “albums” – Paradise Is the Road to Paradise, The Stuff of Life and The Third Planet, with each “track” written from the perspective of a different member of the band (or, on one occasion, the band’s manager, Levon Franklin). Dean Moss, on bass, is a heart-throb from Gravesend who speaks in a grating cockney pastiche; Peter “Griff” Griffin, the drummer is “a northern diamond in the rough. Anarchic, sweary, likes a drink”; “Elf” (Elizabeth) Holloway, the singer, has recently separated from her musical and romantic partner, a laddish Australian, and is primly middle class; finally, there’s Jasper de Zoet (yes, a relative of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/09/thousand-autumns-jacob-zoet-mitchell">Jacob</a> de Zoet, the title character of Mitchell’s 2010 novel, <em>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</em> – and living off a Dutch East Indian legacy). Jasper is on guitar, a quiet, troubled, intense young man.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/19/utopia-avenue-by-david-mitchell-review-endless-prog-rock-noodling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Received wisdom is all very well, but sometimes the science proves otherwise</p><p>Gardening is full of received wisdom that is treated as gospel and handed down across the generations – from putting a layer of crocks at the bottom of pots for drainage, to the back-breaking work of Victorian “double-digging” to improve soil structure. But when tested scientifically much of this old-school advice turns out not to be supported by evidence. In fact, in the above two examples, they are actually likely to give you worse results than if you simply hadn’t bothered at all.</p><p>Even scientists aren’t immune to repeating received wisdom, or potentially extrapolating more from the data than it actually shows, particularly if the claim supports our existing views. However, the wonderful thing about science, unlike gardening dogma, is that it is forever changing as new evidence comes to light. In fact, as a botanist, I think the freedom to change one’s mind, to hold your hands up to getting it wrong, is science’s greatest strength – particularly in 2020. So I am starting, in my own small way, right here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/19/do-houseplants-really-improve-air-quality-new-research-makes-james-wong-doubt-it">Continue reading...</a>

## Clemency review – Alfre Woodard quietly dazzles in this superb death row drama

<p>Woodard plays a conflicted prison warden slowly unravelling in writer-director Chinonye Chukwu’s remarkable film</p><p>Amid the many oversights of January’s Oscar nominations, Alfre Woodard’s absence from the best actress shortlist was particularly telling. Having earned a supporting actress nomination for <em>Cross Creek</em> in the 80s, Woodard hit a career high in this deceptively low-key death row drama from writer-director Chinonye Chukwu, who last year became the first black woman to win the US dramatic grand jury prize at Sundance. As the warden in a maximum security prison facing a crisis of faith in her work and her life, Woodard is brilliantly measured and understated, a quality that (as Michael B Jordan’s similarly snubbed performance in <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/19/just-mercy-review-death-row-drama-jamie-foxx-michael-b-jordan-bryan-stevenson">Just Mercy</a></em> proved) rarely attracts Oscar attention.</p><p>Woodard plays Bernadine Williams, who prides herself on treating her inmates with dignity as they move through incarceration to whatever awaits – whether that be freedom or death. From the prison gates, the chants of protesters provide a constant background noise, which she zones out even as it seeps into her office. Yet Bernadine is having doubts about the death penalty – doubts that turn into cold-sweat fears when a botched procedure reveals the true horror of execution.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/19/clemency-review-chinonye-chukwu-alfre-woodard-superb-death-row-drama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are many good reasons why foreign travel might have to remain in fantasy land this year</p><p>There has been an outbreak of intense sexting among my girlfriends: whispers of desire; shared fantasies and sensual memories. “We’d just lie somewhere shady with delicious snacks and NOT TALK,” writes one. “Remember reading quietly in the air-conditioned library in Bologna? I want that,” says another. My friend H goes all in. “There’s a soft lagoon breeze in our tiny pensione courtyard,” she types, cruelly. “White peaches from the Rialto for breakfast.” “We find the perfect bar with good pastries,” I counter. “After two days they make our cappuccinos without us ordering, so we feel like Commissario Brunetti” (Donna Leon’s most Ocado of fictional detectives).</p><p>In reality, we’re going nowhere. We can’t trust the government’s rickety air bridges and even if we could afford it, we probably shouldn’t be flying, for ecological as well as virus reasons. It’s desperately unfair that mine and my parents’ generations went wherever we liked, and now preach about carbon to young people who have barely had a chance to go anywhere, but the planet is self-evidently on fire.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/19/family-holidays-are-not-always-the-break-you-were-hoping-for-emma-beddington">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Supermodel, Cambridge graduate, activist – Lily Cole has many strings to her bow. Now she’s written a book that tackles our most urgent challenge</p><p>I am tramping through the long grass of a Sussex nature reserve with supermodel-turned-activist Lily Cole. Beyond the gorse and the bracken, a vast open sky stretches before us. It certainly beats a sterile Zoom call. “How amazing is this?” she says. “I’ve been talking about moving to nature for years and then, finally, I decided to do it two years ago. I’ve been very grateful for it in general and particularly, obviously, these last few months.”</p><p>Cole, 32, has just rocked up on a big beast of an e-bike. Of course she is on a bike, though she could have as easily been driving her fancy electric Tesla car. The Tesla tech whiz Elon Musk is just one of the so-called “Wizards” she has interviewed for her book, <em>Who Cares Wins: Reasons for Optimism in Our Changing World</em>. The Wizards are the people who are using technology in an attempt to innovate us out of the environmental crisis. In the other camp are the “Prophets” who say we must cut back, travel less, consume less, simplify. Cole examines both approaches in the book.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jul/19/lily-cole-fashion-activist-environment-climate-change-interview-we-need-to-be-more-forgiving">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Blaming individuals for structural discrimination will only make it worse</p><p>“It’s a paralysing emotion… you can’t get anything done.” I’ve reflected on Toni Morrison’s take on anger a lot in recent weeks. There has been so much to be angry about: the brutal murder of George Floyd; the denials of a serious problem with the way the police treat black people here in the UK; the higher rates at which people of colour are dying of Covid-19. Like many others, I’ve keenly felt the exhaustion of having to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/nhs-heroes-and-targets-of-racists">explain why it’s upsetting</a> to people who just don’t get it.</p><p>Righteous anger has its place - it can be cathartic and healing - but it’s not enough to change the world. There is nothing fair about this: it is a double injustice that it is not enough for those who experience racism to share their anger about it; we not only have to explain, but to persuade and cajole.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/19/ive-been-tempted-by-righteous-anger-against-racists-its-not-much-help-in-changing-society">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rising star Tyler Mitchell imagines a black utopia for young Americans</p><p>Few photographers in recent years have emerged with quite the acclaim of <a href="https://www.tylermitchell.co/">Tyler Mitchell</a>. Now 25, Mitchell made history two years ago when he became the first black photographer in the 125-year history of American <em>Vogue</em> to shoot a cover image – <a href="https://www.tylermitchell.co/photography/beyonce/">his pictures of Beyoncé</a>, with a halo of flowers, in natural light, were full of the joy and stylish exuberance he had made his own.</p><p>A book and exhibition of his work is called, pointedly, <em><a href="https://prestelpublishing.randomhouse.de/book/I-Can-Make-You-Feel-Good/Tyler-Mitchell/Prestel/e563080.rhd">I Can Make You Feel Good</a></em>. This staged picture of hula hoopers in Brooklyn is typical, he says, of “the conversations that I and other black artists around me want to have. All the pictures propose what our world should look like – if we are allowed all the freedoms we have been historically denied.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jul/19/the-big-picture-happiness-is-a-hula-hoop-with-tyler-mitchell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Review by Sustrans rules that only traffic-free routes will be part of its network, which excludes the UK’s most popular long-distance cycle path</p><p>The National Cycle Network (NCN) will lose almost a quarter of its 16,000 miles of UK-wide cycling and walking routes from Monday, as part of an ongoing plan to improve safety standards. Some of the UK’s favourite long-distance cycle routes, including the Coast to Coast (C2C) from Whitehaven to Tynemouth, will now no longer be part of the official network because it has a fast 4.5-mile on-road stretch over the Hartside Pass in Cumbria.</p><p>The move follows<a href="https://www.sustrans.org.uk/about-us/paths-for-everyone/"> a 2018 review by Sustrans</a>, the charity that created the NCN, which found that 42% of the network’s routes were “poor”, with substandard crossings, signage or main road sections, and 4% “very poor”, taking cyclists on roads with heavy traffic. In addition, urban roads with speed limits in excess of 20mph and rural roads faster than 40mph are being taken out of the network.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jul/19/national-cycle-network-sustrans-cuts-quarter-uk-routes-safety-grounds">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The band’s drummer describes his glory years with the post-punk art-rockers, his bass-playing wife, Tina, and the enigma that is David Byrne </p><p>Talking Heads were the most innovative and among the most successful of the post-punk bands. I considered them a sort of postmodern Rolling Stones, in that they combined danceable rhythms and soul music stylings (echoes of Al Green) with art-rock elements such as synthetic sounds and the paranoid persona (Anthony Perkins with electric guitar) of singer David Byrne.</p><p>Chris Frantz was the drummer, and the most normal-looking band member, being clean cut, bouffant-haired, with a liking for Brooks Brothers shirts. His wife, Tina Weymouth, was the bassist, and she rivalled the jittery Byrne for one’s attention. She was (and is) chic, elfin, the bass too big for her, but she swung it about like a dancing partner. Frantz’s memoir is the story of the band, of the Frantz-Weymouth marriage, which is apparently blissful (“How I adore her!”), and their relations with Byrne, which were less so.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/19/remain-in-love-by-chris-frantz-review-once-in-a-lifetime-with-talking-heads">Continue reading...</a>
