SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity in cases of COVID-19 and SARS, and uninfected controls 

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z_reference.pdf

Memory T cells induced by infection

Future susceptibility and clinical severity

Patients recovered from in COVID-19

T cells from recovered patients recognised multiple regions of the SARS-CoV-2

Patients recovered from SARS (SRS-CoV-1)

SARS-recovered patients (n=23) still possess long-lasting memory T cells reactive to SARS

17 years after the 2003 outbreak

Robust cross-reactivity to SARS-CoV-2 NP, (structural nucleocapsid protein) 

Surprisingly

Frequently detected SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells in individuals with no history of SARS, 

COVID-19 or contact with SARS/COVID-19 patients (n=37)

In these people the T cells were active against a different part of the virus

Epitope low homology to “common cold” human coronaviruses

Infection with betacoronaviruses induces multispecific and long-lasting T cell immunity to the structural protein NP

Cows, dogs, bats, rodents

Understanding pre-existing T cell immunity in the general population is of paramount importance for the management of the current COVID-19 pandemic

US data

https://theconversation.com/us-coronavirus-data-will-now-go-straight-to-the-white-house-heres-what-this-means-for-the-world-142814

CDC being bypassed in the collection of COVID-19 data

Department of Health and Human Services

Hospitals ordered to send all COVID-19 patient information to a central database in 
Washington DC

https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/covid-19-faqs-hospitals-hospital-laboratory-acute-care-facility-data-reporting.pdf

https://www.newsweek.com/health-experts-fear-covid-data-will-hidden-public-after-trump-orders-hospitals-bypass-cdc-1517968

Federal order

Hospitals are now required to submit COVID-19 data directly to the Department of Health and Human Services

Instead of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Streamlined and faster

Data not publicly accessible

Option to report data to state officials, with a written release


Daily updates on English Covid-19 deaths paused

https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jul/18/daily-updates-on-english-covid-19-deaths-paused-amid-accuracy-concerns

https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk

Currently the daily deaths measure counts all people who have tested positive and since died

No cut-off between time of testing and date of death

PHE regularly looks for people on the NHS database who have ever tested positive, and simply checks to see if they are still alive or not

In Scotland and NI, there is a 28-day cut-off

After which a patient who has tested positive is not automatically considered to have died 
from the virus

International comparisons are misleading because countries record coronavirus deaths differently


UK, Millions of antibody tests

https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jul/18/uk-plans-millions-of-coronavirus-antibody-tests-after-trial-success-report

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/07/17/exclusive-game-changing-coronavirus-antibody-test-passes-first/

Oxford University in partnership with leading UK diagnostics firms, Rapid Test Consortium (UK-RTC) 

98.6 % accurate

20 minutes

98.8% sensitivity (misses 1.2% of actual positive cases giving a false negative)

98.4% specificity (gives a false positive in 1.6% of cases of people who are actually negative)

Millions by end of the year

Healthcare professionals first

Then millions of people to use at home

Send in their results to a central database.

Each kit will come in a box with a QR barcode and instructions

Uses the "full-length spike protein" 

To capture so-called IgG antibodies

IgM first 23 days

IgG up to 49 days

Flu vaccine

Four essential pillars of the response

Strong and humble leadership

Community engagement

Suppressing transmission

Saving lives.


US

Deaths, 78,772

Many governors and mayors have loosened restrictions in recent weeks

We still have not reached the peak in Brazil

Because of successive epidemics occurring in various regions

South Brazil

Spread to the interior

An older population

Cold and humidity

India

Cases, +34,884 = 1,038,716

Numbers expected to double by 10th August

Infections spreading to more rural areas

Deaths, + 671 = 26,273

Local governments reimpose focused lockdowns

Victoria

Directions will be updated to send a clear message
We are facing a pandemic and this is not the time for parties

This includes traveling to regional Victoria to attend
 
https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/face-masks-covid-19

Transmission driver

Decrease in the number of cases being spread between families

Majority of outbreaks, people are working closely together.

Inspections and enforcement blitz will be carried out in workplaces across the state.

Aged care and health care settings, transmission remains high

22 July, visitation will be restricted to those defined as carers

Masks in Melbourne

https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/updates/coronavirus-covid-19/face-coverings-mandatory-melbourne-and-mitchell-shire

11:59pm on Wednesday 22 July

Chance to buy or make a covering

But if you already have one, please start wearing it now

If you don't have a mask, a scarf is better than nothing. 

As with everything, this shouldn't be about looking for loopholes. 

It's about each of us doing something small to keep everyone around us safe.

“those who have encountered the virus and achieved complete immunity”

Still no herd immunity
