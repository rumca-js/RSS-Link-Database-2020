or over of Bangladeshi or Pakistani ethnicity are more likely to live with those from a range of ages compared with people of white ethnicity of the same age group\n\nThis compares with around a quarter of households that have at least one person aged 70 years or over whose ethnic group is Bangladeshi.

The risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males and nearly two and a half times higher for black females than white. Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for Black males and around one and a half times for black females. Significant differences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. The ONS will continue to research this unexplained increased risk of death, examining the impact of other health conditions.\u201d \n\u2022 Nick Stripe, Head of Life Events, Office for National Statistics", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcT2eYrIBnQ", "date_published": "2020-07-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
