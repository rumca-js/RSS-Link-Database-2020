ü§™ LAUGH NOW, You won't be laughing soon!

What you're referring to Linux is, in fact, Soystemd/Snap, or as I've recently taken to calling it Soystemd+Snap. I'm sorry, our Human Resources department has deprecated that scary old black box that people used to use. Please use these electron-based apps for all your computing needs.
