At the time, sisters Jessica, Camilla and Emily Staveley-Taylor had been spending a lot of time in and around Eau Claire, Wis., located about 90 minutes' drive east of The Current, working at Justin Vernon's April Base studio there. \"Working with Justin's great,\" Camilla said at the time. \"For one, he's incredibly talented, so has great ideas. Almost more than that, he has a very pure love of music, and I think that's mirrored in how he works with people and how he collaborates with people. There's no ego there. It's about him being passionate about wanting you to get the most out of this experience.\"\nWe're looking back on that experience in 2016 by sharing these videos from the day.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Outlaw\"\n3:10 \"Damn It All\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nCamilla Staveley-Taylor: vocals, guitars, ukulele\nEmily Staveley-Taylor: vocals, synths\nJessica Staveley-Taylor: vocals, guitar, keys\nDave Power: drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan; Leah Garaas\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Erik Stromstad; Andrew Broussard; Brandon Eich\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/07/16/the-staves-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2016 session in the Forum: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/07/29/the-staves-perform-in-the-forum-at-the-current\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j-MacB4pEGo", "date_published": "2020-07-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
