<p>Hosted by Richard Ayoade in a void, it was the best possible argument for scrapping in-person awards ceremonies</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/31/bafta-tv-awards-2020-full-list-of-winners">Bafta TV awards 2020: full list of winners</a></li></ul><p>By all accounts, the results of this year’s television Bafta awards would always be secondary to its delivery method. Hosted by Richard Ayoade in a silent black void, with winners either accepting their awards via Zoom or prerecorded iPhone videos, the ceremony had the potential to be a complete disaster. However, it was a refreshingly brisk and unfussily banged-out highlights reel of a show, with none of the bloated self-congratulation that usually renders this sort of thing unwatchable.</p><p>And yet the results nevertheless managed to throw up a volley of surprises. Since the Baftas effectively marked the finishing line of its global awards marathon, Fleabag was always expected to be the big winner of the night. But things didn’t completely go to plan. The first surprise of the night came during the best female performance in a comedy category. To be clear, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/apr/08/farewell-fleabag-the-most-electrifying-devastating-tv-in-years">Fleabag won this award</a>. But Phoebe Waller-Bridge did not. Instead, it went to her onscreen sister Sian Clifford. It was a result that nobody could have predicted; not least Clifford herself, whose acceptance speech was so punctuated with moments of such shock that she almost dropped the phone she was filming herself on.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/31/slimmed-down-baftas-a-happy-surprise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Why be in a city centre when nothing’s happening there, and where should you be when civilisation ends? Covid-19 has turned the housing market into an existential crisis </p><p>I went into lockdown feeling smug about almost nothing, except one small thing: right after it, whenever that was, we were going to move house. We had a buyer, we had a seller and the best bit was they were one and the same. We were basically swapping houses – no, sorry, <em>this</em> is the best bit – with a vicar.</p><p>It had been a winding, perilous road. In our first meeting (location: his house), knowing his calling, I tried to sound much more Christian than I am. But men of the cloth can always smell it when you do that. The second and third meetings (location: our house), I answered the door in a towel and in pyjamas, respectively; looking back, there wasn’t a single time I was appropriately dressed in this entire long-range encounter, except when visiting his house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/commentisfree/2020/jul/31/leaving-london-move-house-city-centre-covid-19-housing-market">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ashley Hickson-Lovence, Abir Mukherjee, Courttia Newland, Guy Gunaratne, Paul Mendez and Okechukwu Nzelu on why British writers of colour are left out of the conversation<br /></p><p>After this week’s Booker prize longlist was announced, the Times asked “Where are the new male hotshot novelists?” I was expecting to see the article discussing the brilliant fiction by men, in particular men of colour, being written at the moment, but they were only mentioned in passing. It seemed the hotshot British male novelists the Times was looking for were really British, male and white.</p><p>It’s exhausting that one of the reasons offered for the dearth of these voices is the industry’s efforts to “introduce more racial diversity to their lists”, posing diversity and inclusion once again as pitting people against each other. Ask any Black or Brown writer if they’re the reason white men are being shut out of the books world and they’ll probably shout, because the alternative is crying. In 2016, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/one-new-black-male-novelist-britain-publishing">only one debut novel from a Black British male author was published in the UK</a>. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/17/uk-publishers-lack-of-diversity-black-writers-guild">As the Black Writers’ Guild says</a>, despite efforts across the industry, change isn’t happening fast enough.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jul/31/where-are-the-hotshot-british-male-novelists-bame-authors-may-know">Continue reading...</a>

It was originally based on sorbet (<em>sgropin</em>) with vodka and lemon, with an optional prosecco top, and works as an aperitif, as dessert or as an after-dinner drink. Our version features three citrus fruits: lemon in the sorbet, bergamot in the Italicus and lime in the garnish.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jul/31/sgroppino-recipe-cocktail-lemon-sorbet-italicus-tavolino-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Trying to store every unwritten report and unfulfilled plan in your brain can be a source of anxiety </p><p>Don’t you feel it, all the time, these days: that almost physical sense of your brain just being too full? Perhaps it’s full of all the tasks you’re trying to complete while also caring for your kids; or full of worry about whether you’ll keep your job; or full of fury at the outrageous pronouncements of mendacious fools on social media, or nebulous fear for the future of humanity. Whatever the details, though, I suspect you’re familiar with the feeling that some cognitive limit is rapidly being approached.</p><p>What’s the answer? Well, large-scale socioeconomic change, competent politicians and a worldwide renewal of civic spirit. Obviously. But in the meantime, allow me to remind you of a calming life-management tip you might have forgotten, or maybe never even heard of: you really, really ought to be capturing your open loops.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/31/overtaxed-by-all-the-unfinished-tasks-hanging-over-you-there-is-a-solution">Continue reading...</a>

## I’ve booked my wife a weekly flower delivery. Who says romance is dead? | Romesh Ranganathan

<p>I imagine you already know how woefully I have missed the point</p><p>My wife and I have long argued about whether or not I am romantic. She believes romance is about thoughtful gifts and flowers and surprise dinners, whereas I believe it’s about lowering expectations to such a point that when I do anything it feels incredible. My wife approaches birthdays not knowing whether she’s going to get the handbag she has been talking about for ages, or a hastily homemade birthday card I get the kids to sign that morning: it’s a real rollercoaster.</p><p>But every now and again, I like to surprise my wife with flowers. She is always delighted, but makes such a show of being grateful and surprised that it comes across as sarcastic and ruins the moment, if I’m honest. It did occur to me, however, that it would be nice if I got her flowers more often.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jul/31/ive-booked-my-wife-a-weekly-flower-delivery-who-says-romance-is-dead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The screenwriter tells Sarah Hughes about the huge success of her nostalgic comedy, and her new project, The Deceived – a dark drama influenced by Daphne du Maurier</p><p>When you are the creator of one of the most popular sitcoms in recent years, a series that has gone from underdog to global phenomenon, the easiest option would be to rest on your laurels and write what you know. But Lisa McGee doesn’t believe in easy options. “My main thing right now is, don’t come expecting it to be funny,” she says with a laugh. “If anybody settles down to watch this expecting it to be like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/18/derry-girls-criminally-underrated-irish-sitcom-fuses-hilarity-with-political-heft">Derry Girls</a>, then they’re going to be really disappointed.”</p><p>The 39-year-old creator of the hit Channel 4 sitcom has a new series, The Deceived, airing on Channel 5 from Monday to Thursday next week – which McGee co-wrote with her husband, the actor and writer Tobias Beer. Gone are the belly laughs of Derry Girls: instead, this is an atmospheric thriller in the Daphne du Maurier mould. “Basically, me and my husband really like old movies like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/dial-m-for-murder">Dial M for Murder</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/rebecca">Rebecca</a> and wanted to create a show that paid homage to that genre and was also just a really good thriller where you can’t wait to find out what happened next.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jul/31/lisa-mcgee-derry-girls-the-deceived-channel-5">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Trump overestimated how much voters fear ‘antifa’ - and underestimated how terrible his ham-fisted authoritarianism would look<br /></p><p>Opponents of Donald Trump often describe him as a “<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/trump-genius/609142/">political genius</a>” who has a cunning understanding of the anxieties and fears of American society, and is able to create and use crises to his favor. The current standoff in Portland shows, yet again, that this is not the case. While his alleged fight against antifa will satisfy some of his far-right supporters, it increasingly risks further alienating the so-called “moderate” Republicans – which seems mostly used to describe better-off pocketbook Republican voters – who are already feeling uneasy over his Covid-19 handling and the economic fallout of the pandemic.</p><p>An almost ignored aspect of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is that Trump failed to use it to push through his authoritarian agenda by increasing executive powers, weakening the powers of other institutions, like Congress, and marginalizing dissent, for instance by banning demonstrations. Almost all <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/wartime-coronavirus-powers-state-of-emergency">other countries</a> implemented a more repressive approach to Covid-19, including those governed by progressive parties (like Spain), while most far-right governments used it to push through draconian repressive measures (such as <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/05/29/ending-hungarys-state-emergency-wont-end-authoritarianism">Hungary</a> and <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/why-we-should-be-worried-about-indias-response-coronavirus">India</a>).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jul/31/trump-portland-antifa-voters-miscalculated">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Christopher Nolan’s cerebro-tech thriller may be short on story, but makes up for it with staggering fantasy set pieces</p><p>With <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/27/tenet-christopher-nolan-film-release">Christopher Nolan’s new film Tenet</a> doomed to arrive like Achilles racing the tortoise in Zeno’s paradox, approaching and approaching, forever closing the gap but never quite here, it is an interesting time for his adored <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2010/jul/08/christopher-nolan-inception">cerebro-tech thriller Inception</a> to get a re-release on streaming platforms. It’s a measure of Nolan’s towering prestige that a film made a mere 10 years ago can be eligible for classic reassessment status, but there’s also something disconcerting about it.</p><p>Rightly or wrongly, Nolan fans and the industry generally had been encouraged to believe in Tenet as the morale-boosting new dawn for post-Covid theatrical life – the flagship for cinema as challenging, spectacular entertainment. So, inevitably, it looks as if Inception is somehow being offered as second best, or as a warmup act hustled hastily on stage to keep the audience quiet because the (similar) main event is still stuck in traffic miles away.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/31/inception-review-christopher-nolan-virtual-reality-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The superstar’s Lion King-inspired visual album is a feast for the eyes, celebrating the beauty and richness of African cultures with emotion and power</p><p>Beyoncé’s second visual album after Lemonade is truly worth the wait. An accompaniment to her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/jul/19/beyonce-the-lion-king-the-gift-review-superstar-shows-impeccable-taste">Lion King album The Gift</a>, to describe Black Is King as just a visual album is an understatement – it is a film in and of itself. Black Is King is a global contemporary reimagining of the story of The Lion King across several countries and three continents, following a human Simba’s journey with Beyoncé as an ethereal narrator and guide. The film uses sound clips from The Lion King to assist with transitions that shape the story, and all of the protagonists from the film are recreated as real-life characters with more personality and substance. The hyenas are a devilish biker gang, and Mood 4 Eva depicts life with Timon and Pumba in a lavish mansion.</p><p>Fundamentally, Black Is King speaks to the beauty and richness of blackness without it seeming grotesquely wealthy or too contrived. The film offers varied production styles: sometimes minimal, with Beyoncé singing in vast open spaces on songs such as Bigger; other sequences are loud and colourful, with vibrant imagery and high energy dancers on My Power. Black Is King is a visual feast; it provides several slow-panning scenes of stillness where we absorb the striking beauty and duality of bright colours against deep brown tones. On <a href="https://youtu.be/agCgvFTJeRs">Already</a>, we see dancers celebrate under the red, black and green Pan-African flag designed by Marcus Garvey: a truly unapologetic statement of black unity in a time that feels like the world has forgotten us.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jul/31/black-is-king-review-beyonce-disney-plus-lion-king">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Even if workers in England go back to eating the same old Pret sandwich at their desks, with the virus at large, there is no normal</p><p>There is a joke format that became popular on social media in the early stages of lockdown. Someone would post something speculative about when a certain aspect of life would return to normal, say, when the restrictions on the amount of daily outdoor exercise would be lifted. Then someone else would reply to, or share, their post with the caption: “Normal? Oh we ain’t never going back to normal.” I use the word “joke” generously, and when I say popular I mean “a lot of people did it”, rather than “a lot of people liked it”.</p><p>This type of cocky, unevidenced prophesying has been one of the more annoying responses to coronavirus.

<p>As China comes under attack abroad, nationalist sentiment at home is being stoked – at the expense of other voices</p><p>For days, the US consulate in the Chinese city of Chengdu was not just a site for curious onlookers but for residents eager to express pride in their country. Some waved the Chinese flag while others set off fireworks. In <a href="https://twitter.com/EQ392766/status/1288287105525919747">one video,</a> a woman said she was “extremely happy” to see <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/27/crowds-wave-chinese-flags-and-take-selfies-as-us-consulate-closes-in-chengdu">the consulate close</a>. “We have kicked out one more hub for spies!” she said, smiling as she pointed at the building.</p><p>In another video, widely circulated on Chinese social media, a CNN reporter attempting to broadcast is drowned out by a group belting out a patriotic Chinese song. The crowd sings cheerfully, if discordantly: “Praising our beloved motherland as it goes towards prosperity and power.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/china-is-powerful-now-beijings-aggressive-global-stance-sparks-wave-of-nationalism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The death of George Floyd in the US provoked massive anti-racism protests in the UK. Guardian reporter Aamna Mohdin discusses what she learned when she interviewed 50 young Britons at the heart of those rallies</p><p>Following the resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement in the UK and across the world, Guardian reporters <strong>Aamna </strong><strong>Mohdin</strong> and Lucy Campbell interviewed 50 young black Britons, many of whom have been at the heart of the recent anti-racism protests, to find out what was driving them and ask what changes they would like to see in their lifetimes.</p><p>Aamna talks to<strong> Rachel Humphreys </strong>about those conversations.
