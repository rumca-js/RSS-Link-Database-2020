Testimony of a French traveler of the time: “[. ..] always so inconvenient, always strung in the middle in heavy rosaries, it continues to break from time to time its link to go scatter on the ground, so that it is necessary to collect one after the other 600 of these small slices to raise only the value of 18 French sous ... ”(in Régis Antoine, L'Histoire curieuse des monnaies coloniales, ed. ACL, Paris, 1986, p. 117).
