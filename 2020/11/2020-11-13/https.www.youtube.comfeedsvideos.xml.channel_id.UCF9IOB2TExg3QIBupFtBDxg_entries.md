Effect of pre-exposure use of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 mortality: a population-based cohort study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus using the OpenSAFELY platform 

Lancet, 5th November, MRC

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(20)30378-7/fulltext

Hydroxychloroquine

Pre¬exposure (as opposed to post¬exposure) prophylactic 

Inhibit entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into epithelial cells in vitro

No evidence of reduced mortality when treating patients with COVID-19

Methods

Observational

Population-based cohort study

Approximately 40% of the general population in England

Association between ongoing use before COVID-19

Compared with non-users of hydroxychloroquine

Risk of COVID-19 mortality

People with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus

n = 194, 637 with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus

n = 30, 569 received two or more prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine

March 1 and July 13, 2020

547 deaths

Users (n= 30,569)

70 deaths

IFR = 0.23%

Non – users (n = 164,068)

IFR = 0.22%

An absolute difference of 0·008%
Accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunosuppressive drugs, and geographical 
region
No association with COVID-19 mortality was observed
