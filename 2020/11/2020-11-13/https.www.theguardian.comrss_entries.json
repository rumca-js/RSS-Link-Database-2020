But the clip has gone viral since being posted recently by Spanish organisation <a href=\"https://www.musicaparadespertar.com/\">M\u00fasica Para Despertar</a> (Music to Awaken), which promotes the value of music for those living with Alzheimer\u2019s. Many of the details accompanying the video on its journey around the internet have been erroneous. Marta Cinta was not a member of the \u201cNew York Ballet\u201d (there\u2019s no such company) or the actual New York City Ballet, but seems to have run her own dance company in the city; the ballerina performing in the intercut video is not her but Ulyana Lopatkina, who is not even dancing Swan Lake but Mikhail Fokine\u2019s The Dying Swan. Yet none of that takes away the impact of watching someone seemingly light up and have their memories unlocked by the power of melody.
