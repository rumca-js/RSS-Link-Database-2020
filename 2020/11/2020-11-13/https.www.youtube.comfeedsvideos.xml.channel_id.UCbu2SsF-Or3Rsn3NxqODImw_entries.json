Let's take a look at each one. \n\nMAJOR SPOLIERS AHEAD!\u00a0\u00a0\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has a few endings to its single-player\u00a0campaign mode. Players are given the option to save the world by preventing a nuclear war, or teaming up with Perseus to commence the launch and deter the Americans to a dead end.\u00a0Throughout the story,\u00a0you\u2019re given many options\u00a0to progress the way you want. But when it comes to this final mission, a lot more is at stake and your actions\u00a0are a matter of life or death. Here\u2019s how your options break down.\u00a0\n\nAfter some mental interrogation, your character Bell wakes up and finds themselves with Adler and the American team. You\u2019re\u00a0strapped to a chair and given one choice:\u00a0Tell Adler the truth about Perseus\u2019 location and help prevent a nuclear catastrophe, or lie to him, divert the American team to another location, and help Perseus\u00a0vaporize all of Europe. If you tell Adler the truth, you get the canonical ending where you, Mason, Woods, and Adler head to the\u00a0Solovetsky\u00a0islands and\u00a0stop the launch from happening. Perseus escapes but America wins this fight and saves all of Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLying to Adler sends you to the Duga array in the Ukraine- a distraction for Perseus to start the\u00a0launch\u00a0with\u00a0no Americans in his way.\u00a0If you unlocked the secret door in Hudson\u2019s\u00a0base\u00a0prior to this mission, you also have a chance to not only turn your back on the US team, but plan an ambush that leads to the deaths of Woods, Mason, Kim and Adler by your own hands. Once the US team is killed, you and the mysterious man (who turns out NOT to be Perseus) launch the nukes and blame the United States.\u00a0Be on the lookout for\u00a0GameSpot\u2019s\u00a0Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War coverage with its\u00a0upcoming review and guides to both multiplayer and\u00a0zombies\u00a0mode.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhQeqWQ8ppQ", "date_published": "2020-11-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5's DualSense Is Revolutionary For First Person Shooters", "description": "Jean-Luc talks about how the PlayStation 5's new DualSense controller is a massive game changer for first-person shooters after experiencing it with Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2D3O8sMayQ", "date_published": "2020-11-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Campaign First Look", "description": "After playing Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War\u2019s campaign twice, reviewer Kallie Plagge gives her first impressions of the game\u2019s single player, before delivering her final verdict on the game\u2019s Zombies mode, and multiplayer servers.\n\nAfter playing Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War's campaign twice, Kallie Plagge gives her first impressions of just the game's main story.

We also finally ask Phil what he thinks of the nicknames Big Phil and Phil Sponsors, and he picks his favourite.\n\nBut that\u2019s not all!

We already compared the game's Xbox One X version to its Series X upgrade, with the Series X version having clear improvements over last gen, but what differences can we expect between Series X and Sony's new PlayStation 5?\n\nIn the video above, we take the same Assassin's Creed Valhalla save file and, thanks to the cloud, use it on both platforms, to compare as fairly as possible. We also used the same capture device and in-game settings. We compare the fast travel load times between Norway and England, and take a look at how the visuals and performance differ between the platforms. You'll see that the differences are negligible, but a keen eye may be able to spot them.\n\nTake a look at the video to discern the key differences between the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game. If you currently own Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS4 or Xbox One,, the game upgrades to the next gen version for free when you get a new console, and you can use your cloud save to pick up where you left off.
