Dr. Terrence Cash claims to be the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Greenlight Advantage Group Inc. as well as its related companies. Dr. Cash calls himself the Nation's #1 Business, Money, Wealth Manager... but the truth is far different from first appearances. Dr. Cash has been outed by the DOJ and SEC as hiding a felony past, and allegedly has faked more than that.

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.
