The rapper ultimately stayed loyal to his crew in court, but the chokehold of conspiracy law also left him with few other options. In our final chapter of Bobby's story, we follow his legal drama: cycling through defense lawyers, being strong-armed by prosecutors and making last-ditch outbursts in court. Finally, we sit down with Bobby in prison as he looks to his future on the other side of his cell. \n\nARTWORK by Dale Edwin Murray / MUSIC by Kassa Overall / VIDEO by Renee Klahr\n\nLISTEN TO MORE EPISODES\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLy2PCKGkKRVYaJh9C_eB22ryDQakzZ0Xd\n\nWHAT'S \"LOUDER THAN A RIOT\"?\nRhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. \"Louder Than A Riot\" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles \u2014 the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.\n\nWe'd love to hear your thoughts, questions and feedback.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | November 18, 2020\nFor her Tiny Desk (home) concert, Adrianne Lenker's home is a camper trailer parked somewhere in Joshua Tree National Park. It's the appropriate setting for the five songs she performs from her new album, tunes birthed in a wooden cabin in Massachusetts.\n\nThe songs, the words, the voice of Adrianne Lenker has been at the top of my year-end musical loves for the past five years, more so than any other artist. It began with her work as the singer and songwriter on Big Thief's electric debut album, Masterpiece, in 2016 and runs through this year's two sister solo albums, one titled songs and the other instrumentals. Those albums contain nothing more than an acoustic guitar, voice, and the bug, birds, and creatures captured while recording.\n\nHer yearning voice, simultaneously frail and strong, draws me to those songs \u2014 songs about people, everyday life, everyday death, and ordinary places. All the while, she picks the tunes out of her guitar or paints the rhythms with a brush. These are songs worth spending time with, simple on first listen, but so much more profound once you live with them. \n\nSET LIST\n    \"zombie girl\"\n    \"two reverse\"\n    \"dragon eyes\"\n    \"anything\"\n    \"ingydar\"\n\nMUSICIANS\n    Adrianne Lenker: vocals, guitar\n\nCREDITS\n    Video: Vanessa Haddad, Adam Gundersheimer\n    Audio: Scott Cornish\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\n    Producer: Bob Boilen\n    Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\n    Audio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\n    Associate Producer: Bobby Carter\n    Tiny Production Team: Kara Frame, Maia Stern\n    Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey\n    Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKcQyUszdhw", "date_published": "2020-11-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
