## boygenius  - three songs at The Current (2018)

Two years ago — Nov. 17, 2018 — boygenius visited The Current to record a live session hosted by Mac Wilson. Although the word "supergroup" certainly seems to apply, the members of boygenius — Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus — don't think of themselves in those terms. "I like just 'group'," Baker said, "because I feel like that fits more with the ethos of this having no demand or specific hyper-expectation around it."

To hear Baker, Bridgers and Dacus explain it, one of the joys of boygenius is not only the fact that the band came together spontaneously and serendipitously, but also that they really enjoy working and performing together. "I believe in these songs even more so because they're Phoebe's and Julien's songs, too," Dacus said. "And I'm a fan of theirs, so I can hype this project more comfortably than my own stuff. And it's just a lot of fun, too. It's like a third of the pressure but three times the payoff."

Watch the full set by boygenius above.
