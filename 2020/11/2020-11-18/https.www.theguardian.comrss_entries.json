It\u2019s complicated, violent, intelligent \u2013 and tons of fun</p><p>Considering the subject matter, viewers who aren\u2019t familiar with the 2013 James McBride novel The Good Lord Bird could be forgiven for expecting a sombre tone from this adaptation, airing on Sky Atlantic. The story follows the last years of the American abolitionist John Brown, whose raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859 \u2013 an attempt to initiate a slave revolt \u2013 is widely believed to have been the prelude to the American civil war.</p><p>But this series is far from sombre. It is a waggish and raucous tale that sets out its stall from the beginning, when it opens with a note that \u201cAll of this is true\u201d, quickly followed by another, adding, \u201cMost of it happened\u201d. The story is narrated by Henry Shackleford, known to Brown as Henrietta, or Little Onion, owing to one of the many misunderstandings and mishaps that urge the story onwards. Henry is a 13-year-old slave, freed by Brown and then adopted, sort of, by him, almost entirely by accident; Brown\u2019s bluster and momentum hit such a pace that he doesn\u2019t stop to realise that Henry is not the girl he thinks she is. But being a girl has its advantages in the bloody world Brown and his \u201cabolitionists\u2019 army\u201d inhabit, and Henry has an instinctive knack for survival.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/18/the-good-lord-bird-review-ethan-hawke-shines-in-riotous-slavery-abolition-caper\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/18/the-good-lord-bird-review-ethan-hawke-shines-in-riotous-slavery-abolition-caper", "date_published": "2020-11-18 23:10:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Medvedev dismantles Djokovic to clinch ATP Finals last-four spot", "description": "<ul><li>Medvedev prevails 6-3, 6-3 against Serb</li><li>Zverev defeats Schwartzman </li></ul><p>Daniil Medvedev, saving his best tennis for the last stretch of the season, thrashed the world No 1 Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-3 on the fourth evening of the ATP Tour Finals to reach the semi-finals of the 12th and final London edition of the event.
