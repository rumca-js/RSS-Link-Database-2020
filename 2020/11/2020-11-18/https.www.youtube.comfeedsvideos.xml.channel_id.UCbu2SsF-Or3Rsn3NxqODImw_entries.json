But like many Call of Duty stories, it only gestures at a greater point and stops short of making it. It's overall a fun action-movie story that absolutely delivers on the quintessential Black Ops twists and turns, but it ultimately walks back its more interesting and relevant questions--though I was completely invested in the story for the entire duration.\u201d", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxCyVczFFis", "date_published": "2020-11-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Demon's Souls on PS5: 7 Beginner's Tips", "description": "The infamous Demon's Souls has returned on PS5, and it's still hard as hell.
