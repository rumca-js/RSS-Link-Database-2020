Let's say you run a fortune 500 company. And you wanna get an edge on a business competitor that’s been on your tail. If you could get your hands on your competitors proprietary technology, you could turn the tide on profits! Maybe instead of getting your hands on their technology secrets, maybe you could use some photos of your competitor’s CEO in a “compromised” position? Maybe some internal documents could help?

Spying never changes - it’s all about getting information - intelligence from other humans. Some people will get trained through government intelligence agencies, then quit to sell those skills to the private sector. It’s so bad that some insiders say this intelligence “brain drain” is hurting US national security.

Corporate espionage is expensive. It requires a lot of manpower and expertise that not many people have. On top of that, espionage doesn’t always yield results. So how far people are willing to go to spy on their business enemies depends on how much money is involved.

The major espionage firms claim that they don’t do anything shady. One reason is that unless the intel they get is used for shady things, intel obtained in a shady way isn’t admissible in court. BUT, depending on the laws of the country they’re operating in, almost anything goes.

For every corporate espionage assignment, you’ll get a target to go after: this can be just plain information about something, documents, photographs, etc. Now, not everyone would be willing to betray their company, so the first step is to create a psychological profile of your ideal mole.

Another twist on this method is that if you seduce them but they’re still giving you resistance on the juicy stuff you’re really after, you can try to persuade them to reveal more inconsequential, less important details that are easier to squeeze out - but are still illegal to share none-the-less.

If there’s a king in this corporate espionage game - in this economic espionage game - it’s without a doubt China. If you’ve watched this channel, you know that China’s long term goal is to surpass the US as the world’s greatest superpower.

Part of that strategy is for China to become the market leader in vital industries like tech, aerospace, ai, energy, medicine, biotech, etc. And to become the market leader in any of these fields, you need to develop cutting-edge technology. Which is why China been involved in corporate espionage case after corporate espionage case.

Does the US and other countries spy on foreign businesses? Yes!
But there’s no denying that China is the undisputed master at this.
