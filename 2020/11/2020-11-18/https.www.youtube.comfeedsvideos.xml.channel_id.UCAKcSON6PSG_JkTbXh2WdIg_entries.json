Although Lane had performed at the MPR booth at the Minnesota State Fair earlier that year, she made her first in-studio appearance in November. Since then, Lane visited our studio again in 2017, and she and her band performed at Rock the Garden 2018. Watch three performances by Nikki Lane, recorded live in our studio.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Right Time\" (2014)\n3:06 \"Highway Queen\" (2017)\n6:47 \"Jackpot\" (2017)\n\nPERSONNEL\nNikki Lane \u2013 guitar and vocals\nBen Eyestone \u2013 drums (2014)\nEric Whitman \u2013 bass \nAlex Mu\u00f1oz \u2013 lead guitar\nTaylor Powell \u2013 drums (2017)\nJonathan Tyler \u2013 guitar (2017)\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/11/18/nikki-lane-performs-live-in-the-current-studio\n2014 Guitar Collection interview:\nthecurrent.org/feature/2014/11/26/the-current-s-guitar-collection-nikki-lane-\n2017 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/03/15/highway-queen-nikki-lane-makes-a-stop-at-the-current\n2018 Rock the Garden set:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/07/02/nikki-lane-delivers-a-blast-of-sunshinetinged-americana-at-rock-the-garden\n2019 feature on Avett Brothers' \"High Steppin'\" video (Nikki Lane was wardrobe supervisor)\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/07/25/purple-charlotte-steppers-club-high-steppin-dancers-avett-brothers-video\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#nikkilane", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OReeqS6tzGY", "date_published": "2020-11-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "boygenius  - three songs at The Current (2018)", "description": "Two years ago \u2014 Nov. 17, 2018 \u2014 boygenius visited The Current to record a live session hosted by Mac Wilson. Although the word \"supergroup\" certainly seems to apply, the members of boygenius \u2014 Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus \u2014 don't think of themselves in those terms. \"I like just 'group',\" Baker said, \"because I feel like that fits more with the ethos of this having no demand or specific hyper-expectation around it.\"\n\nTo hear Baker, Bridgers and Dacus explain it, one of the joys of boygenius is not only the fact that the band came together spontaneously and serendipitously, but also that they really enjoy working and performing together. \"I believe in these songs even more so because they're Phoebe's and Julien's songs, too,\" Dacus said. \"And I'm a fan of theirs, so I can hype this project more comfortably than my own stuff. And it's just a lot of fun, too. It's like a third of the pressure but three times the payoff.\"\n\nWatch the full set by boygenius above.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Souvenir\"\n3:26 \"Me & My Dog\"\n6:33 \"Ketchum, ID\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nJulien Baker \u2013 vocals, mandolin, piano\nPhoebe Bridgers \u2013 vocals, guitar\nLucy Dacus - vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/11/17/boygenius-perform-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#boygenius #phoebebridgers #lucydacus #julienbaker", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBTmxpDR-rM", "date_published": "2020-11-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
