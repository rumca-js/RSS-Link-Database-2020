Immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 assessed for greater than six months after infection 

(16th November, Institute for Immunology CA, and University of California)

Humans make:

SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies

CD4+ T cells (helpers)

CD8+ T cells (killers)

Memory B cells

Neutralizing antibodies have generally not correlated with lessened COVID-19 disease severity

Passive prophylactic antibodies limits disease in animals

Less so after infection

Clinical hepatitis is prevented by vaccine-elicited immune memory even in the absence of circulating antibodies

Six months or more is usually required to ascertain the durability of immune memory

Cross-sectional study

N = 185 

41 cases, more than 6 months 

Recovered COVID-19 cases

43% male, 57% female

Mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 cases

Multiple sites throughout the United States

92% of subjects were never hospitalized

7% of subjects were hospitalized

97% symptomatic

Results, B cells

Spike IgG was relatively stable over 6+ months

Spike-specific memory B cells were more abundant at 6 months than at 1 month…

detected in almost all COVID-19 cases

No apparent half-life at 5+ months post-infection

Smallpox vaccine, 60+ years

Influenza infection, 90 years

Results, T cells

SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3-5 months

Decay of circulating SARS-CoV-2- specific CD8+ T cell is consistent with what has been reported for another acute virus
 
Smallpox also uses CD4+ T cells, t1/2 of ~10 years

T cell memory might reach a more stable plateau, or slower decay phase, later than the first 6 months post-infection. 

Each component of SARS-CoV-2 immune memory exhibited distinct kinetics

Immunity and reinfection

Memory B and T cell responses can take 3-5 days to successfully respond to an infection 

SARS-CoV T cells 17 years after the initial infection

SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are all betacoronaviruses

SARS-CoV-2 is most similar to SARS-CoV-1

Followed by MERS-CoV (2012)

It doesn't matter that we were all doing social distancing, it doesn't matter that I'm fit as a butcher's dog, feel great  – so many people do in my circumstances. 
And actually it doesn't matter that I've had the disease and I'm bursting with antibodies.
We've got to interrupt the spread of the disease…and one of the ways we can do that now is by self isolating for 14 days when contacted by Test and Trace.

PFIZER AND BIONTECH CONCLUDE PHASE 3 STUDY OF COVID-19 VACCINE CANDIDATE, MEETING ALL PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINTS

Wednesday, November 18, 2020 - 06:59am 

Phase 3, 27th July

Primary efficacy analysis, 95% effective

(p less than 0.0001), 9, 999 out of 10,000

high rate of protection against COVID-19 can be achieved very fast after the first 30 µg dose

beginning 28 days after the first dose

170 confirmed case

10 severe cases

N = 41,135

42% of global participants and 30% of U.S. participants have racially and ethnically diverse backgrounds

41% of global and 45% of U.S. participants are 56-85 years of age

Placebo group

162 infections

9 severe cases

Vaccine group

8 infections

1 severe case

Efficacy was consistent across age, gender, race and ethnicity demographics

Observed efficacy in adults over 65 years of age was over 94%

Two month safety test

Safety data milestone required by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Emergency Use 

Authorization (EUA) has been achieved

Side effects

FDA adverse events rules

https://www.fda.gov/media/73679/download

Well tolerated across all populations

No serious safety concerns observed

Mostly less than 2%

Grade 3 adverse event 

Fatigue 3.8% 

Headache 2.0%

Plan to submit within days to the FDA for EUA and share data with other regulatory agencies around the globe

expect to produce globally up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020

1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021

Pfizer is confident in its vast experience, expertise and existing cold-chain infrastructure to distribute the vaccine around the world

Manufacturing

Germany 

Belgium

3 US sites

Logistics

Specially designed, temperature-controlled thermal shippers

Utilizing dry ice

Maintain temperature conditions of -70°C±10°C
