Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nSuraya Mohamed | November 23, 2020\nRecorded in his hometown of Detroit, KEM's Tiny Desk performance is light, welcoming and beautifully decorated. So is his music. After almost 20 years of recording R&B hits like \"I Can't Stop Loving You\" and \"Love Calls,\" he still comforts my soul with his sultry voice and simple, yet satisfying melodies.\n\nFans have been waiting since 2014 for a new album and it finally dropped earlier this year. Love Always Wins is filled with his signature romantic style. With accompaniments by veteran musicians, Michael \"Nomad\" Ripoll on guitar and David McMurray on saxophone, we get to hear three songs from the album in this lovely set.\n\nThe first, \"Friend Today,\" poignantly articulates a love for our fellow humans: \"There's a roll like thunder / They killing our babies, Lord / They headed straight for the border / And we can no longer ignore it.\" KEM wrote \"Not Before You,\" a classic romantic love song, as a dedication to his wife, Erica. \"Lonely\" ends the set with an upbeat, hopeful vibe: \"There's a life waiting for you / In your brokenness.\" It's an affirmation that personal struggles can end in true happiness.\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Friend Today\"\n\"Not Before You\"\n\"Lonely\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nKEM: vocals, keys\nMichael \"Nomad\" Ripoll: guitar\nDavid McMurray: saxophone\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Herman Jenkins\nAudio: Kristofer Truzzi\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Suraya Mohamed\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrDA0ajZuWU", "date_published": "2020-11-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
