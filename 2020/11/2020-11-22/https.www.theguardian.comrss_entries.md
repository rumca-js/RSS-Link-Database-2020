## Arteta angry at Pépé over 'unacceptable' red card in Arsenal stalemate at Leeds

<p>It would be unfair to reduce this match to a single flashpoint given that the absence of goals says nothing of an absorbing, often breathless contest that deserved far better. Leeds should have deepened Arsenal’s anxieties but their annoyance at not doing so can be explained by a skirmish that tipped the scales firmly in their favour.</p><p>Nicolas Pépé and Ezgjan Alioski had been engaged in a low-key running battle during the early stages of the second half and, after a bout of niggling outside the Leeds penalty area with the ball several yards away, the home left-back tumbled to the floor clutching his face. It took a VAR check to apprise Anthony Taylor that Pépé had pushed his forehead into that of his adversary, the motion clear enough to be classed as violent conduct even if Alioski’s reaction was almost as reprehensible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/22/leeds-arsenal-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

We’ve had <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/12/what-does-the-r-number-of-coronavirus-mean-video-explainer">to digest R</a> (a virus’s reproduction number) and PCR (the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/the-two-tests-that-will-help-to-predict-spread-of-covid-19">polymerase chain reaction</a> method of testing). And now there’s mRNA. This last one has featured heavily in recent news reports because of the spectacular results of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/18/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-95-effective-and-safe-further-tests-show">two</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/16/moderna-covid-vaccine-candidate-almost-95-effective-trials-show">new</a> mRNA vaccines against coronavirus. It stands for “messenger ribonucleic acid”, a label familiar enough if you studied biology at O-level or GCSE, but otherwise hardly a household name. Even in the field of vaccine research, if you had said as recently as 10 years ago that you could protect people from infections by injecting them with mRNA, you would have provoked some puzzled looks.</p><p>Essentially, mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (“transcribed”) into a piece of mRNA, which in turn gets “read” by the cell’s tools for synthesising proteins. In the case of an mRNA vaccine, the virus’s mRNA is injected into the muscle, and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins – which can’t by themselves cause disease – just as if they’d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that, we hope, lasts for some time. It’s so beautifully simple it almost seems like science fiction. But last week we learned that it was true.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/22/mrna-vaccines-covid-signal-new-era-disease-prevention-science">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A zesty fish dish and the sweet scent of baking apples</p><p>In a wretched year, brief moments of joy are to be cherished all the more. Today, cold, damp and dealing with a blanket of sodden leaves in the garden, I catch the smell of baking apples coming through the open kitchen door. A hint of fruit slowly building to a froth and the scent of browning butter and sugar which, albeit briefly, puts my world to rights. A dish of small, rosy dessert apples whose sweetness intensifies in the oven, which we will eat with homemade blackberry and apple ice-cream. The ice-cream will melt slowly over the fruit, forming a blissful, apple-scented puddle lying in wait at the bottom of our dishes.</p><p>Halibut steaks have been marinaded until ready to be grilled until their edges blacken in the heat</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/22/nigel-slaters-recipes-for-halibut-and-baked-apples">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Covid-19 has dealt a heavy blow to Birmingham’s glitzy city centre led by retail – and it’s revealing other deep fault lines</p><p>When Andy Street wants to show off the best of Birmingham to visitors up from London, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlands starts his tour in Centenary Square, a public space the length of two football pitches. To the west stands the International Convention Centre (ICC) and the Symphony Hall; to the north, the Birmingham Rep theatre and the new Library of Birmingham; HSBC’s new UK headquarters lies to the south, while to the east – where Street marches off – is a £700m development optimistically named Paradise. The square and its surroundings, Street claims, is “a statement that this place has refound its self-confidence”.</p><p>Perhaps it is. But the buildings that surround the square tell another story of a modern city. The ICC was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jan/16/birminghams-nec-group-sold-private-equity-company-307m" title="">sold off by the council</a> five years ago to help cover the cost of a £1.1bn equal pay bill after thousands of women had been paid less than men for doing similar jobs. The Birmingham Rep is currently closed and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jul/10/birmingham-rep-may-make-40-percent-roles-redundant-covid-19-crisis" title="">40% of the staff</a> are likely to lose their jobs. The Library of Birmingham cost £188m, which the city couldn’t afford – and led to cuts in opening times, staff and books at libraries across the city and even the shiny new centrepiece itself. HSBC is supposed to bring 2,200 people into the city centre every day but, since Covid-19, the proportion of staff coming in, Street estimates, is around 35%. He is confident that, once Paradise is complete, the new office blocks will be full and the restaurants busy, but pinning one’s economic hopes on city-centre jobs feels optimistic in the midst of a pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/22/has-britains-second-largest-city-reached-breaking-point">Continue reading...</a>

## Luke Abbott: Translate review – lush and cavernous

<p>(Border Community)<br />Creepy film music meets bucolic dance on the Norfolk producer’s cosmic third album</p><p>Sinister and grandiose, hectic and bucolic, Norfolk producer <a href="https://www.lukeabbottmusic.com/">Luke Abbott</a>’s third album accretes big sense impressions from some wildly disparate sources. Somehow in <em>Translate</em>, his first solo artist album in six years and third overall, you find echoes of Boards of Canada and Dario Argento horror film soundtracks, of the beatific glide of Kraftwerk and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcQ-UlKfJBg">the cold beauty of systems music</a>: all this and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YpUkK-1GlwA">sylph-like tunes too</a>. Abbott has a jazz sideline – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNEmFHrdNdA">Szun Waves</a> – and <a href="https://lukeabbottmusic.bandcamp.com/album/music-from-the-edge-of-an-island">composes film music</a>; here, you can hear the latter but not the former.</p><p>Having built a “speaker-henge” in order to achieve the cosmic wraparound sound he was after in the studio, Abbott says he hopes to be able to tour this lush, cavernous record in full quadrophonic effect after the pandemic. Fingers crossed he will, because tracks such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veZRYThtOug">Earthship</a> pair three-dimensional modular synth progressions with creepy found sounds, while others, like Living Dust, muster skitters and wub-wub to generative and strangely meditative ends. River Flow, meanwhile, conveys the ache of classical strings, and Feed Me Shapes ships in actual guitars for a finishing Velvet Underground touch. Bravo. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/22/luke-abbott-translate-review">Continue reading...</a>

## How Boris Johnson attempted a grand relaunch – only to be sunk by himself  | Andrew Rawnsley

A terrible gaffe, another example of rule breaking and a scandalous misappropriation of public money. It’s been just another week in the office for the prime minister<p>It is not unusual for a jaded and jiggered prime minister to try to relaunch himself. It is unusual for this to happen quite so early in a premiership. Boris Johnson’s attempt comes less than a year since <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2019/dec/12/uk-general-election-2019-full-results-live-labour-conservatives-tories" title="">he won an election</a> that was hailed by Tories as a stonking victory. How he yearns to return to those pre-pandemic days of hype and glory when his party adored him and the world seemed to be at his feet.</p><p>The context for attempting a relaunch appeared to be quite promising. The dark pall cast over his premiership by Covid has been somewhat lifted by reports of success from <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54993652" title="">three different projects</a> to develop a vaccine. This cannot efface the government’s serial bungling of the response to the crisis, nor make us forget that Britain has the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54905018" title="">highest death toll</a> in Europe, but it offers some hope to Number 10 that public morale will be raised and voter discontent eased by the thought that relief is in prospect. The vaccine news has had some tranquillising effect on previously mutinous Conservative MPs. Those of the libertarian right who hate the Covid restrictions have had the wind knocked out of their contention that we ought to “learn to live with the virus”. It is trickier to argue for a policy that would lead to more Covid-related deaths when a vaccine is on the horizon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/22/how-boris-johnson-attempted-a-grand-relaunch-only-to-be-sunk-by-himself">Continue reading...</a>

It’s tempting to say that those who create must resist self-censorship. But as I found out, that’s easier said than done<p>This column is about a room. It’s definitely not about: 1) Why can’t I say the things I want to say? 2) Grrr, the culture war or 3) Why I quit Twitter. But there will be moments when it seems like I am writing those things. The one I’m most worried about is the first one, because I want to get into why some of us are hesitant to express ourselves truly, but I don’t want to mention free expression or free speech. I’m not stupid.</p><p>I’ll start with a couple of dispatches from the culture war last week. The first is Radio 1 ruining Christmas by not broadcasting homophobic language to our kids.

<p>A Scot’s success led to uproar in 1994 – but not this year, with the triumph of Douglas Stuart. Maybe the award is growing up</p><p>Representation in fiction: why does it matter? The reasons are legion, and obvious. If, for example, you grow up reading books in which you see nobody who looks – either literally or figuratively – like you, then there are consequences. It shapes your idea of a default citizen, of the value of who and what is written about, and of the hierarchy of imaginative possibility. And if – as artists and those who follow them largely believe – the imagination should be a place of liberation and equality, in which language and ideas are the only currencies worth anything, that is a problem.</p><p>It was for Douglas Stuart, whose debut novel <em>Shuggie Bain</em> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/19/douglas-stuart-wins-booker-prize-for-debut-shuggie-bain" title="">won the Booker prize last week</a>. Stuart has followed the classic trajectory of the overnight success: now 44, he wrote his book only after overcoming his internal feelings of illegitimacy – the common anxiety that amounts to an anti-entitlement, a belief that writing novels is for other people – and then saw it rejected by numerous publishers. His life was hardly a bust – he had left his native Glasgow for New York and became an accomplished fashion designer – and yet, he wasn’t a novelist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/22/new-voices-now-speak-louder-than-old-giants-booker-prize-douglas-stuart-shuggie-bain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fact that almost everyone’s in the nude is the least remarkable thing about this deadpan delight from Peaky Blinders director Tim Mielants</p><p>For most British filmgoers, mentions of naturism will automatically summon up visions of Sid James and Bernard Bresslaw hyperventilating over a documentary about naked holidaying in <em>Carry on Camping.</em> Nothing could be further from the tone of this Belgian tragicomedy, a wry and oddly moving tale set in a world largely unencumbered by clothing, but riddled with intrigue, deceit, and the promise of self-discovery.</p><p>On a remote naturist campsite in the Ardennes, handyman Patrick (Kevin Janssens), son of the camp’s owners, worries over the loss of his hammer. Its absence is driven home by the empty space on his meticulously ordered tool rack, a void outlining the exact shape of his anxiety. Patrick’s father Rudy (Josse De Pauw) is dismissive, convinced that his son has simply been careless with his possession. But when Rudy dies and Patrick inherits the camp, his desire to find the missing tool becomes an obsession. Those around him think he’s simply projecting his bereaved grief. Meanwhile, Herman (Pierre Bokma) and Liliane (Ariane van Vliet), the latter of whom engages Patrick in joyless sex, are planning to seize control of the camp, taking advantage of Patrick’s weakened state. Yet all Patrick can think about is his hammer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/22/patrick-review-wry-existential-nudist-comedy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>America’s former commander-in-chief shares his character flaws and fears for the presidency in this poetic, introspective account of his childhood and first term in the White House</p><p>Like the best autobiographers, Barack Obama writes about himself in the hope of discovering who or even what he is. It’s a paradoxical project for a man who is universally known and idolised, but this uncertainty or insecurity is his motivating force and his most endearing quality. Born to a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas, brought up in Indonesia and Hawaii, educated in California and New York, he has a plural personality. His mother anglicised his given name by calling him Barry, though he liked to pretend that it was a tribal epithet that identified him as a chieftain. As a candidate for the Senate, he admitted that he was “improbable”; campaigning for the presidency, he revised the adjective to “audacious”. Now, in this searchingly introspective account of his first presidential term, he divests himself of the “power and pomp” of office, disassembles the “ill-fitting parts” that make him up and ponders his similarity to “a platypus or some imaginary beast”, unsure of its dwindling habitat.</p><p>The book, he says, was written by hand, because he mistrusts the smooth gloss of a digital text: he wants to expose “half-baked thoughts”, to scrutinise the first drafts of a person. He mistrusts his own eloquence as an orator, even though it “taps into some collective spirit” and leaves him with a “sugar high”. Hunched at his desk, he has to renounce those winged words and submit to a more reflective self-interrogation. “Is it worth it?”his wife, Michelle, demands as his political ambition upends their placid family life. “When is it going to be enough?” she asks later. Obama, glimpsing himself through her eyes as “this strange guy with a scruffy wardrobe and crazy dreams”, is not sure how to answer. After his election to the Senate, a reporter deferentially inquires: “What do you consider your place in history?”, to which Obama replies with incredulous laughter. Told that he has been awarded the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/09/nobel-peace-prize-barack-obama">Nobel peace prize</a>, he addresses the question more probingly to himself: “For what?” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/22/a-promised-land-by-barack-obama-review-behind-the-power-and-the-pomp">Continue reading...</a>

But Barbey resisted any idea of himself as a war photographer. Just as often, as here, he made his pictures articulate the quieter delight of surreal encounters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/nov/22/the-big-picture-underwater-cycling-with-bruno-barbey-a-boy-plays-in-the-riviere-of-galets-1991-magnum">Continue reading...</a>

## Jan Morris: She sensed she was ‘at the very end of things’. What a life it was …

<p>In her final interview just before the first lockdown, the renowned travel writer spoke cheerfully of her last journey</p><p>Usually, nine months after meeting someone, interviewing them and writing about them for the newspaper, you would expect one or two details of the encounter to stay alive in your mind. But my recollection of the day in late February that I visited Jan Morris at her home in north-west Wales is not like that. Every moment remains vivid.</p><p>Perhaps, you might say, this is because my pre-lockdown journey there – driving through Snowdonia on a wild, windy morning and down to the sea at Criccieth – was just about the only travelling I’ve done all year. But I don’t believe it is that. As anyone knows who ever made that journey to visit her at home, or who ever opened any of her 40 books, Morris dealt in adventure. Having packed her life brim full of extraordinary journeys, pilgrimages and quests, she knew exactly how to conjure their contours for others.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/22/jan-morris-travel-writer-death-adventure-life">Continue reading...</a>

But as the bird rose into the cloudy November sky, I realised it was actually a juvenile swallow, fully two months after I would expect to see one here in Somerset.</p><p>Swallows are the classic spring and summer visitor to our shores; the proverbial sign that winter is over and spring has finally arrived. Having returned here from their homes in Africa in late March or early April, they settle down to raise two or sometimes three broods of young before heading back south in early October.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/22/one-little-straggler-the-swallow-that-didnt-fly-south-for-the-winter">Continue reading...</a>
