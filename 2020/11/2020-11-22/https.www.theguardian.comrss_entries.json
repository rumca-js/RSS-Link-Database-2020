This last one has featured heavily in recent news reports because of the spectacular results of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/18/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-95-effective-and-safe-further-tests-show\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/16/moderna-covid-vaccine-candidate-almost-95-effective-trials-show\">new</a> mRNA vaccines against coronavirus. It stands for \u201cmessenger ribonucleic acid\u201d, a label familiar enough if you studied biology at O-level or GCSE, but otherwise hardly a household name. Even in the field of vaccine research, if you had said as recently as 10 years ago that you could protect people from infections by injecting them with mRNA, you would have provoked some puzzled looks.</p><p>Essentially, mRNA is a molecule used by living cells to turn the gene sequences in DNA into the proteins that are the building blocks of all their fundamental structures. A segment of DNA gets copied (\u201ctranscribed\u201d) into a piece of mRNA, which in turn gets \u201cread\u201d by the cell\u2019s tools for synthesising proteins. In the case of an mRNA vaccine, the virus\u2019s mRNA is injected into the muscle, and our own cells then read it and synthesise the viral protein. The immune system reacts to these proteins \u2013 which can\u2019t by themselves cause disease \u2013 just as if they\u2019d been carried in on the whole virus. This generates a protective response that, we hope, lasts for some time. It\u2019s so beautifully simple it almost seems like science fiction.
