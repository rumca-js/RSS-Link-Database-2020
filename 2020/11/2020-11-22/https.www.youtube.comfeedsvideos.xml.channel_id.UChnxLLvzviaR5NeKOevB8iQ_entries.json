I recorded a bunch of custom wavetables into it from Plaits and the TS-L and then set up the Noodlebox to bridge the clock gap between the rack and the Microcosm. Here are 4 jams showing off some different facets of this setup.\n\n00:00 - Jam 1 (breakbeat)\n10:18 - Jam 2 (chemical beats)\n18:28 - Jam 3 (tech-house)\n28:28 - Jam 4 (spooky downtempo)\n\nhologram microcosm: https://www.hologramelectronics.com/microcosm\n4ms spherical wavetable navigator: https://reverb.grsm.io/4msSWN\nerica synths sample drum: https://reverb.grsm.io/ericasampledrum\ninstruo ts-l: https://reverb.grsm.io/ts-l\ninstruo vinca: https://reverb.grsm.io/vinca\nmake noise rene mk 1: https://reverb.grsm.io/rene1\ntinrs tuesday: https://reverb.grsm.io/tinrstuesday\nmake noise mimeophon: https://reverb.grsm.io/mimeophon\nmake noise tempi: https://reverb.grsm.io/tempi\nintellijel quad vca: https://reverb.grsm.io/intquadvca\nintellijel quadrax: https://reverb.grsm.io/quadrax\nintellijel steppy: https://reverb.grsm.io/steppy3u\nams busy circuits pamelas new workout: https://reverb.grsm.io/pams\ndivkid ochd: https://reverb.grsm.io/ochd\n------------------------------------\nThank you for watching.
