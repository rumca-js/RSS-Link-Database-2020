WAIT, you can use a Raspberry Pi AS A WEBCAM?\n\nIn this video, I'll show you now to set up a Raspberry Pi Zero with the HQ Camera and the 6mm lens as a high-quality webcam to rival the quality of other cameras costing even more (if you can find them this year!).\n\nAnd I'm not going to make you dive into the guts of your Raspberry Pi and compile code or anything like that\u2014it's just one automated job that runs to set everything up for you, on any Raspberry Pi!
