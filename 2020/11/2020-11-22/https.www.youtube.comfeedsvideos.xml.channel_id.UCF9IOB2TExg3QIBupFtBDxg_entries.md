Effect of high dose, oral cholecalciferol supplementation on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance

First cholecalciferol intervention study for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals


Design

Randomised, placebo-controlled.

Participants

Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 

RNA positive vitamin D deficient (25(OH) D less than 20 ng/ml)

Calcifediol, calcidiol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3

Pre intervention baseline serum 25(OH) D

Intervention group, 8.6 ng/ml

Control group, 9.54 ng/ml (p=0.730)

10 out of 16 patients could achieve 25(OH)D more than 50 ng/ml by 
day-7

Another two by day-14

Outcome measure

Proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative before day-21

Change in inflammatory markers

Intervention group (n=16)

60 000 IU of cholecalciferol (oral nano-liquid droplets) for 7 days

Therapeutic target 25(OH)D more than 50 ng/ml

Cholecalciferol supplementation was continued for those with 25(OH)D less than 50 ng/ml

Fibrinogen levels significantly decreased with cholecalciferol supplementation 

10 (62.5%) participants became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative

Control group (n=24)

Placebo

5 (20.8%) participants became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (p less than 0.018)

Both groups

Patients requiring invasive ventilation or with significant comorbidities were excluded

25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7

Regular measurements of: SARS-CoV-2 RNA, fibrinogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin

Improvements

Calcifediol would have been better

Little and often for prevention

Analysis of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Titers of Recovered COVID-19 Patients

https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e02628-20

The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine

Theorized to provide protection against coronavirus disease

To determine whether any MMR IgG titers are inversely correlated with covid severity

Comparing MMR titers to recent COVID-19 severity levels.

The MMR II group

50 subjects who would primarily have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine

Comparison group

30 subjects consisted of those who would primarily have MMR antibodies from sources other than MMR II

Including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses

Results in the MMR group

Significant inverse correlation (rs = −0.71, P less than 0.001) 

Between mumps virus titers and COVID-19 severity

Results in the comparison group

There were no significant correlations between mumps IgG titers and severity in the comparison group

Results in both groups

No correlation between between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group

Scale of the observation

Mumps titers of 134 to 300 arbitrary units (AU)/ml (n = 8), functionally immune or asymptomatic

Less than 134, (n=17) all had mild symptoms

Less than 75, (n=11) all had moderate symptoms

Less than 32, all who had been hospitalized and had required oxygen

Our results demonstrate that there is a significant inverse correlation between mumps titers from MMR II and COVID-19 severity

Four important points

Young children are largely spared from severe disease

Second, numerous countries have COVID-19 death rates that are as low as 1% of the death rates of other countries

Many people, despite prolonged close contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive, never test positive themselves

Nearly half of people who test positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic

Mechanism of action

Sequence homology between both mumps and measles and rubella with SARS-CoV-2

After two doses

97% protected against measles

88% against mumps

97% against rubella
