Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is full of strange history, so we've broken down some of the most interesting periods where the Vikings roamed the lands of Mercia, Wessex and beyond.

Assassin's Creed: Valhalla takes players to England, Norway and even beyond, but while the world is stunningly rendered both on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, there's a lot of secrets hiding within the virtual British Isles where most of the game takes place. 

Even the names of in-game enemies Eivor takes on offer some hints to some peculiar parts of English history, and may potentially link the world to the future DLC, Wrath of the Druids.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, are both in the same franchise, but are two very different shooter experiences. How does Cold War compare to 2019's Modern Warfare, and which one is the better game?

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is the latest game in Activision's first-person shooter series, and it takes the franchise back to the 1980s for a period-set shooter full of espionage thrills. But how does it compare to the previous game in the series, 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare?

In the video above, Dave Jewitt and Richie Bracamonte compare the two games across three topics: multiplayer, campaign, and the battle between the Spec Ops and Zombies modes. From a multiplayer standpoint, Cold War provides a more arcadey Call of Duty experience compared to the Battlefield-inspired action of Modern Warfare.

Dave and Richie also break down the two games' single-player campaigns and discuss the merits of Black Ops Cold War's replayability versus Modern Warfare's rejuvenation of the Call of Duty campaign. And finally, the pair compare the maligned Spec Ops mode from Modern Warfare with Black Ops Cold War's Zombies mode, discussing which of the two modes they prefer.
