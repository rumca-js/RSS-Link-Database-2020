One year ago today — Nov. 11, 2019 — we premiered this recording of mandolin virtuoso Chris Thile performing a live set at the Fine Line in Minneapolis. You'll be blown away by Thile's spellbinding solo performance, and you'll be equally charmed by the audience's reaction. Watching this video will bring back to mind everything you love about seeing live music.

## Ty Segall - solo acoustic set at The Current (2018)

Two years ago this week, singer-songwriter Ty Segall visited our studio to play a solo acoustic session. Watch that three-song set.

Segall's 2018 album, "Freedom's Goblin," is a largely electric guitar and drum-driven effort … which raises the question why Segall embarked on a solo acoustic tour the same year of its release. "It's really scary and really challenging," Segall explained. "I'm kind of obsessed with trying to do stuff that either I shouldn't do or that's hard for me or that's frightening or just super fun."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Alta"
3:47 "Crazy"
6:11 "My Lady's On Fire"
