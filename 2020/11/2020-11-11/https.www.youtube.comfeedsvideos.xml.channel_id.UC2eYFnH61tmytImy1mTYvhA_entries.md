I'm about to put down a lot of money to finally getting good internet out here. I'm going to get a 4G LTE router to turn cell reception into internet usable at my house. The issue is I don't have cell reception either...

The three things I'm going to get are:
1) A Verizon unlimited and unmetered plan
2) A 4G LTE router that works with the Verizon system and has coaxial cable inputs
3) An antenna system that can connect to the router to get distant connections. The closest cell tower is a little under 10 miles away.

The issue is that I'm not sure how to get the *best* deals and best products for each of these purposes so I'm asking for help. I hope to buy what I need by the end of the week or maybe next week at the latest.

People have suggested the Mofi router and getting a parabolic grid or directional MIMO/Yagi antennas. If anyone has had experience please share them. I'll also need some Verizon plan, so if anyone knows where I can get an old grandfathered plan, feel free to tell me.

I'll be putting up videos of getting all of this stuff working.

## PASS: a Password Manager & Two Factor Authentication (OTP) with no Cell Phone

Usually I just remember my passwords, but the program pass is very nice for storing many passwords, calling them in scripts, inserting them from a dmenu prompt and more. Crucially, with the pass-otp module, it can also do Two Factor Authentication (2FA/TFA) AKA One Time Passwords (OTP) where you use a 6-digit-password that changes every half a minute or so. Usually, normies use a cell phone for this, but you can actually just have pass do it on your computer. I actually have a dmenu prompt that gives me a list of all my OTPs to insert, and it automatically generates the six-digit password.
Pass will be in your distro's package repository, but here's the site.
https://www.passwordstore.org/
pass-otp is probably also in your repository, but here is the Github:
https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp
Note that I also use the program zbarimg to convert a QR code into text that we can feed into pass-otp. It will be in your distro's package repo too.

Pass uses GPG to encrypt and decrypt your passwords, so I also talk about making a GPG key pair. You can have your GPG unlock automatically on login with pam-gnupg:
