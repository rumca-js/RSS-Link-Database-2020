after randomization\n\nAssessed with a 7-category ordinal scale\n\nRanging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged able to do normal duties)\n\n1, death\n\n2, hospitalized, receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or invasive mechanical ventilation\n\n3, hospitalized, receiving noninvasive mechanical ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen therapy\n\n4, hospitalized, receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure or high flow\n\n5, hospitalized, not receiving supplemental oxygen\n\n6, not hospitalized and unable to perform normal activities\n\n7, not hospitalized and able to perform normal activities\n\nAlso 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality.\n\nParticipants\n\nFemale, 44.3%\n\nHispanic/Latinx, 23.4%\n\nBlack, 20.1%\n\nReceiving supplemental oxygen, 46.8%\n\nOxygen with pressure,11.5%\n\nInvasive mechanical ventilation, 6.7%\n\nMedian duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days\n\nResult\n\nClinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups\n\naOR, 1.02\n\nNone of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups\n\nAt 28 days

hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19\n\nHydroxychloroquine, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14 or reduce deaths at 28 days\n\nThese findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n16W3cjBttA", "date_published": "2020-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false,
