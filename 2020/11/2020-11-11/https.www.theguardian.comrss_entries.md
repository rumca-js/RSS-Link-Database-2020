## ‘My son’s studies inspired me to do a law degree – 14 years later he admitted me into the supreme court’

<p> Someone said to me: ‘Do you really think you can do a law degree? It’s hard.’ I said: ‘Being a single mother and raising four children by myself is hard’</p><p>I never considered leaving my home town, or going to university, when I was growing up. I thought that I would live in Mount Isa all my life, and find a job there in one of the shops. No one I knew at that time lived outside of Mount Isa.</p><p>I am Wannyi/Kalkadoon, and I was born prematurely as my mother had cancer. Sadly, she passed six months later. My sister said I was small, but a fighter. I was the youngest of 12 children. Growing up, my father eventually had to go back out to the stations to work as a cook, while my elder sisters and my mother’s family helped look after us.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/12/my-sons-studies-inspired-me-to-do-a-law-degree-14-years-later-he-admitted-me-into-the-supreme-court">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I’d just been to a Giacometti show and was feeling inspired. I went out on to Tate Modern’s balcony – and everything aligned’</p><p>It is often said that the hardest place for a street photographer to shoot is the place they are from. I’ve lived in London my whole life and fortunately haven’t found that to be true. The city is a bit of a blessing for a photographer like me, as there is so much to play with: iconic backdrops, architecture from many different centuries, a wide variety of cultures and demographics, four distinct seasons and generally nice light.</p><p>I titled this shot The Four Giacomettis. I had just been to an exhibition of the Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti’s work at Tate Modern and was feeling quite inspired. I went out on to Tate Modern’s balcony and set about trying to make use of the reflections made possible by the wet asphalt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/nov/11/real-life-giacomettis-riverside-rainy-stroll-alan-schallers-best-photograph">Continue reading...</a>

I worry also that the Democratic party, as currently led by Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, will dive further rightwards in an attempt to appeal to the rightwing elements of this country, a move that will assuredly lead to fewer Democratic senators and members of Congress as well as a weakening of the current drive for broader progressive policies such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for all.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/11/guardian-readers-us-election-result-biden-trump">Guardian readers on the election result: 'The hopes of a nation rest in good hands'</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/nov/11/us-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-kamala-harris-transition-supreme-court-obamacare-coronavirus-covid-live-updates">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The HBO/BBC show overplays the excesses but gets a lot spot on, from the expensive dinners to the often cruel ‘banter’<br /></p><p>During my first weeks on a graduate program in investment banking, I spent most of my days unattended on the desk, praying for the phone not to ring. After yet another day of avoiding doing anything in particular, I began to fear that sitting silently might also not be the best way to impress on the trading floor jungle. After stewing and deliberating for some time, I walked past my boss’s empty desk to Amin’s – the next one along – and dispatched my best banal 5pm small talk. The reply? A slow turn around and a “Fuck off”.</p><p>Given these friendly beginnings, plenty of the BBC’s new drama Industry, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/10/industry-review-lena-dunham-directs-taut-drama-you-can-bank-on">about a group of young bankers on a graduate scheme</a>, rang true. The joy of spending all of your £30 dinner allowance and sneaking some food home. The “banter” (“Did you bring the Evening Standard?” would ring out if you arrived at the office at 7.01am instead of 7am). Interviews where you have to say you like meritocracy not money. The trading desk thinking the sales team just answer the phone. Sales thinking traders are animals that can’t talk to clients. Researchers thinking both don’t know anything at all. Dinners at £150 a head expensed without a blink of an eye. Clients that don’t want to talk about business over lunch for fear of spoiling a nice time. And, just as happens to one of the show’s characters, someone really did tear off my shirt pocket – two days in a row – saying it looked like I was there to fix the lights. I quickly beat the well-worn path to TM Lewin for the city uniform.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/11/if-cocaines-everywhere-i-missed-the-memo-industry-as-seen-by-a-banker">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Novelist Naji Bakhti chooses fiction, history and memoir to tell stories of a country that has weathered decades of upheaval<br /></p><p>Many years ago, a well-meaning American friend introduced me to his favourite student pastime: a drinking game. I had just moved to London and it was my first time living outside Beirut. “It’s called Beirut,” said my friend as he illustrated the mechanism through which a ping-pong ball would land in a pint of beer. The reason for the name, he explained, was the thumping sound the ball makes as it splashes against the lager. It was enough to make me homesick and mildly offended in equal measure.</p><p>Which is to say that Beirut, and indeed Lebanon, can be difficult to separate from the years of civil strife that so defined it for a decade and a half. Elias Khoury, Hoda Barakat, Rawi Hage, Hanan al-Shaykh and Rabih Alameddine are just some of many Lebanese authors whose work tended to be preoccupied with the civil war. My own novel, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/between-beirut-and-the-moon-9781910312551.html">Between Beirut and the Moon</a>, is no different in that regard. Although outside literature, in contrast, the Lebanese have been guilty of attempting to bury the past too swiftly. But enough about the war. Here is a list of books about Lebanon which do not immediately concern themselves with the civil war, except when they do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/11/top-10-books-about-lebanon">Continue reading...</a>

This might sound like a straightforward question, but take a moment to think about what it’s actually asking. Are we interested in how many people will catch the virus from those currently infected?

<p>How giving up a secure corporate job to become a primary school teacher proved to be a rewarding choice later in life</p><p>For many people, the thought of a career change remains just that – a fleeting thought. But for Philip, it became an all-consuming idea he couldn’t forget.</p><p>He had a well-paid corporate job with a major energy company, where he’d worked for 14 years, and on the surface everything looked great. “But it didn’t offer me any sort of satisfaction at all,” he says. “Then I had my own children and they started to learn to read, and that feeling, when your children start to learn things, is a great feeling.

<p>Pantomime misanthropy is tempered with bursts of sweetness in the secondhand bookseller’s latest dispatches from Wigtown</p><p>There’s a moment in the first season of the short-lived but influential sitcom <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/13/dylan-moran-dr-cosmos-britain-brexit">Black Books</a> </em>in which an elderly customer appears with a box of attractive old editions of classics to sell to Dylan Moran’s crosspatch bookseller Bernard. Barely looking at them, Bernard offers him £40. But they’re worth more than that, the man says. “I know, I know,” Bernard concedes. “But I don’t <em>want </em>them. I’ll have to price them, then, and put them up on the shelves, and store them, and people will come in and ask about them, and buy them, and read them, and come back and sell them and the whole hideous cycle will just go on and on and on ...” He gives the man £40 to take the books away.</p><p>Shaun Bythell’s dispatches from the Wigtown Bookshop, which he has run for nearly 20 years, read like a knowing riff on the persona of Bernard Black. He started out grousing about his life, pillorying his eccentric staff and venting about his noisome customers on a Facebook page. Then he did the same in his hit<em> Diary of a Bookseller, </em>continued with <em>Confessions of a Bookseller, </em>and here he is – an actual franchise – with a slim little listicle-titled till-point follow-up for the Christmas market. His inner Bernard Black will be heaving a world-weary sigh. The more he parades his <em>contemptus mundi</em>, the more the world loves him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/11/seven-kinds-of-people-you-find-in-bookshops-by-shaun-bythell-review-virtuosic-venting">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Women the world over kicked back against his sexist, machismo movement. But the fight is not over </p><p>The day before the US elections, a <a href="https://twitter.com/LiquidFaerie/status/1323358625327419397">photograph of a Polish protester</a> waving a rainbow flag went viral. She’s wearing a mask and dressed all in black; in the background, a group of men light smoke bombs and she stands, confidently, in front of billowing clouds of smoke. It’s a striking image and, as Polish women and their allies fight for their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/03/poland-stalls-abortion-ban-amid-nationwide-protests">reproductive freedom</a>, it gave me hope. To then finally hear, after days of tension, that the misogynist Donald Trump had been voted out of office felt as though a stone had been lifted from my chest.</p><p>Global feminism is like a tangle of cables, intertwined in complex knots. Those cables bind us to one another, transmitting our struggles in fractions of seconds. I have female friends who are Polish and Irish and American, and how they are treated by their home countries matters to me. But my solidarity stretches further than that, and is underpinned by a sort of simmering anger. I cried for American women when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/18/ruth-bader-ginsburg-supreme-court-justice-dies-aged-87">Ruth Bader Ginsburg died</a>, and I applauded with joy for Irish women (and later, thank God, for Northern Irish women too) when <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2018/may/26/irish-abortion-referendum-result-count-begins-live">abortion was legalised</a> there.

<p>She went platinum by plugging Bach into 20th-century machines, and was soon working with Stanley Kubrick. But prejudice around her gender transition pushed Wendy Carlos out of sight</p><p>This summer, an 80-year-old synthesiser pioneer suddenly appeared online. She had been silent for 11 years, but now something had appeared that she just wouldn’t tolerate. “Please be aware there’s a purported ‘biography’ on me just released,” wrote Wendy Carlos on <a href="http://www.wendycarlos.com/">the homepage of her 16-bit-friendly website</a>, a Siamese cat and a synthesiser behind her portrait. “No one ever interviewed me [for it], nor anyone I know,” she went on. “Aren’t there new, more interesting targets?”</p><p>Given that Carlos is arguably the most important living figure in the history of electronic music, it’s remarkable that <a href="https://www.foyles.co.uk/witem/biography/wendy-carlos-a-biography,amanda-sewell-9780190053468">Amanda Sewell’s Wendy Carlos: A Biography</a> is the first book about her. This is the musician who pushed Robert Moog to perfect his first analogue synthesiser, from which pop, prog, electronica and film music flourished. Her smash-hit 1968 album <a href="https://www.electronicbeats.net/the-feed/listen-to-the-60s-modular-synth-record-that-changed-everything-it-turns-50-this-month/">Switched-On Bach</a> made the Moog internationally famous and became the second classical album ever to go platinum in the US. Then came her extraordinary soundtracks for A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Tron. She made an ambient album five years before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/brianeno">Brian Eno</a> did, and jumped from analogue machines to do leading work in digital synthesis, but worried that her status as one of the first visible transgender artists in the US would overshadow it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/11/she-made-music-jump-into-3d-wendy-carlos-the-reclusive-synth-genius">Continue reading...</a>

## Is this the death of Fox News's love affair with Donald Trump? | Arwa Mahdawi

<p>Since his election loss, the rightwing network has distanced itself from Donald Trump. Where will the Maga brigade get their news now? </p><p>Poor Donald Trump. Not only has he lost the election, it looks as if he has lost the love of his life. I’m not talking about Melania – although some rumours have it that she is “<a href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/melania-trump-counting-minutes-divorce-election-loss-aides-claim-041846538.html">counting the minutes</a>” until she can get a divorce (which <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/melania-trump-accuses-husbands-ex-22981717">she has denied</a>). I’m talking about Fox News.</p><p>For years, Trump and Fox News have been in a committed, loving relationship. Recently, however, there has been trouble in paradise, with Trump <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-attacks-fox-news-during-035505880.html">complaining</a> the network is a “much different place than it used to be”. The relationship might have been salvaged, but then Fox News did something unforgivable: it flirted with real journalism. On election day, it was the first major outlet to declare Joe Biden would win Arizona, sending the Trump administration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/05/fox-draws-trump-campaigns-ire-after-early-call-of-arizona-for-biden">into a meltdown</a>. Since then, Fox News has continued to infuriate the White House by refusing to encourage Trump’s delusion that he won the election. On Monday, for example, it <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/10/whoa-fox-news-cuts-off-kayleigh-mcenany-for-votes-spiel">cut away from the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany</a>, when she claimed that the Democrats had encouraged voter fraud. “Whoa, whoa, whoa,” the Fox News anchor said to the viewers. “I can’t in good countenance continue showing you this.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/11/is-this-the-death-of-fox-newss-love-affair-with-donald-trump">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At the age of seven, she flew to Birmingham from Antigua on her own – and became the first globally successful British female singer-songwriter. As she wins the award she once gave to Margaret Thatcher, Joan Armatrading<strong> </strong>looks back<br /></p><p>‘It’s very nice to be honoured,” says Joan Armatrading, down the phone from her home in Surrey. The 69-year-old is talking about receiving this year’s <a href="http://www.womenoftheyear.co.uk/">Women of the Year</a> lifetime achievement award, which sees her honoured alongside the likes of child burns survivor Sylvia Mac and Adwoa Dickson, who set up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/17/were-bonded-like-sisters-the-choir-giving-trafficked-women-a-voice-amies-freedom-choir">a community choir for young women who survived trafficking</a>. “Whether I measure up is another question.”</p><p>She’s joking, of course, but what does the continued existence of the award tell us about where the struggle for equality is in 2020? “It’s maybe not as relevant as it was in 1955,” she says, “when Tony Lothian set it up after being denied admission to a men-only meeting. But women are still doing incredible things in this society, so reward them.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/11/joan-armatrading-woman-of-the-year-heavy-metal-album-guitar-shredding-margaret-thatcher">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The coronavirus pandemic has left us living more and more of our lives online. But the place where we chat with friends, get our news and form our opinions is full of vile and dangerous conspiracy theories. Is the world’s biggest social network doing enough to combat them?<br /></p><p>As with many others in Britain, lockdown hit Rachel and her husband, Philip, hard. Almost overnight, the couple, both in their early 50s, found themselves cut off from friends, family and colleagues. Before the Covid-19 outbreak, they had both been working every day; now Philip found himself furloughed, while Rachel was put on rotation with other essential staff, working fewer shifts at odd hours. They were unable to meet up with their four adult sons and daughters. They had to attend a family funeral while remaining socially distanced.</p><p>Initially, Rachel coped in the way many others did. She played more video games than normal, and felt stressed at work, but as far as possible she managed. Her husband didn’t. For him, it seemed there must be more to it than the authorities struggling to cope with a novel virus and evolving expert advice. “The regularly changing and conflicting information that was coming from the government added to the feeling in him that they were making things up or covering something up,” Rachel says now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/11/how-2020-transformed-big-tech-the-story-of-facebook-qanon-and-the-worlds-slackening-grip-on-reality">Continue reading...</a>
