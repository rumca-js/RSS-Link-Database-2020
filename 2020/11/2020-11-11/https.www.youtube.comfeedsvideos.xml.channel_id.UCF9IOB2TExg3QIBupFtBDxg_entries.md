Community Use of Cloth Masks

Cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe

Non-valved multi-layer cloth masks

Asymptomatic or presymptomatic, more than 50% of transmissions

Masks also help reduce inhalation of these droplets by the wearer

Filtration for personal protection

Filtration and blockage of droplets (80%)

Filtration for Personal Protection

Reduce wearers’ exposure to infectious droplets

Including fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns

Multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts

Filtering nearly 50% of fine particles less than 1 micron

Human Studies of Masking and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission

Two symptomatically ill hair stylists

15 minutes

139 clients

8-day period

67 clients consented to an interview

Infections, none

Stylists and all clients universally wore mask

Thailand 

1,000 people

Always worn a mask during high-risk exposures, 70% reduced risk of infection

Theodore Roosevelt

70% reduced risk

In-flight transmissions

Community level studies

Germany, Arizona, other states and hospitals

Following directives from leadership for universal masking

New infections fell significantly

200 countries, including US demonstrated reductions in mortality

U.S. data

Increase masking by 15% = no lockdown and reduce associated losses of up to $1 trillion

Conclusions

Source control and personal protection is likely complementary and possibly synergistic

Gov. Kim Reynolds, Iowa

Mask requirements for large public gatherings

Requires masks for indoor gatherings of more than 25 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people

Iowa is open for business, and we intend to keep it that way

That’s why it’s time for these additional mitigation measures

Health care system at risk of reaching capacity

200 % increase in past 2 weeks

Texas prisons

Cases, 41,000

Deaths, 187

HK has barred all non-residents since March
Passengers must test negative and use designated flights

Background

Hydroxychloroquine has been widely promoted as a potential therapy

Anti-inflammatory, reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines

Antiviral activity

Ionophore for zinc

Invitro reduced viral entry into cells

Adopted into routine care for hospitalized adults with COVID-19

Effect of Hydroxychloroquine on Clinical Status at 14 Days in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19

JAMA, 9th November

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2772922?guestAccessKey=39a5ea0f-7853-478d-9f94-6e83c06cc89b&utm_source=silverchair&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=article_alert-jama&utm_content=olf&utm_term=110920

Multicenter, blinded, placebo-controlled randomized trial

Conducted at 34 hospitals in the US

Adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms

Severe acute respiratory syndrome

April 2 and June 19, 2020

Trial was stopped at the fourth interim analysis for futility with a sample size of 479 patients

Interventions group, n = 242

Hydroxychloroquine

400 mg twice daily for 2 doses

then 200 mg twice daily for 8 doses

A total of 10 doses over 5 days

Placebo group n = 237

Given placebo meds

Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was clinical status 14 days after randomization

Assessed with a 7-category ordinal scale

Ranging from 1 (death) to 7 (discharged able to do normal duties)

1, death

2, hospitalized, receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or invasive mechanical ventilation

3, hospitalized, receiving noninvasive mechanical ventilation or nasal high-flow oxygen therapy

4, hospitalized, receiving supplemental oxygen without positive pressure or high flow

5, hospitalized, not receiving supplemental oxygen

6, not hospitalized and unable to perform normal activities

7, not hospitalized and able to perform normal activities

Also 12 secondary outcomes, including 28-day mortality.

Participants

Female, 44.3%

Hispanic/Latinx, 23.4%

Black, 20.1%

Receiving supplemental oxygen, 46.8%

Oxygen with pressure,11.5%

Invasive mechanical ventilation, 6.7%

Median duration of symptoms prior to randomization was 5 days

Result

Clinical status on the ordinal outcome scale at 14 days did not significantly differ between the hydroxychloroquine and placebo groups

aOR, 1.02

None of the 12 secondary outcomes were significantly different between groups

At 28 days after randomization

Hydroxychloroquine group

25 of 241 patients (10.4%) had died

Placebo group

25 of 236 (10.6%) had died

aOR, 1.07

Conclusions and Relevance

Among adults hospitalized with respiratory illness from COVID-19

Hydroxychloroquine, did not significantly improve clinical status at day 14 or reduce deaths at 28 days

These findings do not support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 among hospitalized adults.
