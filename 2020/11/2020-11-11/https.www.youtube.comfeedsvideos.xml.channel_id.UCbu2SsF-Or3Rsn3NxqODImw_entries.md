The Call of Duty Black Ops games have had twisting narratives that can be tricky to follow. Ahead of the launch of Cold War, we’re here to catch you up on the central plots and the journeys of characters like Woods, Mason, and Hudson.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes place between the original Black Ops 1 and its sequel, Black Ops II--releasing in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Given that it's been a while, we feel a refresher on the Black Ops characters and plot points is in order.

In the video above, we go over where we left off with central characters like Alex Mason, Frank Woods, and Jason Hudson, as well as which villains are still alive and what story cliffhangers are worth keeping in mind. If you haven't played the first Black Ops, the game involves a lot of twisting plot points, including an attempt to assassinate Fidel Castro, a brainwashing program that has to do with mysterious numbers, chemical weapons, and betrayals. 

Black Ops Cold War picks up 13 years after Black Ops with Russian spy Perseus infiltrating the United States nuclear weapons program. A new cast of operatives--Russell Adler and Lawrence Sims from the CIA, Eleazar from Mossad, and Helen Park from MI6--are trying to stop Perseus. The campaign bounces back and forth between the present day (1980s Europe) and flashbacks to the past, which take place in Vietnam. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

In this latest comparison, we take a look at how the brand-new Demon's Souls remake on PlayStation 5 stacks up against the original game on the PlayStation 3. Check out the similarities and the differences some 11 years later.

Developer Bluepoint Studios' remake of Demon's Souls is finally here, releasing for PlayStation 5. The remake launches about 11 years after the original Demon's Souls, developed by From Software for PlayStation 3. Don't know about y'all, but we think that a comparison is in order.

In the video above, we play through Demon's Souls on PS3 and Demon's Souls remake on PS5. When seen side-by-side, the differences of when the two games were made, and the changes brought about by 11 years of technological progress, are fairly obvious. However, you can also see how similar the two games are as well--the remake may give Demon's Souls a fresh coat of paint but it's still the same hard-as-hell game with a terrifying atmosphere that From Software released back in 2009. 

Demon's Souls is the comparatively niche older brother to the rest of From Software's Soulsborne games, which include Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls III. Though it's not as popular as these games, Demon's Souls is pretty much the start of what would later be called the soulslike genre--even if the genre's popularity and acceptance into the mainstream is more directly connected to Dark Souls.

Demon's Souls releases as an exclusive launch title for PlayStation 5.

This mission shows off what Cold War can do on a PlayStation 5 by taking players on an aerial hunt to find Perseus during the Vietnam War.  

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has a number of flashback missions. In this 4K gameplay, players head to Vietnam to take part in a helicopter assault on an enemy village. We get to meet younger versions of some of the game's main characters, including CIA officers Russell Adler and Lawrence Sims as they discover the Russian superspy Perseus.  

When looking at how Cold War looks on PS5, this level has a wide range of terrain, including a muddy American base, the jungle from the air, rivers, and town. This level also shows air-to-ground transitions. On PlayStation 5, Call of Duty enhancements can include 4K, high dynamic range, and ray-tracing.  

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

## PS5 Demon's Soul's Remake: Classic Camera and Filter 4k Gameplay

The new PS5 remake of Demon's Souls makes a variety of adjustments to the From Software game to modernize it, but you can also opt to play with a classic camera and filter to make it more closely resemble the original version.

The new PS5 remake of Demon's Souls sets out to recreate the original game with various modern touches while still delivering the same core experience. Among other things, the look and camera have both been updated, but if you prefer a look that more closely resembles the original From Software version of the game, you're in luck.

Developer Bluepoint Games has included both a classic filter and camera angle option, which does away with the more modern-style camera that's enabled by default in the remake. That way, you can see what feels best for you. The classic filter will also deliver a visual style more in line with the PS3 game, while there are other options on that front, including a black-and-white mode.

Demon's Souls releases alongside the PlayStation 5 on November 12. It's among the first wave of next-gen games with an increased price tag, selling for $70 in the US.

We load in from the Nexus into the Gates of Boletaria. Get a glimpse of 15 minutes of Demon's Souls on the PlayStation 5. 

In this clip from an early section of the Demon's Souls remake, we head through the Gates of Boletaria to see what Bluepoint's game has to offer. You'll see us fight against dangerous soldiers, avoid traps, and guard our precious souls as we attempt to move forward without getting killed. The game is running in performance mode at 60 frames per second on the PS5.
This version of Demon's Souls is a PS5 exclusive, having originally released more than a decade ago exclusively for PS3. The game's structure and enemies remain unchanged, but its visuals were rebuilt from the ground up to take full advantage of the PS5's hardware. It releases alongside the system on November 12.

## PS4 Pro vs PS5: Days Gone

Want to know how much of a difference a PS5's optimization patch adds to your PS4 games? Check out this comparison of Days Gone, running on PS4 Pro and PS5 with the latest patches.

With the release of the PlayStation 5, certain PS4 games will be getting a boost, so we’re playing through several PS4 games on PS5 to see how Sony’s next-gen console improves the performance or experience of current-gen games. 
In the video above, we show off Days Gone. We first played the game on PS4 Pro and then played it on PS5—in both instances, focusing on the first 30 minutes of the campaign. As you can see, Days Gone plays at a much smother frame rate on PS5, which is especially noticeable when zooming through its zombie-infested world while on motorcycle.  
There are other, less noticeable differences as well. For instance, Days Gone features less pop-in textures on PS5, and the game loads a whole lot faster on next-gen, too. If you’re thinking about picking up Days Gone, it appears you’ll have a much smoother experience on PS5 in comparison to PS4. 
In GameSpot’s Days Gone review, Kallie Plagge writes, “I did a lot of things in Days Gone. I burned every single Freaker nest; I cleared every ambush camp; I maxed out my bike; I took out a few optional hordes just because. Like Deacon with Sarah, I kept going because I hoped to find something, to follow a thread to a possibly fascinating or satisfying or impactful conclusion. But at the end of it all, I'd only gotten scraps.”

## PS5 Spider-Man Remastered vs PS4 Pro

Take a look at Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered running on PS5 in Fidelity Mode compared to Marvel's Spider-Man (2018) running on a PlayStation 4 Pro. 

One of the PlayStation 4's most beloved games, Marvel's Spider-Man has received a face lift (quite literally) for Sony's brand-new PlayStation 5, so we compared it to a version of the game running on PlayStation 4 Pro.

Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered for PlayStation 5 is able to be played in two modes. In Performance Mode, the game runs at 60fps, but doesn't have all the bells and whistles afforded to the next generation, such as ray tracing. In Fidelity Mode, the game is locked at 30fps, but has lighting enhancements, ray tracing, and additional visual effects. We compared the PS5 version's Fidelity Mode to the PlayStation 4 Pro version of the game, which runs at 30fps in an upscaled 4K resolution. 

We also show some more footage of Peter Parker's new face, so you can compare it to the old one, and judge which you prefer. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales' Ultimate Edition includes Spider-Man Remastered. You can buy the game separately, or upgrade your PS4 version.

At this point, you know how the story goes. The Xbox One had a tumultuous launch and presented itself as something other than what its fans wanted. However, fast-forward to today and, as a brand, Xbox is the healthiest it has been in many years. This it thanks to a realigning of strategies that places people that play video games at the center and, at the same time, moves Xbox in bold new directions.

Under the leadership of Phil Spencer, Xbox has pioneered Game Pass, a Netflix-like subscription service that offers a large library of games for a relatively low subscription fee. It has expanded this service to PC, and also launched a cloud gaming service in xCloud.
Furthermore, the platform holder took big step to improve accessibility, and made meaningful changes to the Xbox One experience to improve it for Xbox One X. This, altogether, has allowed Xbox to turn a stumble into a steady jog towards success
Ahead of the launch of the Xbox Series X and Series S, we spoke to Spencer about the identity of Xbox, the state of Halo, and the future of Xbox as he sees it.

Let’s help you break down price, performance, and other key differences to consider when buying a next-gen Xbox console.

Microsoft's Xbox Series S and Series X are shaping up to be promising next-gen game consoles. If you’re looking at buying one there are big differences to consider. In this video we take a look at what you’re getting for the price either buying outright or through Game Pass Ultimate. We’re going to look at how backwards compatible games can be loaded onto each console, differences in performance and power, physical size, hard drive space, and clever ways the S is trying to compete with the X. Both consoles can be bought outright or paid off over two years with Game Pass Ultimate that includes a rotating list of titles, EA Play, more upcoming games will be added such as Halo Infinite and Bethesda's lineup. 

The Series X comes with the most power, 4k native resolution, a 1 TB NVMe Solid State Drive, and a disc drive. The Series S upscales from 1440p to 4k, has a 512 GB hard drive, and aims to make game sizes around 30% smaller on average. The Series S is also 60% physically smaller. 

Xbox consoles release on November 10th with waves of pre-orders becoming available. GameSpot has an Xbox Series X and are currently running it through its paces. Head over to GameSpot to see our preview, new faster load times, and how 4k footage looks.
