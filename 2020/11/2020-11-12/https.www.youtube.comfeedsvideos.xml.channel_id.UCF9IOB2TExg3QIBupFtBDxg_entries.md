Primary care data

Sufficient statistical power

Associations with specific medications and medical conditions

Early during the pandemic

Save lives by modifying patient, clinician, and population behaviour

Effect of pre-exposure use of hydroxychloroquine on COVID-19 mortality: a population-based cohort study in patients with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus using the OpenSAFELY platform 

Lancet, 5th November, MRC

https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanrhe/article/PIIS2665-9913(20)30378-7/fulltext

Hydroxychloroquine

Pre¬exposure (as opposed to post¬exposure) prophylactic 

Inhibit entry of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) into epithelial cells in vitro

No evidence of reduced mortality when treating patients with COVID-19

Methods

Observational

Population-based cohort study

Approximately 40% of the general population in England

Association between ongoing use before COVID-19

Compared with non-users of hydroxychloroquine

Risk of COVID-19 mortality

People with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus

n = 194, 637 with rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus

n = 30, 569 received two or more prescriptions of hydroxychloroquine

March 1 and July 13, 2020

547 deaths

Users (n= 30,569)

70 deaths

IFR = 0.23%

Non – users (n = 164,068)

IFR = 0.22%

An absolute difference of 0·008%
Accounting for age, sex, ethnicity, use of other immunosuppressive drugs, and geographical 
region
No association with COVID-19 mortality was observed

Community Use of Cloth Masks

Cough, sneeze, sing, talk, or breathe

Non-valved multi-layer cloth masks

Asymptomatic or presymptomatic, more than 50% of transmissions

Masks also help reduce inhalation of these droplets by the wearer

Filtration for personal protection

Filtration and blockage of droplets (80%)

Filtration for Personal Protection

Reduce wearers’ exposure to infectious droplets

Including fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns

Multiple layers of cloth with higher thread counts

Filtering nearly 50% of fine particles less than 1 micron

Human Studies of Masking and SARS-CoV-2 Transmission

Two symptomatically ill hair stylists

15 minutes

139 clients

8-day period

67 clients consented to an interview

Infections, none

Stylists and all clients universally wore mask

Thailand 

1,000 people

Always worn a mask during high-risk exposures, 70% reduced risk of infection

Theodore Roosevelt

70% reduced risk

In-flight transmissions

Community level studies

Germany, Arizona, other states and hospitals

Following directives from leadership for universal masking

New infections fell significantly

200 countries, including US demonstrated reductions in mortality

U.S. data

Increase masking by 15% = no lockdown and reduce associated losses of up to $1 trillion

Conclusions

Source control and personal protection is likely complementary and possibly synergistic

Gov. Kim Reynolds, Iowa

Mask requirements for large public gatherings

Requires masks for indoor gatherings of more than 25 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people

Iowa is open for business, and we intend to keep it that way

That’s why it’s time for these additional mitigation measures

Health care system at risk of reaching capacity

200 % increase in past 2 weeks

Texas prisons

Cases, 41,000

Deaths, 187

Florida, Michigan, Ohio, New Jersey
