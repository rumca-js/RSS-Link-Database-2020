It’s PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launch week! To celebrate, Tam interviews Xbox boss Phil Spencer, and shares his early impressions of Demon’s Souls. Keep gamin’! 

It’s PS5 and Xbox Series X/S launch week, and to celebrate, the Generation Next team have a bumper launch special for you to feast your eyes on. 

First up, Tamoor interviewed Xbox boss Phil Spencer, so we show some choice cuts from the discussion, including what Halo Infinite’s delay has meant to Xbox, a lack of first-party showpiece games for the Xbox Series X/S, the platform's presence in the Asian market, and, of course, some Elden Ring chat. We also finally ask Phil what he thinks of the nicknames Big Phil and Phil Sponsors, and he picks his favourite.

But that’s not all! We finally get to spend some time with Bluepoint Games’ Demon’s Souls remake, and Tam shares his early review impressions (spoilers, they’re very positive). Generation Next isn’t going anywhere now that the consoles are out, so keep a look out for it next Friday, and if you’re getting a new console this weekend, enjoy!

We compare the two next-gen versions of Assassin's Creed Valhalla, taking a look at the game's load times, and visuals on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. 

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is available now for both current and next-gen platforms. We already compared the game's Xbox One X version to its Series X upgrade, with the Series X version having clear improvements over last gen, but what differences can we expect between Series X and Sony's new PlayStation 5?

In the video above, we take the same Assassin's Creed Valhalla save file and, thanks to the cloud, use it on both platforms, to compare as fairly as possible. We also used the same capture device and in-game settings. We compare the fast travel load times between Norway and England, and take a look at how the visuals and performance differ between the platforms. You'll see that the differences are negligible, but a keen eye may be able to spot them.

Take a look at the video to discern the key differences between the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game. If you currently own Assassin's Creed Valhalla on PS4 or Xbox One,, the game upgrades to the next gen version for free when you get a new console, and you can use your cloud save to pick up where you left off.

## Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War Campaign Timeline

The Call of Duty Black Ops games have had twisting narratives that can be tricky to follow. Ahead of the launch of Cold War, we’re here to catch you up on the central plots and the journeys of characters like Woods, Mason, and Hudson.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes place between the original Black Ops 1 and its sequel, Black Ops II--releasing in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Given that it's been a while, we feel a refresher on the Black Ops characters and plot points is in order.

In the video above, we go over where we left off with central characters like Alex Mason, Frank Woods, and Jason Hudson, as well as which villains are still alive and what story cliffhangers are worth keeping in mind. If you haven't played the first Black Ops, the game involves a lot of twisting plot points, including an attempt to assassinate Fidel Castro, a brainwashing program that has to do with mysterious numbers, chemical weapons, and betrayals. 

Black Ops Cold War picks up 13 years after Black Ops with Russian spy Perseus infiltrating the United States nuclear weapons program. A new cast of operatives--Russell Adler and Lawrence Sims from the CIA, Eleazar from Mossad, and Helen Park from MI6--are trying to stop Perseus. The campaign bounces back and forth between the present day (1980s Europe) and flashbacks to the past, which take place in Vietnam. 

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

## Demon's Souls PS5 Remake vs PS3 Original

In this latest comparison, we take a look at how the brand-new Demon's Souls remake on PlayStation 5 stacks up against the original game on the PlayStation 3. Check out the similarities and the differences some 11 years later.

Developer Bluepoint Studios' remake of Demon's Souls is finally here, releasing for PlayStation 5. The remake launches about 11 years after the original Demon's Souls, developed by From Software for PlayStation 3. Don't know about y'all, but we think that a comparison is in order.

In the video above, we play through Demon's Souls on PS3 and Demon's Souls remake on PS5. When seen side-by-side, the differences of when the two games were made, and the changes brought about by 11 years of technological progress, are fairly obvious. However, you can also see how similar the two games are as well--the remake may give Demon's Souls a fresh coat of paint but it's still the same hard-as-hell game with a terrifying atmosphere that From Software released back in 2009. 

Demon's Souls is the comparatively niche older brother to the rest of From Software's Soulsborne games, which include Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls III. Though it's not as popular as these games, Demon's Souls is pretty much the start of what would later be called the soulslike genre--even if the genre's popularity and acceptance into the mainstream is more directly connected to Dark Souls.

Demon's Souls releases as an exclusive launch title for PlayStation 5.

This mission shows off what Cold War can do on a PlayStation 5 by taking players on an aerial hunt to find Perseus during the Vietnam War.  

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has a number of flashback missions. In this 4K gameplay, players head to Vietnam to take part in a helicopter assault on an enemy village. We get to meet younger versions of some of the game's main characters, including CIA officers Russell Adler and Lawrence Sims as they discover the Russian superspy Perseus.  

When looking at how Cold War looks on PS5, this level has a wide range of terrain, including a muddy American base, the jungle from the air, rivers, and town. This level also shows air-to-ground transitions. On PlayStation 5, Call of Duty enhancements can include 4K, high dynamic range, and ray-tracing.  

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

## PS5 Demon's Soul's Remake: Classic Camera and Filter 4k Gameplay

The new PS5 remake of Demon's Souls makes a variety of adjustments to the From Software game to modernize it, but you can also opt to play with a classic camera and filter to make it more closely resemble the original version.

The new PS5 remake of Demon's Souls sets out to recreate the original game with various modern touches while still delivering the same core experience. Among other things, the look and camera have both been updated, but if you prefer a look that more closely resembles the original From Software version of the game, you're in luck.

Developer Bluepoint Games has included both a classic filter and camera angle option, which does away with the more modern-style camera that's enabled by default in the remake. That way, you can see what feels best for you. The classic filter will also deliver a visual style more in line with the PS3 game, while there are other options on that front, including a black-and-white mode.

Demon's Souls releases alongside the PlayStation 5 on November 12. It's among the first wave of next-gen games with an increased price tag, selling for $70 in the US.
