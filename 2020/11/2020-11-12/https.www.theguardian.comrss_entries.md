## Saving Britain’s Pubs With Tom Kerridge review – closing time for the great British boozer?

<p>The nation’s publicans were already struggling before Covid, and the pandemic has only made things worse. Who better than the genial TV chef to investigate what can be done</p><p>I did not foresee that I would need to warn you to take care of your tender heart when watching Saving Britain’s Pubs With Tom Kerridge (BBC Two). I assumed from the title and all our many years of viewing experience and training in the “reality/makeover/salvation of inanimate entities” genre that this would be a gentle jog-trot through a revamp of a tired old boozer or two, possibly with a recalcitrant landlord adding a little spice by initially resisting clearly much-needed change before coming to see the error of his broken-veined, whiskery ways. A lighter version of Gordon Ramsay Goes Mad at Morons – or whatever his latest franchise is called – given that TV chef Kerridge is a preternaturally gentle presence.</p><p>Instead, we got a much more dense and moving slice of life, contemporary business, British social history and a lot of other things in between – including, yes, some personal backstories and a touch of recalcitrance, but as part of a much wider picture. An entire sociocultural and commercial ecosystem is laid out for us, instead of furiously edited material manipulated to give us a vision the producers had had in mind all along. It feels very strange to be treated with such unexpected respect and concern as a viewer; I hope the participants enjoyed the rare experience as much at their end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/12/saving-britains-pubs-with-tom-kerridge-review-closing-time-for-the-great-british-boozer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Business secretary almost made it through unscathed until he was reminded of Brexit disruption to vaccine supply chain</p><p>Cometh the hour, cometh the man. When the UK has become the first European country to record more than 50,000 coronavirus deaths and the entire staff inside No 10 is squabbling over who gets to have the prime minister’s ear by becoming his chief of staff, the last thing the government wanted was another inconvenient Downing Street press briefing. But one had been promised and one must be delivered. And in such tricky circumstances there was clearly only one minister suitable for the job. Step forward Alok Sharma.</p><p>Not even the business secretary is entirely sure how he came to be business secretary. He doesn’t even seem to have much interest in politics, let alone business. Rather it was a case of one thing leading to another. He had seen which way the wind was blowing in the Tory leadership contest, had declared himself a huge fan of Boris Johnson, despite never having knowingly declared any great enthusiasm for Brexit, and was rewarded – to his and everyone else’s surprise – with a place in the cabinet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/12/no-10-wanted-to-pull-off-a-covid-briefing-but-they-called-alok-sharma">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Biden and the climate crisis: fight for net zero | Editorial

<p>A US president who recognises the threat will make a huge difference, but environmentalists must push hard</p><p>There is no question that Joe Biden’s win will make a big difference to international efforts to deal with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/ng-interactive/2020/oct/05/climate-data-dashboard-carbon-atmosphere-sea-level-arctic-ice" title="">climate emergency</a>. A US president who recognises global heating as an “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/10/joe-biden-presidency-white-house-racial-justice-covid-science" title="">existential threat</a>” will be a vital extra pillar propping up the teetering edifice of climate diplomacy. Four years of Donald Trump have done huge damage to the US’s reputation. But the world’s biggest economy, and second-biggest emitter of greenhouse gases (after China), remains vastly influential. With President Biden in charge, the prospects for next year’s Cop26 talks in Scotland, when drastic emissions cuts must be agreed if the world is to stand a chance of avoiding catastrophic heating, are already brighter.</p><p>President Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/04/us-paris-climate-agreement-exit-election" title="">withdrawal of the US</a> from the Paris agreement was a key plank of his nationalist “America first” agenda and an act of sabotage against both the UN climate process and the principle of a rules-based international order. It also gave cover to the world’s other climate vandals: Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Russia and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/08/australia-warned-it-could-be-isolated-over-climate-inaction-after-joe-biden-victory" title="">Australia</a>. With Mr Biden, that cover is gone, and ecocidal policies such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/12/amazon-matter-of-life-and-death-for-all-of-us-we-must-fight-for-it" title="">Amazon rainforest destruction</a> and coal-power expansion should come under renewed and relentless pressure. It is striking that the president-elect put <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/12/joe-biden-us-allies-climate-crisis-trump" title="">climate</a> at the heart of his phone calls with foreign leaders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/12/the-guardian-view-on-biden-and-the-climate-crisis-fight-for-net-zero">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Where shops were open and sales booming, there was no case for a year’s relief from business rates</p><p>It’s bad enough that the big supermarkets, sporting their best sales figures in years, were given a pandemic freebie by Rishi Sunak in the form of a year’s relief from business rates. But the case of the discount retailer B&amp;M, clinging to its £38m from the Treasury even as it pays a £250m special dividend to shareholders, is more extreme.</p><p>B&amp;M in April found itself in a near-perfect competitive position. Since it sells food, it was classed as an essential retailer, and so could keep its 656 UK stores open. But, because its shelves are also stuffed with toys, games, furniture, stationery, rugs and so on, it also had the run of the inessential retailing pitch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/nils-pratley-on-finance/2020/nov/12/treasury-b-and-m-covid-rates-freebie-shops-business-rates-relief">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A goofy underdog shapes up for a marriage-ready makeover in Hansal Mehta’s finely balanced romp</p><p>The housebound Diwali celebrations of 2020 kick off with this appreciably daft comedy on an enduring theme of Indian cinema: the goon’s redemption. In the lead, we find Rajkummar Rao, the elastic underdog who played the lovelorn playwright in last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/feb/02/ek-ladki-ko-dekha-toh-aisa-laga-review-lesbian-groundbreaker-is-crowdpleaser">Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga</a>. What’s funny about his role as Montu, a small-town PE teacher several degrees more childish than his students, is that he’s a beta male convinced he’s an alpha, as inflated as the splendiferous quiff he maintains, possibly to cultivate an illusion of height. His remodelling into marriage material plays out like an extended “physician, heal thyself” riff. Heard the one about the PE teacher who needed to shape up?</p><p>And so the script, by writer-producer Luv Ranjan, has the rigidity of a fitness plan. A prize is dangled before the protagonist: Nushrat Bharucha as Neelu, the new colleague whose parents Montu’s thuggish mates have harassed in a park. An obstacle is established in Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub’s moustachioed cricket coach, with whom Montu brawls in a sandpit. Around them, director Hansal Mehta stages a series of challenges designed to help our boy realise the man he could be if he puts in the work. It’s a matter of character, finally, with the script pursuing the idea that Montu’s bluffness is really a shield for bruised self-esteem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/12/chhalaang-review-indian-comedy-hansal-mehta-rajkummar-rao">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It tangled Spider-Man and dethroned The Crown – but keeps Bond alive.

Having supplanted the form of Percival Graves, a high-ranking wizard in the American Ministry of Magic played by Colin Farrell, the character makes his entrance as the music thuds and the camera weaves … and there sits Johnny Depp. Someviewers shrugged their shoulders. Others wished Farrell had stayed.</p><p>Yet Depp remained in the role – and gave a lively performance in the follow-up, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/nov/08/fantastic-beasts-the-crimes-of-grindelwald-review-jude-law-dumbledore-shines-in-saggy-sequel">The Crimes of Grindelwald</a> – or he did until this week, when he “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/06/johnny-depp-fantastic-beasts-resign-franchise-statement">stepped down</a>” following his failed libel case against the Sun.

<p><strong>Available online</strong><br />Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell’s characters deconstruct their own lines in a witty four-hander staged cleverly for streaming</p><p>From Singin’ in the Rain to A Chorus Line, there is a grand tradition of musicals about making a musical. But, as its name suggests, [Title of Show] gets extra meta. It was written in 2004 by Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell as a last-minute submission for the New York Musical festival. Its plot follows two pals, Jeff and Hunter, as they – stick with me here – write a show about a show that they’re writing for the New York Musical festival. “We could put this exact conversation in the show,” suggests Hunter. But, he wonders, “would other people want to watch something like that?”</p><p>The answer is it depends on how meta you like your theatre and how much you love musicals. [Title of Show] comes stuffed with obscure Broadway references and industry in-jokes as the cast announce their own key changes and its nerdy creators argue over whether you can rhyme sweeter with theatre. At times it threatens to deconstruct to the point of self-destruction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/12/title-of-show-review-jeff-bowen-hunter-bell-lambert-jackson-london-coliseum">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whereas the Trust wants to explore its historic links to slavery, the right wants to preserve an unreal version of the past</p><p>The National Trust is in trouble. Earlier this week, 26 MPs and two peers from the recently formed “Common Sense Group” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/2020/11/09/letterswill-police-break-armistice-day-ceremonies-wednesday/">wrote</a> to the Daily Telegraph recommending that the heritage organisation’s funding applications to public bodies be reviewed in light of its having “tarnished one of Britain’s greatest sons [Winston Churchill] by linking his family home, Chartwell, with slavery and colonialism”. The same paper reported on the Trust’s AGM, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/11/08/national-trust-members-accuse-board-woke-agenda-stormy-virtual/">portraying</a> it as a revolt of disregarded members, such as “Diana from Leicester”, who complained that the “majority of members just want to see beautiful houses and gardens, not have others’ opinions pushed down their throats”. The Trust, it is darkly hinted, “could face an official investigation”, a prospect that Lady Stowell, head of the Charity Commission, has <a href="https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/rebecca-cooney-national-trust-deserves-better-baroness-stowell/governance/article/1698308">done little to downplay</a>.</p><p>The National Trust’s major crime was to have produced a <a href="https://nt.global.ssl.fastly.net/documents/colionialism-and-historic-slavery-report.pdf">report</a> in September that examined Trust properties’ relationship to the slave trade and colonialism. It explored how the proceeds of foreign conquest and the slavery economy built and furnished houses and properties, endowed the families who kept them, and in many ways helped to create the idyll of the country house. None of this is news to most people with a passing acquaintance with history, and the report made no solid recommendations beyond the formation of an advisory group and reiterating a commitment to communicating the histories of its properties in an inclusive manner. So, why the dramatics?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/12/national-trust-history-slavery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The pandemic has disrupted life in so many ways for adults and children alike, making the therapeutic and educational benefits of play vital in helping kids navigate an uncertain time</p><p>Before March 2020, few of us had heard the terms “self-isolation”, “lockdown” and “social-distancing” – but they have now become ubiquitous as we adjust to living through a global pandemic. So it’s not surprising that lockdown has left a third of children feeling more worried or stressed, according to a <a href="https://www.barnardos.org.uk/news/generation-lockdown-third-children-and-young-people-experience-increased-mental-health" rel="nofollow">recent poll</a> conducted by YouGov on behalf of Barnardo’s.</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/public-health-england-launches-new-every-mind-matters-campaign" rel="nofollow">Another survey</a> by YouGov, for Public Health England (PHE), found that more than half of parents with children aged five to 18 said that their primary concern for their children was their mental wellbeing. Almost a quarter of parents said that not knowing what action to take had prevented them supporting their children’s mental wellbeing. PHE recommends establishing a routine and encouraging children to indulge in their interests and hobbies to help counteract this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/childs-play-and-learning/2020/nov/12/while-were-going-through-such-change-we-have-to-engage-our-children-the-importance-of-play-during-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

This presidential election drama was a great talking point in its day – not least because it daringly made mention of real-life contenders of the time such as Thomas Dewey and Robert Taft. Hepburn plays Mary Matthews, the estranged wife of an industrial tycoon (Spencer Tracy) who is running for office on the Republican ticket, a campaign secretly bankrolled by his wealthy mistress (Angela Lansbury). Mary agrees to return to his side because of his manifest idealism, but wobbles as he appears to get slowly sucked in to the cynical political world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/12/katharine-hepburn-20-best-films-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

It also said that the newly established trade and agriculture commission was to be put on a statutory footing. It would provide independent advice on post-Brexit trade deals as they pass through parliament. Campaigners celebrated what looked like another government U-turn. The UK’s high food and animal welfare standards would be defended. Hurrah, and so on.</p><p>Well, up to a point. There was a more reliable way to protect those standards. During its passage through parliament there were three attempts to amend the agriculture bill so as to enshrine them in law. The government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/12/mps-reject-calls-by-campaigners-to-enshrine-food-safety-in-uk-law" title="">voted them all down</a>. It hasn’t even come up with a basic trade policy which establishes what its red lines are. And as it stands, the review process for each trade deal lasts only three weeks, which is completely inadequate for such extraordinarily complex treaties. Finally, each trade deal will now be taken on a case-by-case basis in the Commons, where the government has a robust 80-seat majority. Can we guarantee standards will be upheld by this government? No, we cannot.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/12/chlorinated-chicken-trade-deal-britain-america-nothing-appetising-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

## Rainbow bright! How the symbol of optimism and joy spread across our clothes, homes and lives in 2020

<p>Appearing in windows and bookshelves, the rainbow became the defining motif of the year. Now, they are everywhere from trainers to Christmas decorations – and are big business. What’s behind this new optimism economy?<br /></p><p>The rainbows started appearing all over Italy within a few days of schools closing for the first lockdown, back in March. Crayon drawings were taped to the inside of windows; poster-painted banners hung from balconies. When the pandemic came to Britain the rainbows came too, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/everything-will-be-alright-italians-share-slogan-of-hope-in-face-of-coronavirus-crisis">with the Italian message of positivity</a> <em>andrà tutto bene</em> (everything will be all right) morphing into thanks to the NHS. Then, during the months of lockdown, the rainbows moved inside our homes, with a craze for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/sep/19/why-the-home-edit-shouldnt-judge-a-book-by-its-cover">arranging books by colour</a> in pursuit of an aesthetically pleasing Zoom backdrop.<br /><br />The rainbow is to 2020 what “keep calm and carry on” was to 1939. And, just as “keep calm and carry on” <a href="http://www.moidigital.ac.uk/blog/keep-calm-and-carry-75/">began as a public information campaign</a> but became <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/apr/20/how-we-made-keep-calm-and-carry-on-poster">a tea towel industry</a>, what began as a gesture of hope is now big business. John Lewis reports that an <a href="https://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-partners-pop-art-rainbow-bauble-multi/p4981098">£8 rainbow bauble </a>is an early festive bestseller. (After a decade of tasteful soft-white fairy lights, I predict a comeback this year for multicoloured Christmas tree lights – rebranded, no doubt, as “rainbow lights”.) Shiver ’n’ Shake Rainbow Kate, a gaudy-haired £40 doll with a thermometer for reading her temperature when she shakes with “fever”, is tipped as one of the toys of the season.

## How western travel influencers got tangled up in Pakistan's politics

<p>Travel bloggers have flocked to Pakistan in recent years – but have some of them become too close to the authorities? </p><p>Long before she became headline news in Pakistan, Cynthia Dawn Ritchie was simply a tourist. In 2009, Ritchie, an American woman living in Houston, Texas, took a trip to Karachi, the sprawling megacity in southern Pakistan. At the time, Pakistan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jul/08/from-the-archives-karachi-vice-inside-the-city-torn-apart-by-killings-extortion-and-terrorism-podcast" title="">was beset</a> by terrorist violence, and the travel advice of most western countries could be summarised as “don’t go”. But Ritchie had been persuaded by friends who knew the city. “My Pakistani friends said: ‘Cynthia, you’ve travelled much of the world, but you haven’t been to Pakistan, why not come?’ I was like: ‘Sure, why not?’,” Ritchie told me.</p><p>After a couple of weeks eating seafood and sightseeing, Ritchie went back to Houston, where she worked in communications and other roles for local government. The next year, she made a few more trips to Pakistan, funded by various Pakistani-American organisations. Houston is twinned with Karachi, and Ritchie told me that back then she “represented the city as an informal goodwill ambassador”. As foreigners in Pakistan often are, she was immediately offered exciting opportunities – working with local NGOs, advising the health department about social media, giving lectures. That year, she decided to move to Pakistan permanently. “I just felt a kinship here, that I belonged here and had a sense of purpose,” she said when we first spoke earlier this year. She settled in the leafy, relatively secure capital city, Islamabad, where most westerners in Pakistan – diplomats, journalists, aid workers – also lived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/12/western-travel-influencers-social-media-pakistan-politics">Continue reading...</a>

At the judge’s US supreme court confirmation hearing, Hill, his former aide, claimed he had sexually harassed her. Kimberlé Crenshaw was assisting Hill’s legal team and felt dejected and exhausted. As she left the capitol building in Washington DC that day, she saw a group of African Americans, mostly women, gathered at the bottom of the steps in a prayer circle. She let out a sigh of relief and walked towards them.</p><p>“I thought: ‘Oh, thank God, a place we can go and embrace each other, because this is a struggle,’” Crenshaw says. It was the day before Thomas’ confirmation, and she felt the future of the civil rights movement was on the line. But when she reached the group, she saw they were wearing T-shirts proclaiming their support for Thomas. She watched with dread as they sang songs of praise and called Hill a jezebel. “It was like a horror film,” she says. “You think you’re safe, but it turns out that the people you’re running to are actually infected with whatever you’re running from.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/12/kimberle-crenshaw-the-woman-who-revolutionised-feminism-and-landed-at-the-heart-of-the-culture-wars">Continue reading...</a>

Karen Ward is a deeply religious former police officer who, despite growing up in a Democratic household, backed Donald Trump in 2016 and voted again for him this month. Karen Cotter, who is a liberal, believes Trump is a “menace to society”.
