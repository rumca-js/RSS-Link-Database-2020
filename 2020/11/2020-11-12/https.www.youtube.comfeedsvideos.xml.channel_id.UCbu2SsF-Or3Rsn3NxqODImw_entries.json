We already compared the game's Xbox One X version to its Series X upgrade, with the Series X version having clear improvements over last gen, but what differences can we expect between Series X and Sony's new PlayStation 5?\n\nIn the video above, we take the same Assassin's Creed Valhalla save file and, thanks to the cloud, use it on both platforms, to compare as fairly as possible. We also used the same capture device and in-game settings. We compare the fast travel load times between Norway and England, and take a look at how the visuals and performance differ between the platforms. You'll see that the differences are negligible, but a keen eye may be able to spot them.\n\nTake a look at the video to discern the key differences between the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions of the game.

Ahead of the launch of Cold War, we\u2019re here to catch you up on the central plots and the journeys of characters like Woods, Mason, and Hudson.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War takes place between the original Black Ops 1 and its sequel, Black Ops II--releasing in 2010 and 2012, respectively. Given that it's been a while, we feel a refresher on the Black Ops characters and plot points is in order.\n\nIn the video above, we go over where we left off with central characters like Alex Mason, Frank Woods, and Jason Hudson, as well as which villains are still alive and what story cliffhangers are worth keeping in mind. If you haven't played the first Black Ops, the game involves a lot of twisting plot points, including an attempt to assassinate Fidel Castro, a brainwashing program that has to do with mysterious numbers, chemical weapons, and betrayals. \n\nBlack Ops Cold War picks up 13 years after Black Ops with Russian spy Perseus infiltrating the United States nuclear weapons program. A new cast of operatives--Russell Adler and Lawrence Sims from the CIA, Eleazar from Mossad, and Helen Park from MI6--are trying to stop Perseus. The campaign bounces back and forth between the present day (1980s Europe) and flashbacks to the past, which take place in Vietnam. \n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War releases on November 13 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOYm5vUvoPw", "date_published": "2020-11-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Demon's Souls PS5 Remake vs PS3 Original", "description": "In this latest comparison, we take a look at how the brand-new Demon's Souls remake on PlayStation 5 stacks up against the original game on the PlayStation 3. Check out the similarities and the differences some 11 years later.\n\nDeveloper Bluepoint Studios' remake of Demon's Souls is finally here, releasing for PlayStation 5. The remake launches about 11 years after the original Demon's Souls, developed by From Software for PlayStation 3. Don't know about y'all, but we think that a comparison is in order.\n\nIn the video above, we play through Demon's Souls on PS3 and Demon's Souls remake on PS5. When seen side-by-side, the differences of when the two games were made, and the changes brought about by 11 years of technological progress, are fairly obvious. However, you can also see how similar the two games are as well--the remake may give Demon's Souls a fresh coat of paint but it's still the same hard-as-hell game with a terrifying atmosphere that From Software released back in 2009. \n\nDemon's Souls is the comparatively niche older brother to the rest of From Software's Soulsborne games, which include Dark Souls, Dark Souls II, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls III. Though it's not as popular as these games, Demon's Souls is pretty much the start of what would later be called the soulslike genre--even if the genre's popularity and acceptance into the mainstream is more directly connected to Dark Souls.\n\nDemon's Souls releases as an exclusive launch title for PlayStation 5.\n\n0:00 Intro Cutscene Comparison\n0:35 Gameplay Comparison of the Outpost Passage\n01:25 Forlorn Outpost Area Comparison and Loading Comparison\n01:53 Nexus Cutscene Comparison\n03:08 Talking to NPCs in the Nexus\n03:38 Boletaria Cutscene Comparison", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-STvkLKIHQ", "date_published": "2020-11-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5 (4K) Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War \"Fracture Jaw\" Gameplay", "description": "This mission shows off what Cold War can do on a PlayStation 5 by taking players on an aerial hunt to find Perseus during the Vietnam War.  \n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has a number of flashback missions.

Among other things, the look and camera have both been updated, but if you prefer a look that more closely resembles the original From Software version of the game, you're in luck.\n\nDeveloper Bluepoint Games has included both a classic filter and camera angle option, which does away with the more modern-style camera that's enabled by default in the remake. That way, you can see what feels best for you. The classic filter will also deliver a visual style more in line with the PS3 game, while there are other options on that front, including a black-and-white mode.\n\nDemon's Souls releases alongside the PlayStation 5 on November 12.
