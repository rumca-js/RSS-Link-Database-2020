One year ago today — Nov. 11, 2019 — we premiered this recording of mandolin virtuoso Chris Thile performing a live set at the Fine Line in Minneapolis. You'll be blown away by Thile's spellbinding solo performance, and you'll be equally charmed by the audience's reaction. Watching this video will bring back to mind everything you love about seeing live music. 

These performances come from Chris Thile's MicroShow. We are grateful to New Belgium Brewing for its support of The Current's MicroShow series.
