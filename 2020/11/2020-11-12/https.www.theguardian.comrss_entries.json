In 2009, Ritchie, an American woman living in Houston, Texas, took a trip to Karachi, the sprawling megacity in southern Pakistan. At the time, Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jul/08/from-the-archives-karachi-vice-inside-the-city-torn-apart-by-killings-extortion-and-terrorism-podcast\" title=\"\">was beset</a> by terrorist violence, and the travel advice of most western countries could be summarised as \u201cdon\u2019t go\u201d. But Ritchie had been persuaded by friends who knew the city. \u201cMy Pakistani friends said: \u2018Cynthia, you\u2019ve travelled much of the world, but you haven\u2019t been to Pakistan, why not come?\u2019 I was like: \u2018Sure, why not?\u2019,\u201d Ritchie told me.</p><p>After a couple of weeks eating seafood and sightseeing, Ritchie went back to Houston, where she worked in communications and other roles for local government. The next year, she made a few more trips to Pakistan, funded by various Pakistani-American organisations. Houston is twinned with Karachi, and Ritchie told me that back then she \u201crepresented the city as an informal goodwill ambassador\u201d. As foreigners in Pakistan often are, she was immediately offered exciting opportunities \u2013 working with local NGOs, advising the health department about social media, giving lectures. That year, she decided to move to Pakistan permanently. \u201cI just felt a kinship here, that I belonged here and had a sense of purpose,\u201d she said when we first spoke earlier this year. She settled in the leafy, relatively secure capital city, Islamabad, where most westerners in Pakistan \u2013 diplomats, journalists, aid workers \u2013 also lived.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/12/western-travel-influencers-social-media-pakistan-politics\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/12/western-travel-influencers-social-media-pakistan-politics", "date_published": "2020-11-12 06:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw: the woman who revolutionised feminism \u2013 and landed at the heart of the culture wars", "description": "<p>From police brutality to sexual harassment, the lawyer fights to ensure black women\u2019s experiences are not ignored.
