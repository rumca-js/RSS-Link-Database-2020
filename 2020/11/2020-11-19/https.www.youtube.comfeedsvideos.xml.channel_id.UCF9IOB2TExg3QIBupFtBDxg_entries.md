Blacksburg, Virginia

Civil and environmental engineer

Ten feet pace (6 recommended) 

Ventilation

More air flow than recommended by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers

We don't see outbreaks above a certain threshold

And the gym with the open doors was way above that

Carbon dioxide monitor to track indoor levels

Tape on the floor to mark areas

No wandering around the gym

No partner workouts

Ventilation redesign

A gym trainer exposed 50 

No one else got sick

Some decided to get tested, all tested negative

Followed up for 2 weeks

Oxford vaccine phase 2 publications

Â£3 per dose

50,000 participants globally

When????

Prof Andrew Pollard, (Study lead from Oxford)

absolutely delighted with the results

we're seeing the immune responses look exactly the same, even in those who are over 70 years of age

Levels of efficacy

Neutralising antibodies

T cells

not there yet

Data release probably, before Christmas

No competition with other vaccines

Multiple vaccines needed, We will need all of them to protect people around the globe

Russia

Cases, + 23,610 

United States, India, Brazil, France, Russia

Deaths, + 463 = 34,850

Moscow is the worst hit area

WHO

Europe, one death every 17 seconds (WHO)

Surge in cases, Europe and the Americas

Countries, case finding, care and isolation, cluster investigations, adequate testing with rapid results, contact tracing and supported quarantine, are facing much less disruption.

Those countries that are letting the virus run unchecked are playing with fire

Further needless deaths and suffering

A significant number of people experiencing long-term effects of the virus

Mental health pressures

Act fast, act now, act decisively

Health being seen as an investment rather than a cost 

A new collective way forward is needed
