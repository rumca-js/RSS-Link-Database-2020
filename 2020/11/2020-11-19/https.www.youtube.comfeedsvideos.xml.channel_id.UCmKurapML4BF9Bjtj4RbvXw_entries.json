It\u2019s safe to say that Covid has thrown us for a \u201cloop.\u201d In nothing short of a miracle, last year, before the pandemic showed up, we had determined as a group to take our first break from touring in 10 years and focus on family during 2020. It might have been the first time our plans actually matched up with our reality.\n\nWe love performing. Touring can be grueling. I dread the inevitable tour-induced insomnia. During a recent tour I was determined to make something of my sleeplessness. My friend Devin, who works in an international ancestry research company, inspired me to dig into my family history. With his help, I found a slew of stories -- profound stories of my great great grandfathers and grandmothers and how they overcame an impossible past to make our family\u2019s future possible. In my insomnia, during many late nights on tour, I summarized and rewrote these incredible accounts in first person addressed to my children, so that I could read them as our bedtime stories. That way, my children\u2019s heroes would be their ancestors -- their own kin. The lesson we could learn together was this:\n\nIf THEY could do hard things then WE can do hard things too.\n\nResilience is inheritable. \n\nWhat does this have to do with this video? Everything.\n\nIn this music video, we sped through an eerily empty natural history museum and a public library -- something we could only do during Covid. Why? To prove the same point and send the same message asserted in these bedtime stories. We have grand places like these that you see in this video all throughout our world. They are monuments to human resilience. They house exhibits and shelve books upon books of biographical buoyancy. They showcase hard-earned scientific scenes that serve as the shoulders upon which we stand today -- evidence written into the very fabric of our earth\u2019s crust of how hard things are what we do. We\u2019re built for them. We\u2019re made for them. \n\nAnd all those that have gone before cry out to us -- wanting to mean something to someone. To be someone to us.\n\nSomeone to You.\n\nIt\u2019s not as much about WHAT is in our past, but WHO is in our past. Our ancestors stand ennobled by their own grit and perseverance earned through things much harder than what we face, not only to inform our future, but also to endow us with much needed strength for whatever is ahead. They\u2019ve earned our respect, gratitude and our commitment to overcome. \n\n\u201cWhen our hearts turn to our ancestors, something changes inside us. We feel part of something greater than ourselves.\u201d\n-Russell M.
