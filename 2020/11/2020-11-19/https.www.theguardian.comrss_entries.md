<p>A contract extension gives the manager time to revamp, adapt to new challenges and address unfinished business</p><p>Manchester City’s longest-serving manager was a tactical innovator born far from England who pioneered the use of a withdrawn centre-forward. Pep Guardiola will still have a long way to go to match the 13 years the India-born Les McDowall, who won the 1956 FA Cup and devised the Revie plan, spent in charge of City but if he sees out his new contract he will have been there for seven, more than anybody else other than Wilf Wild, who saw the club through the second world war.</p><p>Seven years at any club represents a remarkable achievement in the modern game, particularly at one so historically prone to volatility as City and especially so for the 49-year-old Guardiola, whose intensity was supposed to restrict the time he could spend at any one place. That may yet become a problem but equally no club have ever been set up quite so precisely to meet the demands of a manager as City were for Guardiola.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/19/pep-guardiola-gets-chance-to-build-his-second-great-manchester-city-team">Continue reading...</a>

But when you’re trying to convince the country and the US president-elect that your government isn’t in a bit of a mess after the departure of several senior No 10 advisers and that you do have some vaguely credible ideas, then you make do with what you’ve got.

It might have come as a surprise to him that much of the retreat had been on his own party’s watch as the Conservatives have been in power for more than 10 years and it is they who had been cutting the defence budget by £8bn.

## 'My mother was like a steel fist in a velvet glove': the real Audrey Hepburn

<p>Her delicate beauty and starring roles made her seem fragile. But having endured an unloving mother and a perilous childhood under Nazi occupation, such an impression belied Hepburn’s remarkable strength, compassion and resolve</p><p>“Very alert, very smart, very talented, very ambitious.” That was the director William Wyler’s verdict after watching a screen test for Roman Holiday by a young chorus girl called Audrey Hepburn in 1951. She got the part, won an Oscar and the rest is history. For decades, Hepburn has been adored for her graceful beauty and style. But somehow, the “smart”, “talented” and “ambitious” woman Wyler described never makes it into the books about her enduring charm with titles such as <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Be-Lovely-Audrey-Hepburn/dp/1861059329#:~:text=Enhanced%20by%20rarely%20seen%20photographs,role%20model%20for%20women%20today.">How to Be Lovely: The Audrey Hepburn Way</a>. Now a new documentary, Audrey, gives us a more complex picture of the woman.</p><p>Directed by Helena Coan, the film features never-before-seen archive footage of Hepburn alongside intimate interviews with her family and friends. Speaking on Zoom from his home in Italy, Hepburn’s eldest son, Sean Hepburn Ferrer, says his mother’s steeliness is often overlooked. “She was no pushover. You have to fight in Hollywood for every little bit, and she did. But she played the part of the ingenue. And that’s who she was, too. None of us are just one way or another.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/19/my-mother-was-like-a-steel-fist-in-a-velvet-glove-the-real-audrey-hepburn">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joe Biden will enter the White House in 2021 facing numerous domestic crises. But as Patrick Wintour explains, he cannot ignore the rest of the world</p><p>When Donald Trump took office four years ago it was with the mantra ‘America first’. International agreements were torn up, the US withdrew from commitments like the Paris climate agreement and cut its funding for the World Health Organization. Allies in Europe were scorned in favour of creating new relationships with ‘strongmen’ leaders such as Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un. </p><p>Now, as Joe Biden prepares to enter the White House he is promising to repair damaged relations and rejoin global institutions. But as the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, <strong>Patrick Wintour, </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana, </strong>the next four years will not be simply spent turning the clock back on global affairs: instead Biden will forge his own foreign policy based on promoting democracy and standing up to authoritarianism. It’s a change in tone that will have ramifications too in Britain, where a Brexit deal and an orderly exit from the EU (now without the prospect of a Trump-blessed US trade deal) is becoming ever more important.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/19/how-will-joe-biden-reset-us-relations-with-the-world-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
