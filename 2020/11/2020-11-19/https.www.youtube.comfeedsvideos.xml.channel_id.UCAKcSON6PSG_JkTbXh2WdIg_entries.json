The band's two nights of hometown shows came just two months after the release of their \"Bambi\" album, and capped off their fall 2018 U.S. tour. The Current crew were on hand for one of those two sold-out shows, providing a live video stream of the concert to fans enjoying the show remotely. Watch three performances from that November 2018 show by Hippo Campus at the Palace Theatre.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Way It Goes\"\n4:23 \"Monsoon\"\n9:55 \"South\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nWhistler Isaiah Allen \u2013 drums, backing vocals\nDeCarlo Jackson \u2013 trumpet, keys\nJake Luppen - lead vocals, guitar\nNathan Stocker - lead guitar/vocals\nZach Sutton \u2013 bass, keys\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/08/08/hippo-campus-in-studio\n2016 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/06/13/hippo-campus-perform-in-the-current-studio\n2016 Rock the Garden performance:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/06/30/hippo-campus-perform-at-rock-the-garden-2016\n2017 Icehouse performance of \"Landmark\" album:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2017/02/20/watch-hippo-campus-perform-landmark-in-its-entirety\n2018 Palace Theatre concert:\nhttps://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/11/19/watch-hippo-campus-live-from-the-palace-theatre\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#hippocampus", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBHsN_r8y_o", "date_published": "2020-11-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Nikki Lane - three songs at The Current (2014; 2017)", "description": "Six years ago, on Nov. 18, 2014, Nikki Lane visited our studio for a session hosted by Mark Wheat.
