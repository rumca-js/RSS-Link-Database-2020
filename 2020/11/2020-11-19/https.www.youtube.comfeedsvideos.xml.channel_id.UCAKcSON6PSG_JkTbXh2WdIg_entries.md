Two years ago, Hippo Campus performed back-to-back shows at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minn. The band's two nights of hometown shows came just two months after the release of their "Bambi" album, and capped off their fall 2018 U.S. tour. The Current crew were on hand for one of those two sold-out shows, providing a live video stream of the concert to fans enjoying the show remotely. Watch three performances from that November 2018 show by Hippo Campus at the Palace Theatre.
