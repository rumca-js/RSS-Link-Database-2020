However, it's not all digital sunshine and rainbows with these news consoles.\u00a0\n\nLike a lot of newly released hardware, reports have emerged detailing issues with both Sony and Microsoft's new consoles. Along with the many forum posts, tweets, and screams into the ether, we've had our own run-ins with crashes, weird bugs, and general instability.\u00a0\n\nSo, on this episode of Generation Next, we're taking the time to examine the state of the new consoles, discuss the major issues that have been reported, and recount our own anecdotal experiences. More importantly, we talk about whether you should be worried about any of the problems that are cropping up.\n\nGeneration Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ram\u00e9e, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.\n\n00:00 - Intro\n01:28 - PS5 Digital Editions coming with a disc drive\n02:44 - PS5 Rest Mode issues\n05:22 - Other PS5 issues: DualSense charging, defaulting to PS4 games, etc.\n06:55 - First PS5 system patch\n07:43 - PS5 hardware issues vs. software issues\n12:15 - Xbox Series X disc drive issues\n13:28 - Other Series X issues: Wi-Fi disconnecting, power supply issues, etc.\n15:15 - Don't believe the clickbait lies!\n16:26 - Should you be worried?\n17:46 - Outro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cxX8pTxrszc", "date_published": "2020-11-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Every Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Calamity Story Cutscene", "description": "Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity has a massive amount of cutscenes that tell a big story.

Like the first Hyrule Warriors, it's a Musuo-style game in the vein of Dynasty Warriors, which means you'll be beating down countless swaths of enemies. But that doesn't mean the action is mindless by any means, and there are some key strategies if you want to really up your combat game.\n\nIn the video above, GameSpot's Max Blumenthal runs through some advanced combat tips that will help you make the most of your time with Age of Calamity. The Stasis power from Breath of the Wild returns here, for example, but you don't want to simply spam it whenever possible--there are strategic ways to make use of Stasis to extend the time you have to attack weak points and to stun enemies for longer.\n\nMax also covers the game's wildly powerful Impa, techniques to help if you're having difficulty nailing the timing on parrying or dodging, and why the Magnesis ability is much more powerful than you might think. \n\nFor much more, check out our Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review.

In this video,\u00a0we\u2019ve got a side-by-side comparison of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. We\u2019re putting the\u00a0PlayStation\u00a05 up against the Xbox Series X and comparing graphics and sounds from the first few missions of the\u00a0campaign.\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFor the first time, Call of Duty has offered a cross-generational bundle of a game. If you pick up this\u00a0special\u00a0version, you\u2019re able to cross-save between your last-gen\u00a0console to\u00a0your brand-new console released this year. You can also cross-save to another\u00a0generation\u00a0and\u00a0platform. We\u2019ve tested this out and were able to cross-save from a\u00a0PlayStation\u00a04 to an Xbox Series X\u00a0with no issue.\u00a0\n\nIn\u00a0our\u00a0review,\u00a0Kallie Plagge\u00a0explains,\u00a0\u201cIt's clear that a core theme of Cold War's story is that things are more complicated than just good or evil, and the ways in which this sequel plays off the original Black Ops underscore that. But like many Call of Duty stories, it only gestures at a greater point and stops short of making it. It's overall a fun action-movie story that absolutely delivers on the quintessential Black Ops twists and turns, but it ultimately walks back its more interesting and relevant questions--though I was completely invested in the story for the entire duration.\u201d", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxCyVczFFis", "date_published": "2020-11-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
