With reports that some brand new PS5 and Xbox Series X consoles are arriving broken, disc drives are acting up, and consoles are crashing in Rest Mode, the Generation Next gang discuss what it's like to be an early adopter of new hardware.

The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S are out now and, like you, we've been having a fantastic time playing games like Demon's Souls, Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Yakuza: Like A Dragon, Tetris Effect: Connected, and many more. However, it's not all digital sunshine and rainbows with these news consoles. 

Like a lot of newly released hardware, reports have emerged detailing issues with both Sony and Microsoft's new consoles. Along with the many forum posts, tweets, and screams into the ether, we've had our own run-ins with crashes, weird bugs, and general instability. 

So, on this episode of Generation Next, we're taking the time to examine the state of the new consoles, discuss the major issues that have been reported, and recount our own anecdotal experiences. More importantly, we talk about whether you should be worried about any of the problems that are cropping up.

Generation Next is GameSpot's weekly video show all about the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. Each Friday, join PlayStation Pro Tamoor Hussain, Xbox Xpert Jordan Ramée, and Console Connoisseur Lucy James as they discuss the biggest stories about the new consoles.

Hyrule Warriors is finally out and we're here to break down some extremely useful tips for those who are having a tough time in the fight!

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is a prequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it's a much different sort of game. Like the first Hyrule Warriors, it's a Musuo-style game in the vein of Dynasty Warriors, which means you'll be beating down countless swaths of enemies. But that doesn't mean the action is mindless by any means, and there are some key strategies if you want to really up your combat game.

In the video above, GameSpot's Max Blumenthal runs through some advanced combat tips that will help you make the most of your time with Age of Calamity. The Stasis power from Breath of the Wild returns here, for example, but you don't want to simply spam it whenever possible--there are strategic ways to make use of Stasis to extend the time you have to attack weak points and to stun enemies for longer.

Max also covers the game's wildly powerful Impa, techniques to help if you're having difficulty nailing the timing on parrying or dodging, and why the Magnesis ability is much more powerful than you might think. 

For much more, check out our Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review. The game is available now on Nintendo Switch.

Let's compare Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War on the latest consoles: the PS5 and Xbox Series X.

The next generation of video game consoles is here! In this video, we’ve got a side-by-side comparison of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War. We’re putting the PlayStation 5 up against the Xbox Series X and comparing graphics and sounds from the first few missions of the campaign.  
 
For the first time, Call of Duty has offered a cross-generational bundle of a game. If you pick up this special version, you’re able to cross-save between your last-gen console to your brand-new console released this year. You can also cross-save to another generation and platform. We’ve tested this out and were able to cross-save from a PlayStation 4 to an Xbox Series X with no issue. 

In our review, Kallie Plagge explains, “It's clear that a core theme of Cold War's story is that things are more complicated than just good or evil, and the ways in which this sequel plays off the original Black Ops underscore that. But like many Call of Duty stories, it only gestures at a greater point and stops short of making it. It's overall a fun action-movie story that absolutely delivers on the quintessential Black Ops twists and turns, but it ultimately walks back its more interesting and relevant questions--though I was completely invested in the story for the entire duration.”
