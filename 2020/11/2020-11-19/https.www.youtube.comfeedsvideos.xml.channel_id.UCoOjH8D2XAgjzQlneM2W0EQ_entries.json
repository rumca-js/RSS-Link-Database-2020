And you wanna get an edge on a business competitor that\u2019s been on your tail. If you could get your hands on your competitors proprietary technology, you could turn the tide on profits! Maybe instead of getting your hands on their technology secrets, maybe you could use some photos of your competitor\u2019s CEO in a \u201ccompromised\u201d position? Maybe some internal documents could help?\n\nSpying never changes - it\u2019s all about getting information - intelligence from other humans. Some people will get trained through government intelligence agencies, then quit to sell those skills to the private sector. It\u2019s so bad that some insiders say this intelligence \u201cbrain drain\u201d is hurting US national security.\n\nCorporate espionage is expensive. It requires a lot of manpower and expertise that not many people have. On top of that, espionage doesn\u2019t always yield results. So how far people are willing to go to spy on their business enemies depends on how much money is involved.\n\nThe major espionage firms claim that they don\u2019t do anything shady. One reason is that unless the intel they get is used for shady things, intel obtained in a shady way isn\u2019t admissible in court. BUT, depending on the laws of the country they\u2019re operating in, almost anything goes.\n\nFor every corporate espionage assignment, you\u2019ll get a target to go after: this can be just plain information about something, documents, photographs, etc. Now, not everyone would be willing to betray their company, so the first step is to create a psychological profile of your ideal mole.\n\nAnother twist on this method is that if you seduce them but they\u2019re still giving you resistance on the juicy stuff you\u2019re really after, you can try to persuade them to reveal more inconsequential, less important details that are easier to squeeze out - but are still illegal to share none-the-less.\n\nIf there\u2019s a king in this corporate espionage game - in this economic espionage game - it\u2019s without a doubt China. If you\u2019ve watched this channel, you know that China\u2019s long term goal is to surpass the US as the world\u2019s greatest superpower.\n\nPart of that strategy is for China to become the market leader in vital industries like tech, aerospace, ai, energy, medicine, biotech, etc. And to become the market leader in any of these fields, you need to develop cutting-edge technology. Which is why China been involved in corporate espionage case after corporate espionage case.\n\nDoes the US and other countries spy on foreign businesses? Yes!\nBut there\u2019s no denying that China is the undisputed master at this.\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
