avoid catching the virus indoors\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53917432\n\nIf it's stuffy, walk away\n\nDr. David Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers\n\nIf you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. \n\nYou're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected.\n\nLook up at the air conditioning\n\nSplit air conditioner\n\nIf there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any\n\nOne person infects 9 in China\n\nAsk about the 'fresh air ratio'\n\nProf Cath Noakes, Leeds, Environmental panel, SAGE\n\nHaving 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing\n\nThe more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building\n\nGet the office management to check if there's virus in the filters\n\nIs there someone shedding in the building?\n\nSouth Korea, 11th floor, one person infects 90\n\nWatch out for draughts\nAn infected person sitting by an open window or ventilation source\nDownwind effect\nDilution effect outweighs the risk\nViral dilution\n\nIf you would like to donate to this educational project, please use the following link, thank you,

U\u011fur \u015eahin (immunologist)\n\nFounder of the firm\n\nNo serious side effects\n\nWe did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study\n\nKey side

prevent viral transmission?\n\nI'm very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine\n\nmaybe not 90% but maybe 50%\n\nbut we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread\n\nHow long will immunity last?\nAntibody response in patients, will decline over time\nBooster immunisation should not be too
