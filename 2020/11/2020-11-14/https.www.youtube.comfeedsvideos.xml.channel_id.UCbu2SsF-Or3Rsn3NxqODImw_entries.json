Does Valhalla build upon the franchise\u2019s new formula, introduced in Origins and honed by Odyssey, or does it give fans a different experience.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is the latest game in Ubisoft's open-world series, and it continues the franchise\u2019s new RPG formula from the Ancient Greece-set predecessor, Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey. But how does Valhalla compare to Odyssey?\u00a0\n\nIn the video above, Jordan Ram\u00e9e and Lucy James compare the two games across three topics: gameplay, world and setting, and story and characters. From a gameplay standpoint, Valhalla streamlines many of Odyssey\u2019s loot-heavy mechanics, while returning the series to its roots by bringing back elements such as social stealth and the hidden blade.\u00a0\n\nLucy and Jordan also break down the two games' settings: Viking-era England, and Ancient Greece, and discuss which title best represents its historical location. And finally, they discuss Valhalla and Odyssey\u2019s central protagonists, comparing fan-favourite Kassandra with the new assassin on the block, Eivor.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1l-EYUPIew", "date_published": "2020-11-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ray Tracing Explained For PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC", "description": "PC gamers have been able to play with it for a little while, but ray tracing has finally come to consoles with the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. But what exactly is ray tracing and should you really care about it?\n\nRay tracing has been around for PC gamers for some time, but with the power behind the Xbox Series X|S and the PS5, it\u2019s now an option for console gamers too. But what exactly is ray tracing?\n\nIn the video above, we walk you through the basics of the tech that's on everyone's minds right now. In simple terms, ray tracing casts out and calculates linear rays of light between in-game light sources and the player\u2019s eye. It's used to simulate realistic reflections, refractions, and shadows, which can create a more immersive and photorealistic gaming experience, but at the sacrifice of your game\u2019s frame rate. We discuss the use of ray tracing in recent games such as Watch Dogs: Legion, which has come under fire for how it's handled the lighting system.\u00a0\n\nGames that currently have plans to introduce ray tracing on console systems include Halo Infinite, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, NBA 2K21, Devil May Cry Special Edition on Xbox Series X/S, and Demon\u2019s Souls Remastered.

Let's take a look at each one. \n\nMAJOR SPOLIERS AHEAD!\u00a0\u00a0\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has a few endings to its single-player\u00a0campaign mode. Players are given the option to save the world by preventing a nuclear war, or teaming up with Perseus to commence the launch and deter the Americans to a dead end.\u00a0Throughout the story,\u00a0you\u2019re given many options\u00a0to progress the way you want. But when it comes to this final mission, a lot more is at stake and your actions\u00a0are a matter of life or death. Here\u2019s how your options break down.\u00a0\n\nAfter some mental interrogation, your character Bell wakes up and finds themselves with Adler and the American team. You\u2019re\u00a0strapped to a chair and given one choice:\u00a0Tell Adler the truth about Perseus\u2019 location and help prevent a nuclear catastrophe, or lie to him, divert the American team to another location, and help Perseus\u00a0vaporize all of Europe. If you tell Adler the truth, you get the canonical ending where you, Mason, Woods, and Adler head to the\u00a0Solovetsky\u00a0islands and\u00a0stop the launch from happening. Perseus escapes but America wins this fight and saves all of Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nLying to Adler sends you to the Duga array in the Ukraine- a distraction for Perseus to start the\u00a0launch\u00a0with\u00a0no Americans in his way.\u00a0If you unlocked the secret door in Hudson\u2019s\u00a0base\u00a0prior to this mission, you also have a chance to not only turn your back on the US team, but plan an ambush that leads to the deaths of Woods, Mason, Kim and Adler by your own hands. Once the US team is killed, you and the mysterious man (who turns out NOT to be Perseus) launch the nukes and blame the United States.\u00a0Be on the lookout for\u00a0GameSpot\u2019s\u00a0Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War coverage with its\u00a0upcoming review and guides to both multiplayer and\u00a0zombies\u00a0mode.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhQeqWQ8ppQ", "date_published": "2020-11-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5's DualSense Is Revolutionary For First Person Shooters", "description": "Jean-Luc talks about how the PlayStation 5's new DualSense controller is a massive game changer for first-person shooters after experiencing it with Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2D3O8sMayQ", "date_published": "2020-11-14 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
