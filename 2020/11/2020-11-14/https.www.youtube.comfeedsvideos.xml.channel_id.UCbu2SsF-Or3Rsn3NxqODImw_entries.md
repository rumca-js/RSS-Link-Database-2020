Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Odyssey: both in the same franchise, but two very different games. Does Valhalla build upon the franchise’s new formula, introduced in Origins and honed by Odyssey, or does it give fans a different experience.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the latest game in Ubisoft's open-world series, and it continues the franchise’s new RPG formula from the Ancient Greece-set predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. But how does Valhalla compare to Odyssey? 

In the video above, Jordan Ramée and Lucy James compare the two games across three topics: gameplay, world and setting, and story and characters. From a gameplay standpoint, Valhalla streamlines many of Odyssey’s loot-heavy mechanics, while returning the series to its roots by bringing back elements such as social stealth and the hidden blade. 

Lucy and Jordan also break down the two games' settings: Viking-era England, and Ancient Greece, and discuss which title best represents its historical location. And finally, they discuss Valhalla and Odyssey’s central protagonists, comparing fan-favourite Kassandra with the new assassin on the block, Eivor.

PC gamers have been able to play with it for a little while, but ray tracing has finally come to consoles with the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. But what exactly is ray tracing and should you really care about it?

Ray tracing has been around for PC gamers for some time, but with the power behind the Xbox Series X|S and the PS5, it’s now an option for console gamers too. But what exactly is ray tracing?

In the video above, we walk you through the basics of the tech that's on everyone's minds right now. In simple terms, ray tracing casts out and calculates linear rays of light between in-game light sources and the player’s eye. It's used to simulate realistic reflections, refractions, and shadows, which can create a more immersive and photorealistic gaming experience, but at the sacrifice of your game’s frame rate. We discuss the use of ray tracing in recent games such as Watch Dogs: Legion, which has come under fire for how it's handled the lighting system. 

Games that currently have plans to introduce ray tracing on console systems include Halo Infinite, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, NBA 2K21, Devil May Cry Special Edition on Xbox Series X/S, and Demon’s Souls Remastered. For more on these games, keep your eyes peeled to GameSpot.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has multiple ending scenarios for its single-player campaign. Let's take a look at each one. 

MAJOR SPOLIERS AHEAD!  
Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War has a few endings to its single-player campaign mode. Players are given the option to save the world by preventing a nuclear war, or teaming up with Perseus to commence the launch and deter the Americans to a dead end. Throughout the story, you’re given many options to progress the way you want. But when it comes to this final mission, a lot more is at stake and your actions are a matter of life or death. Here’s how your options break down. 

After some mental interrogation, your character Bell wakes up and finds themselves with Adler and the American team. You’re strapped to a chair and given one choice: Tell Adler the truth about Perseus’ location and help prevent a nuclear catastrophe, or lie to him, divert the American team to another location, and help Perseus vaporize all of Europe. If you tell Adler the truth, you get the canonical ending where you, Mason, Woods, and Adler head to the Solovetsky islands and stop the launch from happening. Perseus escapes but America wins this fight and saves all of Europe.  

Lying to Adler sends you to the Duga array in the Ukraine- a distraction for Perseus to start the launch with no Americans in his way. If you unlocked the secret door in Hudson’s base prior to this mission, you also have a chance to not only turn your back on the US team, but plan an ambush that leads to the deaths of Woods, Mason, Kim and Adler by your own hands. Once the US team is killed, you and the mysterious man (who turns out NOT to be Perseus) launch the nukes and blame the United States. Be on the lookout for GameSpot’s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War coverage with its upcoming review and guides to both multiplayer and zombies mode.
