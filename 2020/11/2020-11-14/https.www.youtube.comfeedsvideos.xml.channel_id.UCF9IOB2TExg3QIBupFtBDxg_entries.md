Hands, Face, Space, Ventilate

Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53917432

If it's stuffy, walk away

Dr. David Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers

If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. 

You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected.

Look up at the air conditioning

Split air conditioner

If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any

One person infects 9 in China

Ask about the 'fresh air ratio'

Prof Cath Noakes, Leeds, Environmental panel, SAGE

Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing

The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building

Get the office management to check if there's virus in the filters

Is there someone shedding in the building?

South Korea, 11th floor, one person infects 90

Watch out for draughts
An infected person sitting by an open window or ventilation source
Downwind effect
Dilution effect outweighs the risk
Viral dilution

Pfizer / BioNTech n RNA vaccine

UK, 10 million does this year, 30 million more ordered

Two doses, 3 weeks apart

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54949799

Professor Uğur Şahin (immunologist)

Founder of the firm

No serious side effects

We did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study

Key side effects

Pain in the injection site for a few days

Some participants, mild to moderate fever for one or two days

We did not see any other serious side-effects which would result in the pausing or halting of the study

So far, the safety profile seems to be absolutely benign

The next few months

This winter will be hard

We will not have a big impact on infection numbers

300 million doses by April 2021

This will start the impact

Biggest effect summer 2021

Must have a high vaccination rate by autumn / winter 2021

Normal winter next year

Will the vaccine prevent viral transmission?

I'm very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine

maybe not 90% but maybe 50%

but we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread

How long will immunity last?
Antibody response in patients, will decline over time
Booster immunisation should not be too complicated
