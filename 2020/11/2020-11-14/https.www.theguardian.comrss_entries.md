His 2017 debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/feb/17/this-is-memorial-device-david-keenan-review">This Is Memorial Device</a></em>, was shortlisted for the Gordon Burn prize, which he won last year with his second novel, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/06/for-the-good-times-david-keenan-review">For the Good Times</a></em>, about the IRA. He has also published a history of the UK’s industrial music scene, <em>England’s Hidden Reverse</em>, and a book about tarot, <em>To Run Wild in It</em>, accompanied by his own deck of cards, created in collaboration with the artist Sophy Hollington. His new novel, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/xstabeth-9781474617055.html">Xstabeth</a></em>, follows the 19-year-old daughter of a Russian singer-songwriter visited by an otherworldly force.</p><p><strong>You have said that you wrote </strong><em><strong>Xstabeth </strong></em><strong>in “a state of possession”.<br /></strong>I’m not sitting down and preconceiving books any more. I always knew my first book would be about the excitement of the post-punk years in Airdrie, to go against the perception of small towns being depressing. And I also had an idea in mind in <em>For the Good Times</em>, because of my father and his family, who grew up in the Ardoyne during the Troubles. <em>Xstabeth </em>is deeper waters - it was like receiving a signal. I’m not 100% sure what’s going on in it myself, which is what I totally love. I no longer want a book with a point because once you’ve taken that point on board that book is solved and I don’t want art that can be solved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/14/david-keenan-i-no-longer-want-a-book-with-a-point">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Conservatives are doing their level best to weaken the power of the Electoral Commission</p><p>The corruption of the American right is seen at its most decadent in the disenfranchisement of black and poor citizens and the refusal to accept defeat when voter suppression fails. If you think it could not happen here, consider the fate of Britain’s “independent” Electoral Commission that once kept politics clean.</p><p>The Conservatives are in the process of either neutering or abolishing it. They are bringing voter suppression to the UK and making it clear to anyone who takes notice that the right, with its overwhelming financial advantages, wants minimal controls of big money and the political propaganda it buys. Few take notice. The corruption of politics is the strangest thing: an unnoticed outrage. It’s not that it’s an official secret. It’s just that few seem to care. One day, we’ll look back at today’s obscure manoeuvres in esoteric committees and ask why more did not protest when protesting might have made a difference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/14/the-us-right-is-skilled-in-voter-suppression-and-the-tories-are-learning-fast">Continue reading...</a>

Why does he need to dredge up the tired myth that comedy’s a male thing?<p>Why do unfunny men never stop going on about unfunny women? This time, it was the former TV chat show host Michael Parkinson. Disagreeing about men finding it difficult to express their emotions, he said that most men he knew were sensitive and funny: “It’s a very contentious statement, but they’re much better than women in their sense of humour.” He went on to grumble about his comments getting him into trouble. You can’t say anything these days, can you? Especially when it’s demonstrable codswallop.</p><p>Let’s deal with this in the fragrant ladylike way that women are really good at. Parkinson is entitled to conclude that one sex is “much better” at humour. It’s his business – and no reflection at all on his archaic attitudes – if he managed to sit in front of innumerable female guests and find none of them particularly amusing. Nor is it Parky’s fault if he’s unable to recall the countless delusional male bores gassing away on his show, because, let’s face it, not all of them were Muhammad Ali.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/14/is-michael-parkinson-having-a-laugh-when-he-says-men-are-funnier-than-women">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How small tasks can benefit our state of mind</p><p>For Anna McGovern there is a satisfying, sensory pleasure to be had in rinsing milk bottles: “The very best thing about getting your milk delivered is ‘rinsing and returning’. Don’t cheat by putting your bottles in the dishwasher. Wash them, by hand. Put a small amount of water in the bottle, slosh the water around, put your hand over the top, shake it up and down, upturn the bottle, glugging the water out, then head for your doorstep and put out the bottle with a ‘plink’”.</p><p>This is one of many meandering, seemingly mundane tasks that McGovern delights in describing in her new book. Another is pegging out the washing (“Pull it out of the basket in a long, sweet-smelling, damp lump.”) In fact, when we speak about pottering, McGovern tells me she has done just that to “help order her thoughts”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/14/when-rearranging-a-drawer-is-restful-the-magic-of-pottering">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Verve)<br />The late veteran’s final album offers 15 gentle takes on old melodies and Brubeck originals</p><p><a href="https://www.davebrubeck.com/">Dave Brubeck</a> is famous for his 1961 megahit Take Five (composed by his saxophonist, Paul Desmond), and catchy numbers in odd time signatures such as Blue Rondo à la Turk. In those days, jazz critics tended to be a little sniffy about Brubeck’s heavy-handed piano style. In later life, however, he made some beautifully simple solo albums, such as <em>One Alone </em>and <em>Private Brubeck Remembers</em>. </p><p><a href="https://davebrubeck.lnk.to/lullabiesWE">This one</a> follows in a similar manner. It’s his last studio recording, made in 2010, two years before his death, and released now in time for his centenary next month. The programme is a mixture of old melodies and new Brubeck compositions. The former range from the Brahms Lullaby to Louis Armstrong’s signature tune, When It’s Sleepy Time Down South, each being treated to a little gentle harmonic rearrangement. The five originals are pleasant, light music. Briar Bush is a really strong tune waiting for a lyric, and Koto Song is based on the pentatonic scale, giving it a Japanese flavour. The average length of each of the 15 tracks is about three minutes. It’s all very mild, as the title suggests, but it’s genial and well made.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/14/dave-brubeck-lullabies-review">Continue reading...</a>

Pfizer was first with the news, but biotech firms, governments, banks and NGOs are all involved in the search for a jab to prevent coronavirus infection<p>The leading candidate to become the world’s first Covid-19 vaccine, developed by the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech, had its genesis in late January 2020. Uğur Şahin, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/10/ugur-sahin-and-ozlem-tureci-german-dream-team-behind-vaccine" title="">chief executive of the Mainz-based biotech, read about coronavirus in the </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/10/ugur-sahin-and-ozlem-tureci-german-dream-team-behind-vaccine" title="">Lancet</a></em> and worried that the outbreak could grow into a pandemic.</p><p>Şahin summoned colleagues to tell them that the company would shift its focus from cancer treatments to finding a vaccine for the deadly virus. It would use a method based on mRNA, whereby a stretch of genetic material from the coronavirus is injected into the body, resulting in human cells producing its so-called spike protein. This in turn triggers an immune response. Pfizer stepped in to help with development and distribution costs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/14/covid-10-vaccine-speedy-work-development-pfizer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Given the problems involved in regulating the tech giants, the EU commission’s targeted investigation seems the smartest way to achieve results </p><p>The European commission has opened an <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/european-commission-says-amazon-breached-antitrust-rules-opens-second-formal-investigation">antitrust investigation</a> of Amazon, on the grounds that the company has breached EU antitrust rules against distorting competition in online retail markets. Amazon, says the commission, has been using its privileged access to non-public data of independent sellers who sell on its marketplace to benefit the parts of its own retail business that directly compete with those third-party sellers. The commission has also opened a second investigation into the possible preferential treatment of Amazon’s own retail offers compared with those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon’s logistics and delivery services.</p><p>The good news about this is not so much that the EU is taking action as that it is doing so in an intelligently targeted manner. Too much of the discourse about tech companies in the last two years has been about “breaking them up”. But “break ’em up” is a slogan, not a policy, and it has a kind of Trumpian ring to it. The commission is avoiding that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/14/when-it-comes-to-amazon-breaking-up-is-hard-to-do">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For a demonstration of a woman who is unafraid to speak with confidence, look no further than Harris’s victory speech</p><p>Every few months on social media, a campaign reliably comes around urging women to stop undermining ourselves at work. Don’t, we’re advised, use the qualifier “just”, as in “can I just float an idea?” Stop apologising for making routine demands or having the temerity to use up someone’s time. Most recently and trenchantly, don’t, we are advised, ground every timorous request with the phrase “no worries if not”.</p><p>I say and do all of these things, although less frequently than I once did. Where 10 years ago the qualifiers came out as reflex, these days, I generally catch and delete them before I hit send. I don’t open emails with “sorry to bother you”, unless I’m being deliberately passive aggressive. (This is my preferred tonal mode, obviously, although it gets me nowhere in the US. A snippy email I sent to an American last week hinged on the word “unideal”, a neutral term to American ears, but to a Brit, clearly, signifying a curse on you and your family for a thousand years.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/14/kamala-harris-vice-president-woman-speak-with-confidence">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Thought up by a tired new mother, and now backed by Bill Gates, manufactured human milk sounds like the stuff of science fiction. But just how liberating will it be?</p><p>Dr Leila Strickland became a mother when she was a few months away from completing her postdoctorate fellowship in cell biology at Stanford University. She spent the first three months of her son’s life “at home on maternity leave, relentlessly struggling to breastfeed. I was having a hard time producing enough milk.” She never expected to find feeding her baby a greater challenge than advanced cytology.</p><p>“My mom breastfed me and my sister until we were over two years old. All my life, I’d fully embraced the proposition that breast milk is the best nutrition for a baby, and that this is what I would feed <em>my</em> baby.” Lactation consultants, paediatricians and well-meaning friends told her to just keep trying. “Because I was so unprepared for it, I found it really isolating. I felt like there was something wrong with me.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/14/i-want-to-give-my-child-the-best-the-race-to-grow-human-breast-milk-in-a-lab">Continue reading...</a>
