I'm often asked the question, what was rock bottom for me, what was the moment that made me quit drinking and taking dr*gs? Here I'll tell you a few of the stories and moments that led to me going into seek treatment for my addictions and enter into recovery. Please be aware, don't judge your addictions or destructive behaviours to some of these more extreme examples. It doesn't have to be overtly "extreme" to warrant addressing - a lot of addictions and unhealthy habits take a more insidious form, and often last longer because of that.
