Two years ago this week, singer-songwriter Ty Segall visited our studio to play a solo acoustic session. Watch that three-song set.

Segall's 2018 album, "Freedom's Goblin," is a largely electric guitar and drum-driven effort … which raises the question why Segall embarked on a solo acoustic tour the same year of its release. "It's really scary and really challenging," Segall explained. "I'm kind of obsessed with trying to do stuff that either I shouldn't do or that's hard for me or that's frightening or just super fun."

SONGS PERFORMED
0:00 "Alta"
3:47 "Crazy"
6:11 "My Lady's On Fire"

PERSONNEL
Ty Segall – guitar and vocals
