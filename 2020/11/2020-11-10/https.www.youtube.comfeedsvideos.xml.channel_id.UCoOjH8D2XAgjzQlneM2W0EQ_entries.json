Basically, it\u2019s the CIA\u2019s secret military. The idea of this game is to shine a light on how both sides of the Cold War got their hands dirty. But how much of this is true? And how much of Black Ops Cold War is pure fiction?\n\nOn August 6th 1945, the US dropped the \"Little Boy\" over Hiroshima. Three days later, humanity witnessed the second \"Fat Man\" over Nagasaki.\n\nIn 1949, the Soviet Union which is America\u2019s new enemy, conducted its first test - code-named 'RDS-1' which looked similar to America\u2019s Fat Man. That\u2019s where the Venona Project came to the rescue. A counterintelligence operation created to intercept and decrypt messages from the Soviet Union\u2019s intelligence agencies. \n\nOne year after that first Soviet test, the Venona Project pointed to an atomic spy named Klaus Fuchs who was eventually arrested that led to the arrest of atomic spy David Greenglass who would then help convict his sister and brother in-law: two Soviet spies named Ethel and Julius Rosenberg.\n\nAnother unidentified spy at Los Alamos that went by the code name PERS - or Perseus. But when the Venona decryptions were released in 1995, it became clear that Perseus was a mere disinformation campaign to hide the real atomic spy that was active at the time - Theodore Hall. \n\nOne of the more unexpected locations in Black Ops Cold War is Miami. Castro took over Cuba in 1959. A year after Castro took power, the CIA made it its job to off him and overthrow the Communist government, codename Operation Mongoose. They built a new CIA station out in Miami, code-named JMWAVE.\n\nAnother prominent location the game showed off was Angola. Angola became what you can call a surrogate battleground, or a proxy war between the US and the Soviets.\n\nAnother location that I didn\u2019t know much about was the Ural Mountains. This area became the center of the Soviet\u2019s nuclear weapons effort.\n\nOne of the more prominent missions shown off was the one located in Turkey. It made for a great spot to launch CIA operations against the Soviets.\n\nSo how much truth is there in Black Ops Cold War? Well, it\u2019s like movies that are based on true events. \n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
