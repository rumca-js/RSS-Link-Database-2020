## PASS: a Password Manager & Two Factor Authentication (OTP) with no Cell Phone

Usually I just remember my passwords, but the program pass is very nice for storing many passwords, calling them in scripts, inserting them from a dmenu prompt and more. Crucially, with the pass-otp module, it can also do Two Factor Authentication (2FA/TFA) AKA One Time Passwords (OTP) where you use a 6-digit-password that changes every half a minute or so. Usually, normies use a cell phone for this, but you can actually just have pass do it on your computer. I actually have a dmenu prompt that gives me a list of all my OTPs to insert, and it automatically generates the six-digit password.
Pass will be in your distro's package repository, but here's the site.

pass-otp is probably also in your repository, but here is the Github:
https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp
Note that I also use the program zbarimg to convert a QR code into text that we can feed into pass-otp. It will be in your distro's package repo too.

Pass uses GPG to encrypt and decrypt your passwords, so I also talk about making a GPG key pair. You can have your GPG unlock automatically on login with pam-gnupg:

## Are Your Passwords Safe with Google? How do passwords really work?

I want to clear up some misconceptions about how passwords can be stored for secure purposes. Specifically, it is very possible to *not* store a password, yet still be able to test user credentials when they attempt to log on. Dumb systems store either plaintext or encrypted passwords, while more secure systems never store passwords, but only password *hashes* and hopefully with randomly generated salt. I explain what that all means in this video. I guess you also learn hacking techniques by proxy in this video.

When it comes down to it, you never can be fully sure if web services are actually doing user credentials in a secure way. Always be safe when using different services and use different passwords.
