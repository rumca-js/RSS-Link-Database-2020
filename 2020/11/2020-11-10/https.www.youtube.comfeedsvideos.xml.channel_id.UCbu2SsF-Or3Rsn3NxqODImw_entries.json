You'll see us fight against dangerous soldiers, avoid traps, and guard our precious souls as we attempt to move forward without getting killed. The game is running in performance mode at 60 frames per second on the PS5.\nThis version of Demon's Souls is a PS5 exclusive, having originally released more than a decade ago exclusively for PS3. The game's structure and enemies remain unchanged, but its visuals were rebuilt from the ground up to take full advantage of the PS5's hardware.

Check out this comparison of Days Gone, running on PS4 Pro and PS5 with the latest patches.\n\nWith the release of the PlayStation 5, certain PS4 games will be getting a boost, so\u00a0we\u2019re playing through\u00a0several PS4 games on PS5 to see how Sony\u2019s next-gen console improves the performance or experience of\u00a0current-gen games.\u00a0\nIn the video above, we show off Days Gone. We first played the game on PS4 Pro and then played it on PS5\u2014in both instances, focusing on the first 30 minutes of the campaign.\u00a0As you can see,\u00a0Days Gone plays at a much smother frame rate\u00a0on PS5, which is especially\u00a0noticeable\u00a0when zooming through\u00a0its\u00a0zombie-infested world while on motorcycle.\u00a0\u00a0\nThere are other, less noticeable differences as well. For instance, Days Gone features less pop-in textures on PS5,\u00a0and the game loads a whole lot faster on next-gen, too.\u00a0If you\u2019re thinking about picking up Days Gone, it appears you\u2019ll have a much smoother experience on PS5 in comparison to PS4.\u00a0\nIn\u00a0GameSpot\u2019s\u00a0Days Gone review, Kallie Plagge writes, \u201cI did a lot of things in Days Gone. I burned every single\u00a0Freaker\u00a0nest; I cleared every ambush camp; I maxed out my bike; I took out a few optional hordes just because. Like Deacon with Sarah, I kept going because I hoped to find something, to follow a thread to a possibly fascinating or satisfying or impactful conclusion. But at the end of it all, I'd only gotten scraps.\u201d\u00a0\n\n00:00 - Opening\n01:22 - Loading Times Comparison\n02:27 - Cutscene Comparison\n03:28 - Gameplay Comparison", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evNC-a_r36g", "date_published": "2020-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5 Spider-Man Remastered vs PS4 Pro", "description": "Take a look at Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered running on PS5 in Fidelity Mode compared to Marvel's Spider-Man (2018) running on a PlayStation 4 Pro.\u00a0\n\nOne of the PlayStation 4's most beloved games, Marvel's Spider-Man has received a face lift (quite literally) for Sony's brand-new PlayStation 5, so we compared it to a version of the game running on PlayStation 4 Pro.\n\nMarvel's Spider-Man Remastered for PlayStation 5 is able to be played in two modes. In Performance Mode, the game runs at 60fps, but doesn't have all the bells and whistles afforded to the next generation, such as ray tracing. In Fidelity Mode, the game is locked at 30fps, but has lighting enhancements, ray tracing, and additional visual effects. We compared the PS5 version's Fidelity Mode to the PlayStation 4 Pro version of the game, which runs at 30fps in an upscaled 4K resolution.\u00a0\n\nWe also show some more footage of Peter Parker's new face, so you can compare it to the old one, and judge which you prefer.

The Xbox One had a tumultuous launch and presented itself as something other than what its fans wanted. However, fast-forward to today and, as a brand, Xbox is the healthiest it has been in many years. This it thanks to a realigning of strategies that places people that play video games at the center and, at the same time, moves Xbox in bold new directions.\n\nUnder the leadership of Phil Spencer, Xbox has pioneered Game Pass, a Netflix-like subscription service that offers a large library of games for a relatively low subscription fee. It has expanded this service to PC, and also launched a cloud gaming service in xCloud.\nFurthermore, the platform holder took big step to improve accessibility, and made meaningful changes to the Xbox One experience to improve it for Xbox One X. This, altogether, has allowed Xbox to turn a stumble into a steady jog towards success\nAhead of the launch of the Xbox Series X and Series S, we spoke to Spencer about the identity of Xbox, the state of Halo, and the future of Xbox as he sees it.\n\n01:08 - Identity of Xbox\n03:05 - Charting The Future\n04:48 - Killer Apps\n07:21 - First-Party Timeline\n09:39 - The State Of Halo\n17:59 - Diversity Of Genres\n20:34 - Japan And The Asian Market\n28:27 - Elden Ring Update\n29:33 - 1vs100\n30:36 - No Gimmicks", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0duvlbro4Gk", "date_published": "2020-11-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Series X vs Series S: Features Comparison", "description": "Let\u2019s help you break down price, performance, and other key differences to consider when buying a next-gen Xbox console.\n\nMicrosoft's Xbox Series S and Series X are shaping up to be promising next-gen game consoles. If you\u2019re looking at buying one there are big differences to consider. In this video we take a look at what you\u2019re getting for the price either buying outright or through Game Pass Ultimate. We\u2019re going to look at how backwards compatible games can be loaded onto each console, differences in performance and power, physical size, hard drive space, and clever ways the S is trying to compete with the X. Both consoles can be bought outright or paid off over two years with Game Pass Ultimate that includes a rotating list of titles, EA Play, more upcoming games will be added such as Halo Infinite and Bethesda's lineup. \n\nThe Series X comes with the most power, 4k native resolution, a 1 TB NVMe Solid State Drive, and a disc drive. The Series S upscales from 1440p to 4k, has a 512 GB hard drive, and aims to make game sizes around 30% smaller on average. The Series S is also 60% physically smaller. \n\nXbox consoles release on November 10th with waves of pre-orders becoming available.
