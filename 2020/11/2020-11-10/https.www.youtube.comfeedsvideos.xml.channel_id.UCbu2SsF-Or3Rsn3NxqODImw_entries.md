We load in from the Nexus into the Gates of Boletaria. Get a glimpse of 15 minutes of Demon's Souls on the PlayStation 5. 

In this clip from an early section of the Demon's Souls remake, we head through the Gates of Boletaria to see what Bluepoint's game has to offer. You'll see us fight against dangerous soldiers, avoid traps, and guard our precious souls as we attempt to move forward without getting killed. The game is running in performance mode at 60 frames per second on the PS5.
This version of Demon's Souls is a PS5 exclusive, having originally released more than a decade ago exclusively for PS3. The game's structure and enemies remain unchanged, but its visuals were rebuilt from the ground up to take full advantage of the PS5's hardware. It releases alongside the system on November 12.

## PS4 Pro vs PS5: Days Gone

Want to know how much of a difference a PS5's optimization patch adds to your PS4 games? Check out this comparison of Days Gone, running on PS4 Pro and PS5 with the latest patches.

With the release of the PlayStation 5, certain PS4 games will be getting a boost, so we’re playing through several PS4 games on PS5 to see how Sony’s next-gen console improves the performance or experience of current-gen games. 
In the video above, we show off Days Gone. We first played the game on PS4 Pro and then played it on PS5—in both instances, focusing on the first 30 minutes of the campaign. As you can see, Days Gone plays at a much smother frame rate on PS5, which is especially noticeable when zooming through its zombie-infested world while on motorcycle.  
There are other, less noticeable differences as well. For instance, Days Gone features less pop-in textures on PS5, and the game loads a whole lot faster on next-gen, too. If you’re thinking about picking up Days Gone, it appears you’ll have a much smoother experience on PS5 in comparison to PS4. 
In GameSpot’s Days Gone review, Kallie Plagge writes, “I did a lot of things in Days Gone. I burned every single Freaker nest; I cleared every ambush camp; I maxed out my bike; I took out a few optional hordes just because. Like Deacon with Sarah, I kept going because I hoped to find something, to follow a thread to a possibly fascinating or satisfying or impactful conclusion. But at the end of it all, I'd only gotten scraps.”

Take a look at Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered running on PS5 in Fidelity Mode compared to Marvel's Spider-Man (2018) running on a PlayStation 4 Pro. 

One of the PlayStation 4's most beloved games, Marvel's Spider-Man has received a face lift (quite literally) for Sony's brand-new PlayStation 5, so we compared it to a version of the game running on PlayStation 4 Pro.

Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered for PlayStation 5 is able to be played in two modes. In Performance Mode, the game runs at 60fps, but doesn't have all the bells and whistles afforded to the next generation, such as ray tracing. In Fidelity Mode, the game is locked at 30fps, but has lighting enhancements, ray tracing, and additional visual effects. We compared the PS5 version's Fidelity Mode to the PlayStation 4 Pro version of the game, which runs at 30fps in an upscaled 4K resolution. 

We also show some more footage of Peter Parker's new face, so you can compare it to the old one, and judge which you prefer. Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales' Ultimate Edition includes Spider-Man Remastered. You can buy the game separately, or upgrade your PS4 version.

At this point, you know how the story goes. The Xbox One had a tumultuous launch and presented itself as something other than what its fans wanted. However, fast-forward to today and, as a brand, Xbox is the healthiest it has been in many years. This it thanks to a realigning of strategies that places people that play video games at the center and, at the same time, moves Xbox in bold new directions.

Under the leadership of Phil Spencer, Xbox has pioneered Game Pass, a Netflix-like subscription service that offers a large library of games for a relatively low subscription fee. It has expanded this service to PC, and also launched a cloud gaming service in xCloud.
Furthermore, the platform holder took big step to improve accessibility, and made meaningful changes to the Xbox One experience to improve it for Xbox One X. This, altogether, has allowed Xbox to turn a stumble into a steady jog towards success
Ahead of the launch of the Xbox Series X and Series S, we spoke to Spencer about the identity of Xbox, the state of Halo, and the future of Xbox as he sees it.

Let’s help you break down price, performance, and other key differences to consider when buying a next-gen Xbox console.

Microsoft's Xbox Series S and Series X are shaping up to be promising next-gen game consoles. If you’re looking at buying one there are big differences to consider. In this video we take a look at what you’re getting for the price either buying outright or through Game Pass Ultimate. We’re going to look at how backwards compatible games can be loaded onto each console, differences in performance and power, physical size, hard drive space, and clever ways the S is trying to compete with the X. Both consoles can be bought outright or paid off over two years with Game Pass Ultimate that includes a rotating list of titles, EA Play, more upcoming games will be added such as Halo Infinite and Bethesda's lineup. 

The Series X comes with the most power, 4k native resolution, a 1 TB NVMe Solid State Drive, and a disc drive. The Series S upscales from 1440p to 4k, has a 512 GB hard drive, and aims to make game sizes around 30% smaller on average. The Series S is also 60% physically smaller. 

Xbox consoles release on November 10th with waves of pre-orders becoming available. GameSpot has an Xbox Series X and are currently running it through its paces. Head over to GameSpot to see our preview, new faster load times, and how 4k footage looks.

See the performance, visuals, and load times of Assassin's Creed Valhalla compared between the Xbox Series X and Xbox One X.

Assassin's Creed Valhalla is the latest game in Ubisoft's open-world series, and it's available on a wide range of platforms, spanning current and next gen. But what kind of improvements can you expect to see if you play it on Xbox Series X vs. Xbox One X? 

The video above demonstrates some of the benefits of upgrading to the next-gen version--which you'll get access to for free by purchasing the Xbox One version (the same is true with the PS4 and PS5 versions). We start out by showcasing the improved visuals, including the impressive lighting and shadow effects you'll enjoy on Series X. From there, we take a look at load times, specifically as we fast travel to England. On Series X, this takes 17 seconds, whereas the same task takes more than four times as long to complete on Xbox One.

You can watch the video for much more on what to expect between the two versions, and be sure to check out GameSpot for our full Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and much more next-gen coverage.
