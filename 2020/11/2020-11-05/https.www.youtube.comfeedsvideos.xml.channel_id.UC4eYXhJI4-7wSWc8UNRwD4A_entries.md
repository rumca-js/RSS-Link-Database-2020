In partnership with The National Museum of African American History and Culture, join NPR Music for an engaging conversation highlighting African American women who have played a pivotal part in the rock and roll genre. Although African American women have influenced rock and roll, their presence in the genre has been diminished in favor of narratives of rock being dominated by White men. Journalist, cofounder and driving force behind NPR Music's Turning The Tables series Ann Powers will interview Maureen Mahon, author of Black Diamond Queens, to discuss how African American women have laid the foundation for rock and roll—from chart-topping hits and stage personas. The interview will also highlight recordings, albums, photographs, and other archival materials within the museum’s collections that document African American women’s history in rock and roll between the 1950s to the present. 

This program is produced in partnership with The National Museum of African American History and Culture, and part of the Smithsonian American Women’s History Initiative - #BecauseOfHerStory

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | November 6, 2020
Ascending R&B talent Tiana Major9 welcomes us into her South London home with a band she assembled for her Tiny Desk (home) concert. Tiana gained the music world’s attention in August when Adele took to Instagram to call the song “Same Space?” “absolutely stunning!!” (The post was liked more than 430,000 times.) I was lucky enough to witness a private Tiana showcase in Los Angeles several months earlier, where I was moved by the refined nature of her voice.

She begins her Tiny Desk with an ending of sorts: the devastating “Collide,” written for the final sequence of Lena Waithe’s critically acclaimed film Queen & Slim. Later, she shows off her range and timbre on “Think About You,” a stunning love song that infuses elements of jazz, alternative R&B and her Jamaican roots. The sweetness in its refrain “I need more hours in the day … just to think about you” feels like a blueprint for how to spend the third wave of quarantine.

## The Badder, The Better: Bobby Shmurda (Pt 1) | Louder Than A Riot, S1E6

Just like his legendary disappearing hat, Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda's career was on the rise in 2014. But so was the evidence in a murder case against his crew, GS9. In the first of three episodes exploring Bobby's story, we look at his come-up through the eyes of former Epic Records exec Sha Money XL, who guided Bobby on his tightrope walk from the streets to superstardom. What happens when the industry capitalizes on a criminal persona? And do record execs have the juice to back Bobby up when things get too hot?

WHAT'S "LOUDER THAN A RIOT"?
Rhyme and punishment go hand in hand in America. "Louder Than A Riot" reveals the interconnected rise of hip-hop and mass incarceration. From Bobby Shmurda to Nipsey Hussle, each episode explores an artist's story to examine a different aspect of the criminal justice system that disproportionately impacts Black America. Hosted by NPR Music's Rodney Carmichael and Sidney Madden, this podcast is invested in power from all angles — the power the music industry wields over artists, the power of institutional forces that marginalize communities of color, the power of the prison industrial complex and the power dynamics deep-rooted in the rap game.
