I think it's time to talk about the Linux noobs. Specifically, how much we need them to keep being relevant, and improve. Let's start !

First thing is, everyone that starts using Linux is a noob at some point. The term can be used to imply lack of skill, but basically it means a beginner, a newcomer. So, basically, we need noobs because we need new people to start using Linux.

Why? Because it is important, I think, to promote free software and Linux. It is crucial that people realize that proprietary operating systems are actually hurting their computing experience, and turning them into juicy bits of data to be collected, and sold to advertisers. So the end goal should be to try and get more people to use Linux and open source software, and that means more noobs.

## We need new points of view

It's easy to lose track of what's easy, what's simple, and what's acceptable in a computing experience. I, for one, am not a great judge of what is easy and simple in Linux, because I've been using it on and off since 2006, and full time since 2018. I know the command line, I can script, I know where to find answers, how the system works an generally how components interact with each other. I'm no expert, but I know enough that I can quickly fix a problem.

A noob doesn't, and that's a good thing. the newcomer can give a new outlook on our operating system of choice, or on the software we use everyday. We got used to their quirks, to some amount of issues and the strategies to avoid them. These guys are not, and as such can offer a very valuable critic or opinion on what works for them and what doesn't, and what is an acceptable compromise, and what isn't.

We need these new points of view to improve. Long time users have gotten used to the quirks and don't notice them anymore, and we need the noobs to remind us of them.

## We need to create better documentation and help

Most open source projects already have a pretty good documentation base, but sometimes, it takes the user's technical knowledge for granted. For example, when we post "just type sudo apt install steam" as an answer to someone who wants to install Steam on a debian based distro, we assume multiple things:
- First, that he knows where to type this. A newcome doesn't necessarily know about the terminal, how to open it, or what that command will do exactly.
- Second, that he won't get scared by this. Honestly, the terminal can be a huge turn off for a newcomer. It can be scary to type command lines that you don't understand in a small black window, and hope that it does what you wanted it to do.

This is just not a good experience for someone. Sure, I resort to giving help using the terminal as well. It's more convenient. It's a lot easier to just give a few commands than to create a whole screencast on one distro. The user might use another desktop environment, another theme, and what we show him might not make sense, and might even generate more questions.

This is why we need better documentation, and better online help for beginners, and the only way we're going to do that is if these noobs come up to us and ask us questions that we can answer in a more understandable way.

And explaining these things to beginners might also make us realize what we thought was very easy, isn't.

## Noobs are the future experts

A noob won't stay one for long. Once they start getting to grips with their system, they'll experiment, try other things, and quickly become more of an expert, or at least an experienced user. The noobs are what is going to keep free software and Linux relevant. If we deter them from joining our community, then we basically stagnate until one by one, all projects die by lack of work, help, or usage. We need to bring in fresh blood, constantly, to get new users, new developers, new testers. That's how the open source community works, it's constantly evolving, it's not a fixed element in time. It depends on people, more so than proprietary software created by a company, and as such, it needs new blood, it needs noobs.

## We need to treat our noobs right

Yep. I know, they can be annoying. Asking questions that have already been answered multiple times, not knowing stuff we consider basic, and judging Linux or open source software by comparing it to their experience with proprietary software.
