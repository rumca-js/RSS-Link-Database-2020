But the improvement that'll probably affect your gaming the most is the inclusion of NVMe SSD drives for internal storage in both systems. These solid-state drives help the consoles to decrease load times significantly, both on new games and those made for last generation's consoles. But which of the two next-gen machines loads the fastest?\n\nTo answer that question, we looked to the backwards compatibility features of the PS5 and XSX and let the two machines battle it out head-to-head. We compared the load times of five games originally released on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to see just how fast the two new consoles would get them ready to play, from starting the games to the first moment you can control. Check out the results in the video above; below, you'll find the list of games we compared and timestamps so you can skip straight to their comparisons.\n\n0:40 -Red Dead Redemption 2\n2:00 - Final Fantasy XV\n3:19 - Destiny 2\n4:22 - Monster Hunter World\n5:23 - Batman: Arkham Knight\n\nWe've got lots of PS5 and Xbox Series X coverage with more on the way in the coming days and weeks, so be sure to check it out on GameSpot.com.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRRWsE3s46Q", "date_published": "2020-11-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PlayStation 5 Review", "description": "The PS5 is a promising console that draws a clear line for the next generation, providing an experience that doesn't sacrifice performance for fidelity.\n\nAfter putting the PS5 through its paces and testing out its unique features, including the DualSense controller's improved haptic feedback and resistance, as well as games like Astro's Playroom and Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Mat Paget is impressed with Sony's system and sees it as a great foundation for the next gaming generation.\n\nMat discusses the console's user interface, new controller, 3D audio, performance, and how games make use of the console's exclusive features. He also tested out its SSD to see just how fast it really is for loading games, as well as its accessibility features and new \"Activities.\" He also played PS4 games to see how performance improved on the PS5, and games such as Assassin's Creed Unity now has a much smoother frame rate.\n\nThe console's big new features will rely on third-party developers choosing to utilize them, but the PS5 is a console with plenty of power and a great lineup of exclusive games, both at launch and coming early in 2021.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iep_W7wS9K8", "date_published": "2020-11-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Series S Review", "description": "The Xbox Series S is a cute, compact, and cheaper console that's capable of next-gen experiences, but it comes with some major trade-offs.\n\nIn an unprecedented move for a console launch, two options are available when it comes to new-generation Xbox systems: The powerful and fully equipped Xbox Series X, and the more affordable but somewhat limited Xbox Series S. I've already delivered my review of the Series X, but what does the Series S offer? Well, it's a cute and compact console that'll play previous and next-gen Xbox games, and do so for a relatively cheap entry price of $300 USD.\n\nIt's a sleek system that comes with many of the same great features of the beefier Series X, but it comes with some notable compromises that you'll need to consider if you're interested in this itty-bitty Xbox. And it's not just about the visuals; its limited internal storage space, the nuances to how backwards compatible games look and run, and the lack of a disc drive will influence whether or not this console's for you--the importance of those things depends on your own needs but, either way, the Xbox Series S packs a punch.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jc3XVq128A", "date_published": "2020-11-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Razer Blade Stealth 13 Review: World\u2019s First Gaming Ultrabook?", "description": "Dave\u00a0checks out the \"world's first gaming ultrabook\", the Razer Blade Stealth 13 (Late 2020 Edition).

Backwards compatibility is also a standout feature for the Xbox Series X, including its optimization of previous-gen games, and how it can boost their performance. Most notably, games like Gears 5 can have their frame rates boosted to 120 FPS. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is another game that exemplifies the power of the console\u2019s optimization for past-gen games, increasing its original 30 FPS to a consistent 60 FPS.\n\nWhile the console lacks a strong lineup of launch titles, due in part to the delay of Halo: Infinite, the Xbox Series X is still a confident display of next-generation technology.
