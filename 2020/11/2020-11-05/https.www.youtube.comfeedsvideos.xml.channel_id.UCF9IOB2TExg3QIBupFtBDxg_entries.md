Denmark
5.8 million people
17 million mink

Cull all mink, 207 farms effected, 1,000 farms overall

Mutated form of coronavirus

Transmissible to humans, 12 transfers so far 

Virus may therefore already be in the local human population

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen

Mutated virus posed a risk to the effectiveness of future vaccine

Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, US

UK response

Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announces travellers arriving after 4am on Friday must self-isolate for 14 days

Prof Kåre Mølbak, vaccine expert and director of infectious diseases

State Serum Institute

The worst-case scenario is that we would start off a new pandemic in Denmark 

There’s a risk that this mutated virus is so different from the others that we’d have to put new things in a vaccine

and therefore [the mutation] would slam us all in the whole world back to the start

Dutch virologist and zoonosis expert, Wim van der Poel

more research needed

It seems the mink-variant mutation is found in the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus

but we don’t really know 

Weasels, badgers, otters, ferrets, martens and wolverines

Prof Ian Jones, virologist at the University of Reading

The idea that the virus mutates in a new species is not surprising …

as it must adapt to be able to use mink receptors to enter cells and so will modify the spike protein to enable this to happen efficiently

The danger is that the mutated virus could then spread back into man

and evade any vaccine response which would have been designed to the original, non-mutated version of the spike protein

Risks in pregnancy, CDC, 2nd November

Are pregnant women more at risk from severe COVID-19 compared to non-pregnant women of the same age?

https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6944e3.htm?s_cid=mm6944e3_w

Symptomatic women 15–44 years

Cough
Headache
Muscle aches
Fever
Short of breath
Sore throat
Diarrhoea
Nausea or vomiting
Abdominal pain
Runny nose
Los of taste or smell
Fatigue
Wheezing
Chest pain

Non pregnant women reported more symptoms

Pregnant women reported less symptoms

Laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2

January 22–October 3

Results from diagnosed 1,300,938 women, aged 15 - 44

Pregnancy status available on 409,462 symptomatic women

Among symptomatic women, 23,434 (5.7%) reported to be pregnant

Symptomatic women who were not pregnant, 386,028

After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, and underlying medical conditions

ICU admission in symptomatic women

10.5 versus 3.9 per 1,000 symptomatic COVID cases


Receive invasive ventilation in symptomatic women

2.9 versus 1.1 per 1,000 cases

Receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

0.7 versus 0.3 per 1,000 cases

Death in symptomatic women

Deaths in 23,434 symptomatic pregnant women

34 deaths (1.5 per 1,000 cases)

Deaths in 386,028 symptomatic non -pregnant women

447 deaths (1.2 per 1,000 cases)

Reflecting a 70% increased risk for death associated with pregnancy

Death occurred more often among women aged 35–44 years than among those aged 15–24 years



African American (Black) women

14.1% of women included in this analysis but…

represented 36.6% of overall deaths in symptomatic women aged 15 to 44

26.5% of the deaths among pregnant women

Also increased risk of ICU admission in

Asians

Hawaiian/pacific islanders

Hispanics

Therefore

Seek early medical advice

Prevent infection

Care during medical encounters and 

Annual influenza

Vaccination and prenatal care

Discussion

Although the absolute risks for severe COVID-19–associated outcomes among women were low

pregnant women were at significantly higher risk for severe outcomes compared with nonpregnant women
