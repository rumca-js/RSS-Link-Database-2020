## Linux
A member of the KDE team has published a good article about the transition to Wayland, it's integration with Plasma, and the KwinFT fork that aims to better support wayland in KDE.

Ubuntu 20.10 was released, bringing a fresh GNOME 3.38 desktop, with a bunch of changes: the ability to manually reorder icons in the app grid and in folders, better support for Fingerprint readers, better connection sharing through a QR Code, a new icon theme for LibreOffice to match the Yaru icons.

Pop OS 20.10 was also released, bringing the same enhancements as what Ubuntu 20.10 brought to the table, with a few specific tweaks of their own.

The flurry of distro releases continues, with Fedora 33, also based on GNOME 3.38, for which I have a dedicated video, check it out in the card up top, it has features that Ubuntu didn't use, so it warranted 2 separate videos.

## Open Source

A major piece of open source software is currently dormant: CUPS, the printing system used by most if not all Linux distributions seems dormant.

The Nvidia drivers seem broken with the Linux kernel 5.9, so if you're using an Nvidia card, you're better off waiting a bit before moving to the latest release.

## Hardware

## Apps

Microsoft Edge has its first preview release on Linux, and OMG Ubuntu gave it a shot. The chromium based browser brings some small touches and features that aren't found in the base browser, like improved bookmarks capabilities.

Apart from Edge, Firefox also got a new release, version 82. This update blocks malicious downloads that you didn't ask for, and notifies you so you can allow the download if it seems legit, and performance has been improved, with flexbox layouts loading 20% faster, and restoring a session taking 17% less time.
