Did his mentor, he wondered, have any advice for him? Pleasingly, he did. Even more pleasingly, this advice sounded as if it had come straight from a movie script. First, Bradlee said, Barber should be sure to \u201cwalk the floor\u201d, in other words, to remain visible to the troops. Second, he should remember that nothing lasts for ever. \u201cThe day you finish as editor, that\u2019s when you find out who your real friends are,\u201d he told Barber, sounding not unlike Jason Robards, who played Bradlee in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jan/13/johnpatterson\">All the President\u2019s Men</a></em>.</p><p>Was he right about this? Fifteen years on, Barber is at last in a position to know, having stood down as editor in January following what he describes in his about-to-be-published diaries as \u201cthree terms\u201d in the job (by his own admission, Barber is obsessed by power and its processes and at moments he starts to sound weirdly presidential himself). He smiles. \u201cHe was partly right,\u201d he says. \u201cMostly, people do call back. But just not as quickly.\u201d And has he, in the months since, been through a grieving process? Such a job, glamorous and important, must have been hard to give up. \u201cNo, no, absolutely not. I had done what I needed to do. The succession had been managed. I\u2019d turned 65. You want to go out on a home run, not with dodgy knees and a bad back.\u201d A banker of his acquaintance once told him that running the <em>FT</em> sounded like being the manager of a rock band, a description that a possibly somewhat flattered Barber thought quite accurate. Now, though, the touring years are over. We meet at his home in suburban south London, a realm of bird tables and Ocado deliveries. No more jetlag. No more starry encounters with the rich and famous. No more creative differences with the editor of How to Spend It.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/nov/01/lionel-barber-i-enjoyed-access-to-thugs-and-the-very-rich-it-was-my-job-to-understand-power\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/nov/01/lionel-barber-i-enjoyed-access-to-thugs-and-the-very-rich-it-was-my-job-to-understand-power", "date_published": "2020-11-01 12:00:19+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Classic James Bond posters up for auction \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>Sotheby\u2019s in London is <a href=\"https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2020/james-bond-film-posters\">hosting an auction of Bond memorabilia</a> in November, including hundreds of classic posters covering the entire series of films from the forthcoming No Time to Die to Dr No, Sean Connery\u2019s debut in the role in 1962.

Admittedly, my descent into Covid glamour has been slow, with makeup the last thing to arrive, just after soap. I started lockdown nine months pregnant in secondhand leggings \u2013 today I am writing in satin amid the smog of two scented candles.

A smoky eye that, rather than seduction and mystery, suggests burning buildings and a sense of inner chaos.</p><p>I think often these days of the decadent aristocrat in Joris-Karl Huysmans\u2019s novel <em>Against Nature</em>, who buys a tortoise because he thinks a moving object will bring out the colours of his new carpet and defy the greyness of the world. Unfortunately, the browns are still too brown, so he covers the tortoise in gold. Which, can I just say, would have been enough for me, but alas Huysmans\u2019s hero Des Esseintes is still not satisfied. He encrusts the tortoise\u2019s shell with jewels, and finally its crawl across his carpet brings the creeping glamour intended. Except, the weight of the stones crushes the poor thing. Luckily, this being a book, a reader may close it before the metaphor kicks in, and be inspired instead by this sweet domestic fantasy. There is no need to ever go out when your carpet is home to a disco tortoise, its carapace glinting beneath the light of the telly.

Training is two miles away, and usually they would travel by car. But, over the summer, the area where they live in Ealing, west London, was designated a low-traffic neighbourhood (LTN). This meant that its streets would be altered to encourage \u201cactive transport\u201d such as cycling and walking, typically by placing planters and bollards across key intersections.

For one sociologist, Trump emerges from a \u201cdeep story\u201d \u2013 AKA a myth \u2013 about the festering grudges of the white working class in the disaffected American heartland; another traumatised commentator describes him as \u201cthe confirmation of all past fears, like a recurring childhood nightmare\u201d. Seen this way, Trump is archetypally coughed up from our psychic sludge.

So what does colour reveal about flavour - and where does orange wine fit in? </p><p><strong>Morrisons The Best Bush Vine Cinsault, Swartland, South Africa 2019 (\u00a38.25, <a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/startWebshop.do\">Morrisons</a>) </strong>How much can you tell about a wine\u2019s flavour just by looking at its colour? Generally speaking, there are enough clues in its appearance to give you a pretty good idea. In red wine, for example, an opaque, deep, dark purple will lead you to expect what you will, nine times of ten, get when you take a sip: a richly flavoured, thickly textured, highly alcoholic wine. The opposite \u2013 pale red, translucent \u2013 suggests elegance, freshness, lightness of flavour and alcohol. But it doesn\u2019t always work out that way. I\u2019ve been caught out a few times by wines made from the currently fashionable (after years in the wilderness) cinsault grape variety in South Africa, such as Morrisons\u2019 very attractive example: these are often attractively glassy and ruby-red in appearance; they may well have a red fruited cast to their flavours too, and a supple weightless drinkability. But they\u2019re not light as such, and at 14.5%, they have a hidden alcoholic power.</p><p><strong>La Gitana Manzanilla, Spain NV (\u00a311.99, <a href=\"https://www.waitrose.com/\">Waitrose</a>) </strong>A lot of the old preconceived notions about appearance in wine are changing, with the once rigidly policed divisions between red, ros\u00e9 and white seemingly dissolving. Many modern ros\u00e9s are so pale (and their flavours so light) they may as well be white. A number of the more interesting reds being made in the natural wine scene look more ros\u00e9 than red. And then there are orange wines \u2013 such as Rigal Vin Orange 2019 (\u00a310) a fun new addition at Morrisons from 25 November \u2013 which are really dry white wines, in that they\u2019re made from white grapes that have been left in contact with their skins for an extended period during the winemaking process, giving them the tannic bite of a red and their own cast of herby, spicy flavours. Finally, there\u2019s the lighter end of fortified wines: a glass of fino or manzanilla sherry, looks just like a straight dry white wine \u2013 and, frankly, with its salty-refreshing style, it works just as well washing down a plate of garlicky prawns.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/01/what-does-the-colour-of-wine-tell-us-about-its-flavour\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/01/what-does-the-colour-of-wine-tell-us-about-its-flavour", "date_published": "2020-11-01 06:00:12+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK industry chief says business needs more from 'thin' Brexit deal", "description": "<p>Carolyn Fairbairn of CBI says her \u2018really big disappointment\u2019 was the lack of help for British services in the potential deal</p><p>A business-led campaign to widen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/24/brexit-walkout-sulk-over-prospects-of-deal\" title=\"\">a \u201cthin\u201d Brexit deal</a> struck between Britain and the European Union will begin immediately in the new year, it has emerged, amid concerns about the long-term effects on the UK\u2019s economy.</p><p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/oct/28/departing-cbi-chief-carolyn-fairbairn-government-brexit-uk\" title=\"\">Carolyn Fairbairn,</a> the outgoing director general of the CBI, said that securing a basic deal with the EU should be seen as a \u201cstarting point\u201d for a deeper relationship.
