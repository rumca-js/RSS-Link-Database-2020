What other channels just give you their trade secrets? Once again, applied laziness wins. I wrote a brief script that takes a list of timecodes and images and audio that it is supposed to illustrate and creates a 1080p HD video slideshow from the contents using ffmpeg and imagemagick.

Imagine actually using a video editor in the current year like a literal peasant. Stop being a hipster who tries to make everything hard for himself and start doing it right.

## Who's in the Deepest Pits of Hell?

Who is the deepest in hell and why? We look at the account of Dante's Divine Comedy, specifically the Inferno and explain why, not just in the context of the story, but in Dante's worldview and politics that Judas Iscariot is accompanied by Brutus and Cassius, betrayers of Caesar being eaten by three-headed Satan for eternity in the icy pits of hell.

This actually involves some of the politics of medieval and renaissance Europe and the occasional clashes of the religious authority of the Pope and the secular authority of the Holy Roman Empire and other kings.
