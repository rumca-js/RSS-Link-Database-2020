I have </strong><strong>explained to her that</strong><strong> </strong><strong>she lacks passion</strong><strong>, no matter how much energy I </strong><strong>bring</strong><strong>. She </strong><strong>rarely initiates sex</strong><strong>, and when she does, she </strong><strong>simply says</strong><strong>: \u201cWe should have sex tonight,\u201d</strong><strong> which </strong><strong>is a turn-off</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>In our last conversation, she said she is just shy</strong><strong>. After several </strong><strong>conversations, she said she understood what she needed to do and </strong><strong>would work on it, but shortly afterwards she asked for sex outright without any real effort </strong><strong>with mood or energy, so I </strong><strong>just didn\u2019t feel</strong><strong> up to it and turned her down again. </strong><strong>Two months on, </strong><strong> </strong><strong>she has </strong><strong>settled back into </strong><strong>just avoiding it. </strong><strong>She is a lovely, </strong><strong>caring woman, but </strong><strong>my patience </strong><strong>has worn thin, which sucks in such a young marriage.

As a rule, positive reinforcement is the best way to teach a person. In your situation, that would mean praising and rewarding even small achievements and never again finding fault. I suspect she is feeling confused \u2013 especially if you have not been sufficiently specific with her about what you like. It is not enough to complain: \u201cYou never initiate sex!\u201d Instead you could, say, mention a video you once saw, where a woman unexpectedly walked through the living room wearing \u201cX\u201d or \u201cY\u201d, then invited a man to follow her upstairs \u2013 and ask her to consider doing something similar. Your wife cannot read your mind, and I believe she does not really understand how to be seductive the way you would like. So, she may need very specific requests such as: \u201cWould you mind doing this, saying this, wearing this?\u201d If she addresses any of your requests in even small ways, be sure to praise and reward her amply. Eventually she will regain confidence. But in terms of her own libido, it is up to you to kindly and non-judgmentally encourage her to share her own interests and tastes with you. This might be uncomfortable for her, so do not push \u2013 again, praise her and act on anything she does reveal. Your job is to discover how she likes to be pleasured \u2013 that is the best way to fix this.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/24/stunning-wife-no-effort-sex-life-losing-interest\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/24/stunning-wife-no-effort-sex-life-losing-interest", "date_published": "2020-11-24 16:17:46+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK coronavirus live: weekly Covid deaths exceed 2,000; four nations still discussing Christmas rules", "description": "<p>Latest updates: first time Covid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/nov/24/uk-coronavirus-live-christmas-rules-tiers-covid-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5fbcd97f8f086720dd6907e2#block-5fbcd97f8f086720dd6907e2\">accounts for more than 20% of deaths in England and Wales since May</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/nov/24/uk-coronavirus-live-christmas-rules-tiers-covid-boris-johnson-latest-updates?page=with:block-5fbcc4c68f087f6ff109cc69#block-5fbcc4c68f087f6ff109cc69\">Christmas statement held up</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/24/test-to-release-cut-england-travel-quarantine-five-days\">\u2018Test to release\u2019 scheme will cut England travel quarantine to five days</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/24/england-covid-tier-system-to-be-based-on-data-released-in-next-few-days\">England Covid system to be based on data released within days</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/23/vaccine-brings-us-a-step-closer-to-ending-covid-says-oxford-scientist\">Vaccine results bring ending Covid a step closer, says Oxford scientist</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/nov/24/coronavirus-live-news-who-says-foreign-experts-to-go-to-china-soon-us-records-more-than-10000-weekly-deaths\">Global coronavirus updates - live </a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-11-24T10:26:56.293Z\">10.26am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p><strong>James Landale</strong>, the BBC\u2019s diplomatic correspondent, says the government is planning to legislate to allow it to abandon the 0.7% of national wealth target for spending on overseas aid.

Three years have passed and yet she is still hearing from people facing injustice. Some of the most worrying stories are about the problems victims are having with the very scheme that was set up to compensate them. <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> hears from <strong>Samantha Cooper</strong>, who was unable to marry Eddie Lindsay, her partner of 25 years and the father of her two daughters, because he had no documentation proving his right to be in the UK, despite the fact that he had lived in the UK legally for more than 50 years. Lindsay died from cancer in 2017 and the compensation team initially rejected Samantha\u2019s claim because they were not married.</p><p>Anushka also talks to <strong>Alexandra Ankrah</strong>, the most senior black <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/home-office\">Home Office</a> employee in the team responsible for the Windrush compensation scheme, who resigned earlier this year. She describes the scheme as systemically racist and unfit for purpose. Amelia says she feels discouraged and disappointed that three years on, nine Windrush victims have died without receiving compensation, and many others are still waiting. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/24/racism-within-the-windrush-compensation-scheme\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/24/racism-within-the-windrush-compensation-scheme", "date_published": "2020-11-24 03:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dianne Feinstein to step down as top Democrat on Senate judiciary panel", "description": "<p>California lawmaker, who has held position for four years, has faced growing opposition from progressives</p><p>The California senator Dianne Feinstein will not seek to retain her position as the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee.</p><p>\u201cAfter serving as the lead Democrat on the Judiciary Committee for four years, I will not seek the chairmanship or ranking member position in the next Congress,\u201d Feinstein said in a statement on Monday.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/23/dianne-feinstein-senate-judiciary-committee\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/23/dianne-feinstein-senate-judiciary-committee", "date_published": "2020-11-24 01:26:04+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK universities perpetuate institutional racism, report says", "description": "<p>UUK calls on leaders to improve understanding and awareness of racism among staff and students</p><p>UK universities \u201cperpetuate institutional racism\u201d and vice-chancellors should undergo training to improve racial literacy as part of a sector-wide crackdown, according to a report.</p><p>Universities UK (UUK), which represents 140 institutions in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, calls on senior leaders to admit where there are problems of racism at their institutions and to improve understanding and awareness among staff and students of racism, racial micro-aggressions, white privilege and white allyship.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/nov/24/uk-universities-perpetuate-institutional-racism-report-says\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/nov/24/uk-universities-perpetuate-institutional-racism-report-says", "date_published": "2020-11-24 00:01:06+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'Antiquated process': data regulator on obtaining Cambridge Analytica warrant", "description": "<p>UK information commissioner calls for international approach to emerging threat<br /></p><p>The information commissioner has criticised the \u201cantiquated process\u201d that led to Facebook getting hold of Cambridge Analytica\u2019s servers before the UK regulator itself, and renewed calls for an international approach to data privacy to tackle the emerging threat of data havens.</p><p>Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, spoke to Damian Collins MP, the former chair of the digital, culture, media and sport committee, who led the parliamentary enquiry into disinformation, <a href=\"https://infotagion.com/\">on his podcast Infotagion</a>.
