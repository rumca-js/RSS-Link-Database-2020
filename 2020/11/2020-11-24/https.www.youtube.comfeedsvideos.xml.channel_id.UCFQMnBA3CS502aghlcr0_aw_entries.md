WhiteHat Jr just sued their two biggest critics for millions of $$$ in court. They claim that they can handle criticism, but that this was merely lies. Does this hold up? Today we examine SOME of the evidence. 
WhiteHat Jr is a kid's coding school in India, or camp that claims to be able to bring kids to computer mastery and even jobs that pay $1.2 million. In India education is paramount, so they pay outrageous sums to try to get their child ahead. This is part of the reason WhiteHat Jr has grown so fast, along with super aggressive marketing.

this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.
