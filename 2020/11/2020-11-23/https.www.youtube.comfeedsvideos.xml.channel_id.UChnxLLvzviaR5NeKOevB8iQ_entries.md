It had been a while since I messed with the medium rack, and I was itching to push the 4ms Spherical Wavetable Navigator into some uncharted territory. I recorded a bunch of custom wavetables into it from Plaits and the TS-L and then set up the Noodlebox to bridge the clock gap between the rack and the Microcosm. Here are 4 jams showing off some different facets of this setup.

00:00 - Jam 1 (breakbeat)
10:18 - Jam 2 (chemical beats)
18:28 - Jam 3 (tech-house)
28:28 - Jam 4 (spooky downtempo)
