<p>This highly entertaining Storyville documentary sifts the evidence on the only unsolved case of air piracy in US history, to ask who the mysterious DB Cooper really was </p><p>Fans of modern American folklore may be familiar with the story of The Hijacker Who Vanished: The Mystery of DB Cooper (BBC Four), but even those who are not should relish this authoritative opportunity to pull up a seat and get out the popcorn. In November 1971, a passenger plane took off from Portland airport for a short flight to nearby Seattle. However, it was hijacked by a man who claimed to have a bomb in his suitcase. He quietly demanded $200,000 in ransom money. The plane landed, his unsuspecting fellow passengers disembarked, the cash was handed over, the flight took off again, and then DB Cooper parachuted out,<strong> </strong>at night and in bad weather, over difficult Oregon terrain. No trace of him was ever found. It remains the only unsolved case of air piracy in US history.</p><p>This wonderfully entertaining Storyville film goes some way towards finding a convincing account of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/13/db-cooper-fbi-closes-case-plane-hijacking-washington-oregon">who DB Cooper might have been</a>. Writer/director John Dower talks to friends, family and acquaintances of different people who may have been the culprit. His interviewees claim to have known plans, heard confessions or seen documents that point the finger at the person they knew.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/23/the-hijacker-who-vanished-the-mystery-of-db-cooper-review-a-real-life-twin-peaks">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Real Sociedad defender on topping the La Liga table, Arteta, Wenger and the ‘shock’ early morning call that took him to north London</p><p>“I don’t know if he got a commission or something,” Nacho Monreal says and starts laughing again. “I woke up one morning to a call from Santi [Cazorla] asking me if I wanted to join. Imagine it: I was in shock, only just awake, not really with it. And by that night, I was an Arsenal player. I reckon the club said: ‘Santi, speak to Nacho: see what he thinks.’”</p><p>It was January 2013, deadline day, and what he thought, insofar as he had time to think anything, was that this was a one-off – an opportunity he couldn’t let pass by. As for Cazorla, if he got a commission it was worth it. A supposedly short-term solution, not planning to go anywhere that morning, Monreal spent seven seasons in London, played over 250 games and won three FA Cups.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/23/nacho-monreal-ive-never-been-a-star-but-i-gave-my-all-for-arsenal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Amid climate crisis, nation’s 53.9C record is not one to be envied</p><p>On 21 July 2016 the temperature in Mitribah, north-west Kuwait, reached 53.9C (129F). This was, at the time, the third highest reading reliably recorded on Earth, and the hottest ever for the whole of Asia. To put this into perspective, this is more than 15C hotter than the UK record high, recorded three years later, of 38.7C.</p><p>The scorching temperature in Mitribah may have been unusual, but this oil-rich state at the top of the Gulf is used to very hot summers. Sandwiched between Iraq to the north and Saudi Arabia to the south, July temperatures here regularly reach the low 40Cs, so most people sensibly stay inside the air-conditioned buildings during the middle of the day; though that luxury is not available to many <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jun/09/poor-people-middle-east-migrant-workers-face-uncertain-post-coronavirus-pandemic-future">migrant workers.</a></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/23/kuwait-among-worlds-hottest-countries-and-its-getting-worse">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Palestinians are hoping a Biden presidency will slow the growing rapport between Saudi Arabia and Israel</p><p>During the last year of Donald Trump’s presidency, the question of whether <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/sep/24/saudi-heir-and-jared-kushner-inch-kingdom-towards-deal-with-israel">Saudi Arabia would make peace with Israel</a> had come down to a question of when.<br /><br />The terms of such a deal were more or less agreed during Trump’s tumultuous term, thrashed out between his envoy and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and the kingdom’s effective ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, who held a very different view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from other Saudi leaders.<br /><br />Their outlook centred on Iran rather than the Israeli-Palestinian conflict being the centre of the region’s dysfunction. And Israel, they agreed, could help, not hinder, progress on that score. Prince Mohammed eschewed his father and uncles’ views that a return to 1967 lines was a starting point for peace, in favour of the Kushner line that Palestinian leaders had caused talks to stagnate.<br /><br />Ties warmed quickly, especially from May 2017, when Saudi Arabia received Trump as a conquering hero after he overturned the nuclear deal with Tehran and reorientated Washington’s focus to Riyadh.<br /><br />The secret channels used to communicate between the kingdom and Israel were discarded. So was the need for mediators, as Saudi officials made regular visits to Tel Aviv and vice versa. Denials of such trips were replaced by hints that they had taken place. Then came <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/31/historic-first-direct-passenger-flight-from-israel-to-uae-takes-off">peace deals with Saudi allies, the UAE</a> and Bahrain, and now a visit by Benjamin Netanyahu to Prince Mohammed on Saudi soil that Israel didn’t bother to disguise.</p><p>Despite a flight path visible on flight tracking sites, which showed the arrival of Netanyahu’s preferred charter jet on the shores of the Red Sea city of Neom, Riyadh responded with a pro forma denial.<br /><br />There to meet the Israeli prime minister on the shores of the Red Sea was outgoing US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, on a mission to finalise as much as he can before he loses his job in eight weeks. Securing a peace pact is something Pompeo, Kushner and Trump have desperately pushed for and such a deal would indeed be seismic in the Middle East, where many are nervously awaiting its impact.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/23/saudis-may-stall-on-trumps-middle-east-peace-plan-now-hes-on-the-way-out">Continue reading...</a>

Astute Labour politician admired for his decency and independent mind<p>In his maiden speech in the Commons in 1970, David Stoddart spoke of the “honest, industrious and very canny” citizens of the busy industrial railway town of Swindon who had just elected him as their MP, in what was the only Labour gain of that election.</p><p>His characterisation of his electorate was a description that might have been applied to the man himself, although “astute” would perhaps have been more appropriate than “canny”. He was a template for the sort of diligent decency found in the Labour party in his political generation and which sometimes, as in his case, led to a parliamentary career in middle life after many years in public service.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/23/lord-stoddart-of-swindon-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Her daring unmade bed won her notoriety – and star status among the Young British Artists. But a hoard of formative work reveals a very different talent</p><p>Before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/emin">Tracey Emin</a>, there was Traci Emin. That was how the young woman who would go on to be a star of conceptual art signed her name on a stark black-and-white woodcut poster back in 1986. It was for her degree show at Maidstone College of Art, where she earned a first in printmaking. It caught my eye a year ago while I was exploring her studio archive.</p><p>The woodcut – showing two desperate lovers clinging together in a dark night of the soul, the woman with an anchor tattoo – is part of a previously unseen hoard of Emin’s all but forgotten early work that reveals a different side of the artist from the one most people think they know. Much of it is lost and exists only as slides, the originals having been destroyed, she thinks, by a former boyfriend. They show the sincere and skilled artist Emin was before she became a household name and an infamous figure to many. When I saw these student works, I wanted to get them published so that everyone else could encounter that intense young soul. I was thrilled when she let me include them in a new visual book about her art.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/nov/23/tracey-emin-unseen-paintings-bed-margate-first-time">Continue reading...</a>

## He Who Must Not Be Named: why is Trump unnamed in so many books?

<p>‘The dictator’, ‘this man’, ‘the president’ – over the last four years, authors have gone out of their way to avoid Trump’s name. But why?<br /></p><p>During the Trump era – which, all being well, will draw to a close in January – the novel has flourished, with writers continuing to interrogate the purpose of fiction in a time when facts are crucial. But many novelists have been reluctant to name the man himself. It is as though Trump is Voldemort, or He Who Must Not Be Named. I first noticed this in Ali Smith’s novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/02/summer-by-ali-smith-review-a-remarkable-end-to-an-extraordinary-quartet">Winter</a>: “An American President is making a speech … The same American President is encouraging the Scouts of America, gathered at the 2017 National Scout Jamboree in West Virginia, to boo the last President and to boo the name of his own opponent in last year’s election.”</p><p>Why, I wondered, not say his name? Then I read Ben Lerner’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/05/the-topeka-school-ben-lerner-review">The Topeka School</a>, in which he shifts into Trump’s voice without naming him: “I helped create her, Ivanka, my daughter, Ivanka, she’s six feet tall, she’s got the best body, she made a lot of money.” Then in Jenny Offill’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/13/weather-by-jenny-offill-review">Weather</a>: “There is a miniature American flag by the register now, right beside the postcard of Ganesh. But Mohan is not worried. ‘Even if this man wins, he will not stay,’ he tells me. ‘Now he has money, planes, beautiful things. He is a bird. Why be a bird in a cage?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/23/he-who-must-not-be-named-why-is-trump-unnamed-in-so-many-books">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Dedicated to her partner, Atwood’s first poetry collection in more than 10 years is wry and entertaining</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/margaretatwood">Margaret Atwood</a> does not do nostalgia. This collection of poems, her first in over 10 years, is a reckoning with the past that comes from a place of wisdom and control. Now 81, she harnesses the experience of a lifetime to assume a wry distance from her subjects – as if, in an astounding world, nothing could throw her off balance. This mastery, even at her most subversively fantastical, is part of what makes her an outstanding novelist. But poetry is different. Atwood is an undeceived poet and, even though the collection is full of pleasures, reading her work makes one consider the extent to which poetry is not only about truth but about the importance of being, at times, mercifully deceived – what Robert Lowell dubbed the “sanity of self-deception”.</p><p>The title poem is about words threatened with extinction.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/23/dearly-by-margaret-atwood-review-the-experience-of-a-lifetime">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many still regards video games as a waste of time or downright sinister.

Who’d have thunk it?</p><p>But why the surprise? For anyone who actually plays video games, this is hardly news. Video games are fun and interesting, and doing fun, interesting things makes you happy. Would we need a study to show that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/comfort-viewing-our-favourite-shows-to-rewatch-in-lockdown">watching a few episodes</a> of a beloved TV show makes you feel good, or that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/series/lockdown-reading">sitting down with a good book</a> is relaxing?

How are Tottenham going to mess this up? A tear in Harry Kane’s ankle? A dodgy lasagne? A global pandemic halting the league? Because in the heat of this moment, in which the world is upside down and anything can happen, the biggest reason why Spurs cannot win the title is that they are Spurs. Apart from the loss to Everton on the opening weekend, they have been better than everybody they have faced – and that has included both Manchester clubs, most recently City on Saturday. After an excellent transfer window, they are looking like a winning José Mourinho team.

<p>I hadn’t seen my friend for months, but when we did meet, it wasn’t the Labour party’s problems, her MA or my house move we talked about …<br /></p><p>There is a shortage of rescue dogs in the UK, particularly staffordshire bull terriers. No one knows why. Maybe all the existing staffs lost their mojo during the first lockdown, and it has interrupted supply. People might be stockpiling staffs, ahead of Brexit shortages. This is only of the mildest imaginable interest when you are not actively seeking a rescue dog, but my friend B was and, for ages, it was all we talked about. She would send links from Spanish dogs’ homes, and now I could probably get a translation job, provided all you needed me to translate was “un perro sociable y amigable”.</p><p>Anyway, Jem eventually arrived, speaking no English but with no discernible Spanish either. When we met in the park, B told me how almost everything about domestic life confused the hell out of him. He would stand on the sofa staring at his paws and swaying about as if he were on a boat, and lift a pie clean out of your hand. From this, she concluded that he had been raised not by humans, but by other dogs. Then we talked for ages about his stance and gait, the way his rolling shoulders gave him a beautiful wildness, but also made him look a little bit like a CGI terror robot from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/18/the-maze-runner-review-young-adult-novel">The Maze Runner</a>, and how his stocky, slightly bowed legs were reminiscent of a young Dennis Waterman.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/23/how-can-you-tell-when-someone-has-a-dog-dont-worry-theyll-tell-you">Continue reading...</a>

## Wrexham's takeover may make football the cart behind a documentary horse

<p>Hollywood owners Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney have made no secret that behind-the-scenes filming has begun</p><p>We stand on the verge of a golden age of North Walian entertainment. Next summer, assuming this godawful pandemic relents, filming will begin on a movie called A League Apart. An “original British romantic comedy”, it will tell the story of lovelorn Phil, forced on the curved horns of a dilemma by his restless girlfriend. He has to choose between her or his deadbeat football team – a tough one for Phil, as Wrexham are just about to play Arsenal in the 1992 FA Cup.</p><p>There is some dramatic irony, in that Wrexham pull off one of the biggest giantkillings of the modern era when Mickey Thomas’s late, rasping free-kick helps to topple George Graham’s league champions. The issue the film hopefully resolves is whether Phil gets to see it, or even better, gives his girlfriend his ticket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/23/wrexham-takeover-football-documentary-ryan-reynolds-rob-mcelhenney">Continue reading...</a>

Observers say Al Faraj was tortured into confessing to three crimes related to protests in the restive Qatif province, including harbouring a fugitive, attending the funeral of a relative in 2012 and sending WhatsApp messages that could affect public security.

<p>The celebrated actor brings his youth in Dublin to vivid life in a tender account of how failing as a priest and a plumber led him to Hollywood </p><p>“How many times have I returned in my dreams to this hill?” asks Gabriel Byrne in the opening sentence of <em>Walking With Ghosts</em>, immediately setting alarm bells ringing in my head. For the following few pages, it did indeed seem that I had entered all-too-familiar territory, what the historian Roy Foster called “the Vaseline on the lens” genre of Irish memoir.</p><p>The initial signs were not good: “gold and green fields... a dark-haired girl... an old farmer woman sat on a one-legged stool”. As someone who read an extract from Frank McCourt’s acclaimed <em>Angela’s Ashes</em> thinking it was a parody of an Irish misery memoir in the vein of Flann O’Brien’s satire <em>The Poor Mouth</em>, I found myself wondering if this might be a celebrity version of the same.

He had taught in Sudan, where I am from, several years ago, and being a reader of this column, sent a note reminiscing about his time there, hoping to hear some news of how it had changed.

<p>Our series of extracts from unstaged scripts continues with Tamsin Oglesby’s play about whether a squad – all women and run by women – can win in a different way </p><p>This is not a play about football. It’s not even a play about women’s football. Although it’s worth noting that when I first mooted the idea around six years ago I was told it was “a bit niche”. However, discussing the commission with the National Theatre four years later I’m glad to say that, what with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/mar/17/euro-2020-postponed-coronavirus-uefa-champions-league-europa-league">the Euros looming</a> and in light of the expanding awareness of the women’s game, it was deemed a plus. But the play is really about power.</p><p>I’ve always loved playing football (five-a-side, some in leagues, some not, men’s teams, women’s teams – anyone who’ll have me basically) and two of the many aspects of it I enjoy are the team ethos and the instinctive obligation to live in the moment. It’s impossible to play a game of football (arguably any sport) and worry about your tax at the same time. So, if casual sexism rears its head on the pitch, and power games are being played by some (male) coaches in the one arena where we should be free from all that, it rankles. Eventually stories of manipulation start coming out, stories that it seems have been held in abeyance by two things; the fear of falling out of favour and that paralysing question: “Or is it me?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/23/fair-play-power-games-in-the-changing-room-of-a-womens-football-team">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Changing Rooms’ flamboyant master of maximalism has made a great living out of being himself. But is lockdown altering him?

And does he have any decor tips for our interviewer?</p><p>If curating your surroundings for a Zoom call is an art, then Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen is its maximalist master. Immersed in the dark colours of his 17th-century manor-house living room, he sits with enviable poise, one arm cocked and propped on his thigh, as though modelling for a portrait. Flanked by a medley of blue velvet and patterned cushions, the latter matching his William Morris-inspired sofa, he is lit by an assortment of lamps.</p><p>It is a stark contrast to my more modest framing – a single pine bookshelf and a large houseplant. I show him the rest of my living room: pale blue walls, a navy/charcoal sofa, a single cushion with Julianne Moore’s face, a coffee table, a few more palms and a TV unit. Britain’s best-known interior designer doesn’t spare my feelings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/23/laurence-llewelyn-bowen-ive-been-trying-to-get-sacked-from-television-for-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A look at the history of US voting rights and what the changing demographics of the country mean for Republicans</p><p>Black and Latino voters overwhelmingly favoured the Democrats in the 2020 US election. Without their huge margins in key states, Joe Biden could not have won, the journalist<strong> Gary Younge </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong>. By 2045, white voters will be in the minority. These changing demographics are a concern for the Republican party. In 2013, just a year after turnout rates for black voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/">surpassed</a> those for white voters for the first time, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/25/voting-rights-act-supreme-court">supreme court gutted</a> the Voting Rights Act, which affected poor, young and minority voters.</p><p>It’s important to remember, Gary tells Anushka, that the US was a slave state for more than 200 years; and an apartheid state, after the abolition of slavery, for another century. It has only been a non-racial democracy for 55 years. And that now hangs in the balance. If Biden does not produce something transformative, the disillusionment among voters may grow and people may once again look for someone who can disrupt the status quo, which is how Donald Trump won in 2016.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/audio/2020/nov/23/gary-younge-on-minority-voters-and-the-future-of-the-republican-party-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
