Effect of high dose, oral cholecalciferol supplementation on SARS-CoV-2 viral clearance

First cholecalciferol intervention study for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals


Design

Randomised, placebo-controlled.

Participants

Asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 

RNA positive vitamin D deficient (25(OH) D less than 20 ng/ml)

Calcifediol, calcidiol, 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3

Pre intervention baseline serum 25(OH) D

Intervention group, 8.6 ng/ml

Control group, 9.54 ng/ml (p=0.730)

10 out of 16 patients could achieve 25(OH)D more than 50 ng/ml by 
day-7

Another two by day-14

Outcome measure

Proportion of patients with SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative before day-21

Change in inflammatory markers

Intervention group (n=16)

60 000 IU of cholecalciferol (oral nano-liquid droplets) for 7 days

Therapeutic target 25(OH)D more than 50 ng/ml

Cholecalciferol supplementation was continued for those with 25(OH)D less than 50 ng/ml

Fibrinogen levels significantly decreased with cholecalciferol supplementation 

10 (62.5%) participants became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative

Control group (n=24)

Placebo

5 (20.8%) participants became SARS-CoV-2 RNA negative (p less than 0.018)

Both groups

Patients requiring invasive ventilation or with significant comorbidities were excluded

25(OH)D levels were assessed at day 7

Regular measurements of: SARS-CoV-2 RNA, fibrinogen, D-dimer, procalcitonin, CRP, ferritin

Improvements

Calcifediol would have been better

Little and often for prevention
