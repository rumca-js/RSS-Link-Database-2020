Second, he said, you\u2019ve gotta nominate Amy Coney Barrett.\u201d\n\nIt was a very different approach than McConnell had taken four-and-a-half years prior, when he refused to allow the Senate to consider President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, after Justice Antonin Scalia died more than eight months before the 2016 presidential election.\n\nBut as sources recount in the documentary, charges of hypocrisy did not deter McConnell. In the aftermath of Ginsburg\u2019s death, McConnell\u2019s political maneuvering went according to his plan \u2014 with Barrett\u2019s speedy confirmation days before the 2020 election serving as a crowning achievement in a hard-fought, decades-long effort to tilt the ideology of the nation\u2019s highest court to the right.\n\r\nGo inside McConnell's effort in \"Supreme Revenge: Battle for the Court,\" an updated version of 2019's \"Supreme Revenge,\" premiering 11/24: https://to.pbs.org/2UUWzgO\n\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\r\n\r\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \r\n\r\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
