I upgraded the WiFi in my Dell XPS 13 (9360) to a new Intel AX200 WiFi 6 adapter.

The upgrade from the original Killer1535 WiFi adapter went very well, even though I accidentally did the whole operation while the computer was running—whoops!

You can get the Wise Tiger Intel AX200 adapter from Amazon: https://amzn.to/3nyfdYn

And at the end of the video, I revealed my true intention for this upgrade. Faster WiFi on the laptop is nice, but I really want to see how my WiFi 6-powered Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 works directly connected to this laptop!

For more on _that_, check out the issue linked to the WiFi 6 card on my Pi PCI Express Card Database: https://pipci.jeffgeerling.com

Welcome to the first episode of my new series, Kubernetes 101!

In this episode, I'll introduce Kubernetes, give some reasons why it might—or might *not*—be a good fit for you, and we'll even build our first cluster and run an application on it!
