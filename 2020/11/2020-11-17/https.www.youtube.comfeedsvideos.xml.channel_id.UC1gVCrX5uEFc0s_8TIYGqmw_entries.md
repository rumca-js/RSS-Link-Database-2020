Kata Training from Ono ha Itto Ryu Kenjutsu style.
Shot by Constant Girel

Ittō-ryū (一刀流), meaning "one-sword school", is the ancestor school of several Japanese Koryū kenjutsu styles. Ono-ha Ittō-ryū (小野派一刀流) is the oldest of the many Ittō-ryū styles which branched off from Ittosai Kagehisa's original art. It continues to be one of the most influential of the traditional kenjutsu styles today, exerting a major influence, along with Hokushin branch, upon modern kendo's kata, tactics, and aesthetic.

Thank you to all who commented below and pointed out that this is not Kendo training. Unfortunately I cannot change text on the video itself, but title and description has been updated.
