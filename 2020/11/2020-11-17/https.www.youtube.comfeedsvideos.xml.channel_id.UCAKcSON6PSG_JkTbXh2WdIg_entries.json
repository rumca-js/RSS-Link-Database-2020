Although the word \"supergroup\" certainly seems to apply, the members of boygenius \u2014 Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus \u2014 don't think of themselves in those terms. \"I like just 'group',\" Baker said, \"because I feel like that fits more with the ethos of this having no demand or specific hyper-expectation around it.\"\n\nTo hear Baker, Bridgers and Dacus explain it, one of the joys of boygenius is not only the fact that the band came together spontaneously and serendipitously, but also that they really enjoy working and performing together. \"I believe in these songs even more so because they're Phoebe's and Julien's songs, too,\" Dacus said. \"And I'm a fan of theirs, so I can hype this project more comfortably than my own stuff. And it's just a lot of fun, too. It's like a third of the pressure but three times the payoff.\"\n\nWatch the full set by boygenius above.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Souvenir\"\n3:26 \"Me & My Dog\"\n6:33 \"Ketchum, ID\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nJulien Baker \u2013 vocals, mandolin, piano\nPhoebe Bridgers \u2013 vocals, guitar\nLucy Dacus - vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/11/17/boygenius-perform-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#boygenius #phoebebridgers #lucydacus #julienbaker", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBTmxpDR-rM", "date_published": "2020-11-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "CAAMP - three songs at The Current (2019)", "description": "One year ago today \u2014 on Nov. 16, 2019 \u2014 Ohio band Caamp visited our studio to play three songs off their album, \"By and By.\" Watch that three-song set above.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Peach Fuzz\"\n2:10 \"Wolf Song\"\n5:39 \"Wunderbar\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nTaylor Meier \u2013 guitar, vocals\nEvan Westfall \u2013 banjo \nMatt Vinson \u2013 bass\nJoe Kavalec \u2013 keys\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/11/16/caamp-perform-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#caamp #caampband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-q2f0rkbrg", "date_published": "2020-11-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
