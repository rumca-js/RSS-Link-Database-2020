I can't stand it when people pretend to be victim of their on behavior, as if they aren't the ones in control. Don't "resist" temptation, just don't do it, or flee if you have to.

A lot of people pretend to be battling "temptations" that they still privately enjoy falling for. Then they pretend to be devoid of agency and claim they "couldn't help themselves." In truth, this is mostly a way of having your degenerate cake and sanctimoniously throwing it away at the same time.

I also talk about at least to heuristics/rules of thumb to behaviorally avoid temptation.
