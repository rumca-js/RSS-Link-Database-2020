Ramirez is one of the Americans featured in FRONTLINE’s latest documentary, from a production team headed by Mike Shum and Blair Woodbury. "American Voices: A Nation in Turmoil" captures the diverse perspectives of a number of people — a pastor, a barber, a doctor, an activist and more — as they deal with COVID-19 in their communities, respond to George Floyd’s killing, and experience the 2020 election and its aftermath as COVID cases and deaths mount once again.
