Lawrence Douglas describes what Trump\u2019s behaviour means for the country</p><p>More than a week after the US election was called in favour of Joe Biden, Donald Trump is continuing to issue false claims about fraudulent voting and is refusing to concede. While his behaviour may seem shocking, it\u2019s not a great surprise, says <strong>Lawrence Douglas</strong>, the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07ZZ6PPBJ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">Will He Go?</a> </p><p>He tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> that Trump\u2019s refusal to accept defeat was inevitable given the campaign he ran, and that his legal challenges are almost entirely without merit. However, while there is little he can practically do to remain in power, there is a political impact of a sitting president refusing to follow the norms of peaceful transition, which could have a lasting effect on US democracy and the country\u2019s reputation abroad. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/17/what-will-it-take-for-donald-trump-to-concede-defeat\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/17/what-will-it-take-for-donald-trump-to-concede-defeat", "date_published": "2020-11-17 03:00:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus live news: vaccine trials 'encouraging' says WHO; South Korea tightens curbs in Seoul", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/nov/17/coronavirus-live-news-vaccine-progress-encouraging-says-who-south-korea-at-critical-crossroads?page=with:block-5fb316b08f0845db31fb4c07#block-5fb316b08f0845db31fb4c07\">Seoul social distancing level raised to 1.5</a>; <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/16/california-coronavirus-surge-roll-back-reopening\">California applies \u2018emergency break\u2019 to reopening</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/16/moderna-covid-vaccine-candidate-almost-95-effective-trials-show\">Second vaccine candidate almost 95% effective, trials show</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/16/what-does-moderna-vaccine-mean-fight-covid\">What does the Moderna vaccine mean for fight against Covid?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/16/trump-vaccine-moderna-biden-coronavirus\">Trump bids to take credit for Moderna vaccine while Biden offers cautious optimism</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/16/merkel-germany-soft-covid-lockdown-chancellor-social-interaction\">Schools and parties in spotlight as Germany weighs new rules</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-11-17T02:49:22.025Z\">2.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p>In the US, the president-elect, Joe Biden, has warned \u201cmore people may die\u201d unless the Trump administration starts cooperating with the incoming Democratic administration. </p><p>\u201cWe are going into a very dark winter.
