This episode was made in partnership with The Kavli Prize. The Kavli Prize honors scientists for breakthroughs in astrophysics, nanoscience and neuroscience — transforming our understanding of the very big, the very small, and the very complex.

The apparent void in the darkness of space is not as empty as you might think. In fact, it somehow holds the key to creating stars, planets, and even us! And Dutch super-scientist Ewine van Dishoeck made it her life's work to figure out how interstellar gas and dust turned into us.
