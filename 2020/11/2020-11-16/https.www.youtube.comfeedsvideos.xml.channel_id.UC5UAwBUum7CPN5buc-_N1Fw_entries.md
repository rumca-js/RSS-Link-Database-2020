Mint added Chromium back to their repos, as a regular package. Mint had lost easy access to Chromium when Ubuntu transitioned it to a snap package, since Mint refused to ship any snaps, or Snapd, and even prevented its installation.

Dell is working on a hardware privacy driver for the Linux kernel. Beginning in their 2021 laptops, they'll ship physical buttons to disable the mic and the camera, and since Dell ships some laptops with Linux preinstalled, they're also working on the necessary driver to handle these switches.

KDE is working on a redesign of their system monitor, and it looks great. It uses nice charts and graphs to let you get a bird's eye view of how your system is running, and it uses unified code with the system monitor plasma widgets.

VKD3D-proton, the VKD3D fork made to work specifically with Proton, has seen a new release, version 2.0.

Proton 5.13-2 is now available, with a bunch of fixes. It also includes version 2.0 of VKD3D Protin which we just talked about. With that nex release, you'll get fixes for RIsk of Rain 2, Killer Instinct, Games not launching with Uplay connect or Origin after updating, Mount and Blade 2 bannerlord, Warhammer 40K Inquisitor, and Middle Earth Shadow of war. It should be noted that using VKD3D proton brings a few issues, especially the fact that controler hot plugging doesn't work, and Vulkan layers like Vkbasalt or MangoHud won't start.
