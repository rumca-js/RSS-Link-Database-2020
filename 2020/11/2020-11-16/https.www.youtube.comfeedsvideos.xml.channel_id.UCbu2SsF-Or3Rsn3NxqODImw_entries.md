The PlayStation 5's SSD is an impressive piece of hardware, but it does have limited storage space; here are some tips on how to optimize your console's SSD.

The PlayStation 5 may come with a 825 GB SSD, but that doesn't mean you can use it all. In fact, there's only 667 GB of precious storage for your games. Given that some AAA titles regularly clock in over 100 GB (we're looking at you, Call of Duty), and PlayStation 5 games can't be moved onto an external hard drive, let alone be played from one, that's going to fill up fast.

SSD storage is coming for the PlayStation 5 eventually, but it's not available at launch, so in this video, we give you our top tips to save space on your console. From specific Trophy settings to turn off to game prioritization to, crucially, ensuring that you're putting your PlayStation 4 games on a USB hard drive, there are many things you can do to get the most out of your PlayStation 5's internal storage. 

We have plenty of features about the PlayStation 5 up on GameSpot, including a roundup of hidden features that you'll definitely want to check out, as well as in-depth looks and reviews of its launch lineup.

Remember When Halo Almost Wasn’t An Xbox Game: https://youtu.be/noE49iZ9Reg

In this video, Kurt chronicles the journey of Microsoft’s daring foray into the gaming industry with the Xbox through its many missteps, to its crowning achievements. Starting all the way back in 1998 with the console’s conception, the Xbox was the brainchild of Seamus Blackley, and entered the gaming market competing head on with Sony’s astronomically successful PlayStation 2. While going toe-to-toe with the PS2 was a steep uphill battle, Microsoft still managed to place itself among its contemporaries as a worthy competitor, outselling Nintendo’s GameCube that generation.

For the Xbox 360, Microsoft came out swinging a whole year ahead of the PS3 and Wii, and while that head start was pivotal to the console’s success, the 360 still faced many challenges along the way--most notably the infamous Red Ring of Death dilemma. Still, by the end of its lifespan, the Xbox 360 was hugely successful, and set the bar high for what was to come with the Xbox One. Unlike the Xbox 360, the Xbox One was a major misstep for Microsoft, but one that ultimately led to a historical change of course that that has led the company to its current vision and values heading into this next generation with the Xbox Series X/S. With Xbox on the cusp of its fourth generation, it’s suffice to say that story is far from over.
