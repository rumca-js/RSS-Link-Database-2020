The building was evacuated and, another 20 minutes later, a fire was discovered spreading through <em>la forêt</em> – the forest of rafters made from 1,400 trees that hold up the massive leaded roof of the 800-year-old gothic glory. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/16/notre-dame-came-15-to-30-minutes-close-to-complete-destruction">The race was on to save the storied structure</a> and the treasures therein.</p><p>The Night Notre Dame Burned (BBC Four) tells the story of the 12 infernal hours that followed.

The “campaigning football star”, we were told, had taken out “mortgages from the Queen’s bank, Coutts, for all five properties”. Meanwhile the authors of the article seemed particularly keen to inform readers that Rashford has begun the process of trademarking his name in the US, and that his own house is worth £1.85m and has six bedrooms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/16/mail-on-sunday-v-marcus-rashford-a-sinister-attack-on-a-young-black-man">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Available online </strong><br />This collection of dancers’ homemade films – in apartments, backyards or the great outdoors – connect in winningly lo-fi way</p><p>As some dance companies get slicker in their digital offerings, Mark Morris’s latest <a href="https://markmorrisdancegroup.org/40th-anniversary-digital-season/">videodance evening</a> remains resolutely DIY: the dancers film themselves on their phones and musical director Colin Fowler edits together the sometimes fuzzy footage.</p><p>It’s quite possible they like working that way, but it’s also a reminder of how financially stretched even acclaimed, established companies such as <a href="https://markmorrisdancegroup.org/">Mark Morris Dance Group</a> (celebrating its 40th anniversary this year) are right now. Yet the genial, lo-fi nature of the occasion is exactly what’s appealing about it. The dances themselves are short, from two to seven minutes long, and the rest is engaging chat with Morris and Fowler, calling in from their respective New York homes. It’s like dropping in on a friend’s Zoom meet as they muse on the dance, the music and adapting to the situation we’re all in. This opportunity to get a bit closer to the people making the performances could be a nice legacy of lockdown. Certainly you enjoy the work more when you’re invested in the artists involved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/16/dance-on-review-mark-morris-group-connect-homemade-films">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on Rishi Sunak: time to create jobs, not anxiety | Editorial

<p>Covid exposes the key government role in maintaining the total level of spending in the economy at a level that keeps the country as close to full employment as possible</p><p>A great deal of poverty in Britain can be blamed on joblessness, insufficient hours of work, and low pay. The pandemic has emphasised that the penury that too many suffer in this country is nothing to do with the shortcomings of workers. It is do with a shortage of work. That is why the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, in next week’s mini-budget, should scrap plans to abolish, in April 2020, the £20 a week extra benefit payments going to 6m low-income households. A <a href="https://www.resolutionfoundation.org/events/coping-with-the-crunch/" title="">report</a> by the Resolution Foundation reveals that the longer the pandemic has gone on, the harder the poorest have been hit. People who did nothing but stoically bear the brunt of the crisis ought not be made to pay for it.</p><p>Coronavirus has thrown into sharp relief the inequalities in Britain. The bottom fifth of the working population have seen incomes cut sharply and their savings reduced to nothing. For the poor, there’s little or no cash to furnish even the barest of Christmases, while those at the top have seen cash pile up in bank accounts. What is needed, as the former prime minister <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/gordon-brown-demands-tories-halt-23018678" title="">Gordon Brown</a> made clear at the launch of the Resolution Foundation report, is a U-turn. Without a rethink from Mr Sunak, around 700,000 people, including 300,000 children, will sink into poverty at a time of surging unemployment and plummeting living standards.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/16/the-guardian-view-on-rishi-sunak-time-to-create-jobs-not-anxiety">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Tenet director has dismissed critics of his poor sound mixing by blaming us for being too conservative. Why must he keep toying with our perception of sound? </p><p>We’re all aware of the impossible situation that film currently finds itself in. Screens started shutting in the summer. This is because the big new movies have all been postponed. This is because movie studios are nervous about losses. And this is because Tenet, the great bellwether of cinema in 2020, underperformed theatrically.</p><p>But perhaps an alternate dimension exists where cinema is still thriving. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2019/aug/24/game-of-thrones-star-kit-harington-joins-marvels-the-eternals">The Eternals</a> is breaking box-office records.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/no-time-to-die"> No Time to Die</a> is still showing to packed houses.

And it’s all because people flocked to Tenet in their droves. What separates that dimension from this? That version’s Tenet had a better sound mix. People saw it, they understood it, they didn’t immediately tell all their friends that it was frustrating and incomprehensible, and as a result it gave Hollywood the confidence to spring back into action.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/16/tenet-up-listen-christopher-nolan-interstellar-sound-mixing">Continue reading...</a>

When lockdown came chinks appeared in my wife’s armour and I picked up Juno the goldador (a cross breed between a golden retriever and a labrador). It was love at first sight. My wife mocks my devotion. In particular, she laughs at the adoring gaze, once reserved for her, that she says crosses my face several times a day.

<p>Giorgio Moroder: ‘The lyrics were written by a guy who came to fix my Ferrari. It won me my third Oscar’</p><p>Before I was in Berlin I auditioned for the part of Princes Leia in Star Wars. I was 15 but looked 12. Harrison Ford was over 30 but looked 19 or 20. We <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KXy59jMqOsc">sat in deckchairs to say our lines</a>. George Lucas, bless him, sent me a letter thanking me and saying: “We chose Carrie Fisher, but we’d like to help you.” He introduced me to Steven Spielberg and all these guys. I was offered the part of <a href="https://groovyhistory.com/charlene-tilton-a.k.a.-lucy-ewing">Lucy Ewing in Dallas</a>, but the seven-year contract scared me because I really wanted to do music. My mother told me to go with my heart, but my agent was so annoyed with me for turning down Dallas that he dropped me. A year later, I met John Crawford [bass/vocals] and joined Berlin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/16/giorgio-moroder-take-my-breath-away-top-gun-how-we-made-berlin-tom-cruise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hamilton has proved to every child, no matter their background, it is worth following their dreams</p><p>It is impossible to compare drivers across different eras of motor racing, they can only really be judged as of their time. But what I can say without hesitation about Lewis Hamilton now he has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/15/lewis-hamilton-wins-turkish-gp-to-clinch-record-equalling-seventh-f1-world-title-michael-schumacher">secured his seventh world championship</a> is that he is, by a million miles, the greatest driver of his generation and you can argue he will go on to be the greatest Formula One driver of all time.</p><p>Until now the greatest for me was Juan Manuel Fangio because I was a child of that era and Fangio won five championships when drivers were being killed and he did it with four different manufacturers. That was an exceptional record, no one thought it could be beaten. Then Michael Schumacher came along and took seven and matching that did not seem realistic. Now there is Lewis not only equalling Michael but in every position to go one better as the most successful driver in F1. There could easily be an eighth and ninth championship and right now it is hard not to picture it because his talent and the engineering expertise Mercedes have demonstrated is mind-blowing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/16/lewis-hamilton-bravery-aged-10-extraordinary-f1-background">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Brooks Almy, 70 and Maurizio Papalia, 67, met on a cruise ship in the 70s. After years apart, they reunited in 2008 and now live with their dog and cat in Italy</p><p>Brooks Almy joined a cruise ship in 1977 to work in theatre. She was introduced to Maurizio Papalia, an Italian nurse who had also taken a job onboard. “We had a really nice connection straight away,” she says. They spent the next four months as a couple, sailing around Mexico and the Caribbean. When Brooks’s contract came to an end, they tried to make it work. “I came back to shore every few weeks,” says Maurizio. “But two months later I had to go back to Italy. We were both upset, but decided to keep in touch.” Without email or affordable travel, it became difficult, so they agreed to start dating other people.</p><p>In 1978, Maurizio married an English woman and had a child, but by 1984 their relationship was over. By that time, Brooks had moved to New York to pursue a career on Broadway. “I went to see her and the connection was still there,” says Maurizio. The pair started dating again, but their happiness was short-lived. “I was a very heavy drinker at the time,” says Brooks. “I’ve been in addiction recovery for 35 years, but at the time I was crashing hard. I went to meet Maurizio in Italy in 1985, but I was in an extremely fragile state.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/16/how-we-met-she-was-the-love-of-my-life-but-she-had-to-focus-on-getting-sober">Continue reading...</a>

At the gate, he is often waiting for his wife, also in her mid-eighties (and in my opinion the best dressed <em>signora</em> in our neighbourhood). It is a good day if, when coming round the corner from my part of the building, I coincide with her coming down the stairs from hers, so we can walk to the gate together, and therefore meet her husband, with his performed exasperation and obvious pride. Meeting her is rare, though. Usually I see only him, waiting, and he always asks, “<em>Vai a spasso?” </em>(“Going for a saunter?”), and I always say yes, even when I am rushing to the optician. And because trips these days out are short and masked, I might also see him on my way back, still waiting. And if it is lunchtime, which it often is, he always says the same thing. “<em>Vai a cucinare la pasta?</em>” (“Going to cook pasta?”), and I always reply yes, because I probably am, again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/16/rachel-roddy-a-recipe-for-life-and-for-pasta">Continue reading...</a>

He’d often go and sit in a field for hours.</p><p>By June, the situation was impossible. Pinnock was waiting for a self-employed grant from the government when he was asked to leave. (As a lodger, he was classified as an excluded occupier, making him exempt from the eviction ban.) He went to his parents’ place in London. They both have health issues and Pinnock didn’t want to expose them to the virus, so for the next month, he slept in a shed in their garden, creeping into the house only when they were out to shower and use the toilet. “You can’t live in a shed,” he says. “It was fun for the first week but the novelty wore off.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/16/im-seeing-an-industry-disappear-how-lockdown-is-leaving-hospitality-workers-homeless">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A slew of initiatives from local councils have meant drivers being moved off residential streets and on to busier main roads. But while many residents support the schemes, the measures have provoked protests</p><p>As England entered lockdown in the spring, there was a huge switch away from public transport and into private cars. The government, fearing gridlock and spikes in pollution, acted quickly to allocate powers and funding to local councils for implementing traffic restrictions. The move has resulted in 200 schemes being drawn up, the majority of which are in London where traffic is often most dense. But they have not been universally welcomed, with some residents reacting with fury. </p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Peter Walker </strong>tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>that these kinds of measures are not new and that while a minority may loudly protest, many more are supportive and will welcome the benefits. Rachel also hears from <strong>Jon Burke</strong>, a Labour councillor in Hackney, east London, who says the schemes are needed and that electrification of vehicles will not come fast enough to combat the problems of spiralling emissions caused by increased car use. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/16/how-traffic-reduction-schemes-are-dividing-neighbourhoods-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
