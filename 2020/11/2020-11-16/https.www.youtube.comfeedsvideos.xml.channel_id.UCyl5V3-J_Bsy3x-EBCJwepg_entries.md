Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk to Alisa Childers, who first gained fame by being in the Christian Pop band, ZOEgirl. Alisa has since moved on from music into becoming a Christian Apologist with her own podcast and her debut book, Another Gospel?, available wherever you find books. 

Alisa‚Äôs apologist story began when she discovered her Pastor was a self proclaimed ‚ÄúHopeful Agnostic‚Äù thus leading her on a journey of discovering historic Christianity and the true meaning of rap core. Ethan and Kyle receive all the CCM back stories including that of the mysterious Carman.¬†
