One year ago, the Nashville duo Wild Ponies — comprising Doug and Telisha Williams — visited our studio for a session. Wild Ponies had a big plan for their 2017 record, "Galax." They could have gone into a nice, plush Nashville studio and recorded it with a few of the town's wonderful session players. Instead, they chose to bring those same players up to their Blue Ridge Mountains hometown of Galax, Va., to play alongside of some of the area's local musical legends. Wild Ponies were so happy with the energy of the sessions that they didn't even bother to listen to the final recordings until they got back to Nashville for mastering.

Doug and Telisha have been playing together since high school, and at least before the pandemic, they remained heavy road warriors. When they were in our area last November for a handful of gigs in the Twin Cities and in southwestern Minnesota, they brought their gear into our studio for this session.

Two years ago, Hippo Campus performed back-to-back shows at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minn. The band's two nights of hometown shows came just two months after the release of their "Bambi" album, and capped off their fall 2018 U.S. tour. The Current crew were on hand for one of those two sold-out shows, providing a live video stream of the concert to fans enjoying the show remotely. Watch three performances from that November 2018 show by Hippo Campus at the Palace Theatre.
