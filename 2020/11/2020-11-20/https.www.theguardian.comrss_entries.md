<p>The two men may well line up alongside each other for the next Lions tour but Itoje will not ‘waste time’ by focusing on his rival</p><p>Even if Maro Itoje and James Ryan did not play international rugby in the same position the pair would have a lot in common. In addition to being the forward totems of their respective nations they have both studied politics at university and share a strong sense of cultural history, with Itoje particularly fascinated by Nigeria’s past and Ryan’s great-grandfather having been involved in the 1916 Easter Rising.</p><p>Next summer it is quite possible the two men will have plenty of time to put the world to rights on the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa, with every prospect they will be shoulder to shoulder in the second row when the Tests commence. In the meantime, though, there are two feisty Anglo-Irish clashes to negotiate before either man can be considered first among equals.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/20/rugby-union-england-ireland-autumn-nations-cup-preview-maro-itoje-james-ryan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former defender discusses the pain of the John Terry incident, the abuse his mother suffered and his documentary on racism</p><p>‘I carried the burden of not speaking out for so long, for nine years,” Anton Ferdinand says as he explains how haunted he has been. Ferdinand suffered terribly as the victim in the most controversial incident of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2011/oct/24/john-terry-anton-ferdinand-video" title="">alleged racial abuse</a> in the history of English football. During a Premier League game between Queens Park Rangers and Chelsea in October 2011, John Terry said the words “fucking black cunt” in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/oct/23/john-terry-racist-remarks-anton-ferdinand" title="">a spat with Ferdinand</a> that ended up in court and the subject of a Football Association disciplinary hearing – which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/feb/03/john-terry-stripped-england-captaincy-racism" title="">cost Terry the England captaincy</a>.</p><p>Until now, however, the world has been oblivious to the pain Ferdinand endured. His decision to remain silent burned a hole inside him. “I have kicked myself and beat myself up for years for not speaking out,” he says quietly. This is Ferdinand’s first interview since participating in a searing and deeply moving BBC documentary – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000pzpr" title="">Football, Racism and Me</a> – which will be screened a week on Monday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/20/anton-ferdinand-i-have-kicked-myself-for-years-for-not-speaking-out-john-terry">Continue reading...</a>

## Trump sank lower, but that doesn't mean Johnson isn't knee-deep in sleaze | Jonathan Freedland

<p>A damning report makes clear how complacent we’ve been: under cover of Covid, taxpayers’ money has been abused</p><p>The gradual, reluctant departure of Donald Trump removes a man who performed a vital function for the UK government. He served as a lightning rod and handy distraction, diverting attention away from our own rulers by reliably being more appalling, more outrageous and more incompetent than they could ever manage. However low they sank, they could always point across the Atlantic to someone who had sunk lower. Trump absorbed a lot of emotional energy that way, soaking up fury that might otherwise have been directed closer to home. But now that his slow retreat from the centre of global consciousness is under way, his utility as a decoy is diminishing. Once Trump is no longer gobbling up all the attention, our gaze can settle more steadily on our own masters. And it is not a pretty sight.</p><p>For even though Boris Johnson never told anyone to inject bleach, his government’s handling of the pandemic has been disastrously bad by any measure except direct comparison with Trump’s. Whether it’s the late decision-making, including a delay to the first lockdown that is estimated to have cost <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52995064">25,000 lives</a>, and a second one imposed five weeks after the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54528983">experts had warned</a> a circuit break was urgently required; sending infected people back into care homes without testing; the baffling decision to allow mass gatherings to go ahead and to allow air travellers to keep arriving without even the most basic checks once they had landed; or the serial failures to set up a functional <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/13/what-has-gone-wrong-with-englands-covid-test-and-trace-system">test-and-trace system</a>, the record is abysmal – borne out by the fact that Britain has the highest death toll in Europe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/20/trump-johnson-sleaze-covid-nao-report-money">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anxiety, lack of sleep and other stress triggers can lead to unhealthy levels of cortisol in the body, which results in dull, lifeless skin and a loss of elasticity. Regain your glow with these mind-calming techniques</p><p>When our lives change in unexpected ways, as they did this year, stress can take its toll. Our normal routines are disrupted and we’re constantly wired as we juggle endless video calls, contemplate the latest news and grapple with the logistics of lockdown. We’re exercising less and worrying more. The result is that our shoulders are hunched, our jaws are tight and our minds are constantly whirring.</p><p>All that stress plays out on our skin too. Stress triggers the brain to release fight or flight hormones such as cortisol, which causes ageing inflammation throughout the body, and our skin – the body’s largest organ – is no exception. Acute periods of stress can trigger breakouts and flare-ups of skin conditions such as eczema, while chronic stress impacts skin every day as cortisol impairs its natural ability to heal itself. This disrupts the skin’s barrier function, which normally keeps moisture in and irritants out, leading to a dull complexion and noticeably dryer skin. Stress also increases free radicals, leading to ageing and a loss of elasticity and bounce. The good news is that products such as <a href="https://www.lancome.co.uk/skincare/by-range/genifique/advanced-genifique-serum/26901c-LAC.html?utm_source=netaffiliation&amp;utm_medium=website_partnership&amp;utm_content=lan_skin_genifique_text_aw&amp;utm_campaign=guardian-labs&amp;utm_term=online-feature-1" rel="nofollow">Lancôme’s Advanced Génifique Serum</a> help to alleviate the impact that stress has on skin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/skincare-gets-gutsy/2020/nov/20/breathe-walk-rest-eight-mindfulness-techniques-to-improve-your-complexion">Continue reading...</a>

For many, the unprecedented nature of this year has had a negative effect both physically and mentally, but with the end of the year fast approaching and the promise of a fresh start in 2021, now is a great time to give mind, body and soul a much needed overhaul.</p><p>“This year, few of us have looked after ourselves the way we deserve to be looked after,” says personal fitness and strength trainer Matt McCormack (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/mattmccormackpt/?hl=en" rel="nofollow">@mattmccormackpt</a>). “Due to no fault of our own, we’ve neglected to give our bodies what they need, and anxiety and stress levels for many have been understandably sky-high.

<p>Driven by camaraderie and passionate about the wild planet, Dwayne Fields and Phoebe Smith are challenging the traditional view of the ‘outdoors type’</p><p>Dwayne Fields and Phoebe Smith are no strangers to pushing things forward, not least their own powers of endurance. Travel writer, author and broadcaster Smith, who has made a career of wild-camping in extreme locations, and explorer and presenter Fields, the first black Briton to walk to the north pole, will readily confess to little hacks ranging from energy-giving handfuls of Jelly Babies to the indispensability of inflatable pillows for travelling. But their most essential piece of kit is optimism and a sense of humour. Even on gruelling hikes peppered with freezing streams, soaked sleeping bags and muddy tents, they have a motto: “Enjoy not endure”.</p><p>It certainly stood them well on their 828-mile, 40-night, north-to-south expedition over mainland Britain last year, wild-camping everywhere from the middle of marshlands to beside motorways. This was both a practice run and a fundraiser for their plan, under the banner of their #WeTwo foundation, to take a group of 20 underprivileged young people from the UK to Antarctica in 2021 – part of their broader mission to change people’s mindsets about adventuring and caring for the planet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/drink-outside-the-box/2020/nov/20/we-want-to-change-the-mindset-when-it-comes-to-the-outdoors-the-duo-breaking-down-barriers-in-the-adventure-world">Continue reading...</a>

<p>We would like to hear about whether you are spending more or less, and how things have changed due to coronavirus</p><p>The pandemic has changed many aspects of our lives this year, but one of the starkest changes has been our relationship with money. Lots of people have been thrown out of work or put on furlough, and are having to cut their spending accordingly. But even people who have kept their jobs are spending less. Some are anxious about the future and are saving for a rainy day. Others can’t spend even if they’d like to: shops and restaurants are closed, and we are travelling less – for both work and pleasure. Even the wannabe spenders are having to save. Will this produce a revolution in our attitude to money?</p><p>How have you found your spending habits and view of money changing in the past eight months? Are you spending less?

<p>A Northern Irish accent immediately adds three points to a person’s attractiveness</p><p>I am from Liverpool, so am well versed in regional accents. Mine was never pronounced (so to speak) and, after living abroad, then Oxford and now London, it slip-slides; a baby deer on ice. Often people narrow their eyes at me, trying to work out where I am from. It may be unplaceable, but going back to Liverpool and spending time around scousers, it tends to pick up again.</p><p>This is something called the chameleon effect. We subconsciously mirror people’s accents and body language to fit in.

## Furlough payments have ruined our chances of getting a mortgage

<p>The lender will only calculate the loan on these payments, not my partner’s other income</p><p><strong>We have been rejected for a mortgage because of changes to banks’ lending policies when someone has claimed any amount</strong><em><strong> </strong></em><strong>of government furlough money. My partner was paid £590 in furlough over two months before he was able to resume supporting himself. As director of a limited company his salary is only a small part of his income. However, despite company accounts showing his total income, the lender has told us they will calculate his earnings based on four times the furlough income only. It looks like we will not be able to buy our first home.<br /></strong><em><strong>RW, London</strong></em></p><p>The pandemic has created especially tough conditions for the self-employed, and lenders have become much more cautious in how they assess credit worthiness. Many are scrutinising earnings from the past three months, as well as annual accounts to judge whether Covid has squeezed income. According to Valentine Mulholland, credit policy specialist at the <a href="https://moneyandpensionsservice.org.uk/">Money and Pensions Service</a>, each lender is taking its own approach to risk and some are more welcoming to self-employed applicants than others, so it’s worth finding a mortgage broker who can help you navigate the options.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/20/furlough-payments-have-ruined-our-chances-of-getting-a-mortgage">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Music doesn’t only transport us to happy times and places – it can, as this adventurer found, be a companion and motivator on our travels</p><p>Day one of lockdown 2, and I’m listening to a playlist called Sunny Days. Bob Marley’s Three Little Birds comes on and suddenly I’m no longer in my cramped bedroom cum office cum yoga studio cum gym, but back on a beach in the Philippines, where I lived above a reggae bar after graduating. In the month it took me to complete my Divemaster qualification there, my love for the ocean and its creatures deepened so much that I would dedicate my life to protecting them. I can see the tiny green islands dotted along the horizon in front of me, and the scuba-diving heaven below them; I imagine the manta rays, sharks and multi-coloured tropical fish that we spent every day with, and replay the conversations I had with my good friend there about how we would look after these phenomenal creatures.<br /><br />Six years later and I was on my paddleboard, propelling myself through Scottish waters. I’d been paddling almost every day for nearly two months on <a href="https://www.calmajor.com/sup-lands-end-to-john-ogroats">my journey from Land’s End to John O’groats</a>. It was 11am, and I’d been on the water since 4am. The fog was so thick I couldn’t navigate by sight. I couldn’t see any land, and was relying on my GPS unit to direct me to shore. Instead of the crystal-clear, glassy flat waters of the Philippines I was cutting through choppy, grey waves, the occasional gull my only company. I was exhausted, fed up and a little bit scared. But I’d got my headphones on, pressed play on my motivational playlist and Bob Marley appeared, telling me that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD3F7J2PeYU">Every Little Thing is Gonna Be Alright</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/nov/20/bob-marley-helped-me-paddleboard-lands-end-john-ogroats-music-travel">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actors star in Happiest Season, the first mainstream festive romcom about a same-sex couple. They talk about their friendship, the sudden abundance of queer content – and run the rule on Love, Actually</p><p>“It’s a gay Christmas movie,” says Kristen Stewart. “And I know that’s an annoying thing to label it right off the bat, but, for me, that is extremely attractive, and sounds like ... a huge exhale.”</p><p>Quietly and unobtrusively, Happiest Season feels like a big deal. It’s a festive romcom, directed by Clea DuVall, and stars <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4496875/">Mackenzie Davis</a> as Harper and Stewart as Abby, a couple who are forced to navigate Harper’s conservative, wealthy family at Christmas. Over five increasingly frantic days, they have to pretend to be friends who just happen to live in the same apartment, for fear of Harper’s parents finding out they are together. While those ingredients could make for a potentially hefty drama, Happiest Season cooks them up into comedy, finding touching moments amid the sharply written silliness and chaos. It’s funny, it’s ambitious and it’s the first mainstream gay Christmas romcom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/20/kristen-stewart-and-mackenzie-davis-gay-christmas-movie-happiest-season">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Anything could happen at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Foxes sniff their chance and Lookman can bounce back</p><p>Both sides have personnel problems and coming in the immediate aftermath of an international break, Tottenham’s home match against Manchester Cityseems nigh on impossible to predict, even before factoring in some of the borderline-bonkers scorelines featuring both teams in other matches this season. A win for Tottenham on Saturday evening would make them overnight leaders of the Premier League and leave City looking uncharacteristically forlorn and out of sorts in mid-table. With Gareth Bale gaining sharpness with every passing day and likely to start in attack for the home side along with the irrepressible Son Heung-min and Harry Kane, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that City will have their work cut out in what seems a genuine test of both sides’ title credentials. José Mourinho is known for his extreme pragmatism, but it is difficult to see his side approach this contest in anything other than a comparatively gung-ho manner with so much attacking talent at their disposal. <strong>BG</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/20/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
