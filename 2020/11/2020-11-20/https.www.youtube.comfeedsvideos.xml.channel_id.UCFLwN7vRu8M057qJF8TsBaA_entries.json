We had 18 or so incredibly talented musicians on the day, all performing. We did about 8 full run-throughs of the Banjo Kazooie theme with 2 cameras filming. A lot of music.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t think there is a harder soundtrack to perform than the Banjo Kazooie theme so we started big. The next video game we\u2019d like to try would be Fall Guys or another Nintendo soundtrack, some high energy music to keep us moving. \n\nWe\u2019d love to make this a regular series where every month we do a different video game theme or soundtrack, it is all down to how much you guys want more of these music videos! \n\nBox 9 Drumline website: http://www.box9d.com/\n\nEdit Workflow by Milo at Speedwagon Productions: www.speedwagon.me\n\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/9PstETG\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/UpIsNotJump \nMerch: https://www.pixelempire.com/products/... \nTwittz: https://twitter.com/UpIsNotJump", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXYacxPVZ3w", "date_published": "2020-11-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
