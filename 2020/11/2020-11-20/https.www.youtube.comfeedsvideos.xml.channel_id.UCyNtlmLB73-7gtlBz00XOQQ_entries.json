During the extremely needed bath, which she hates, I lost control of her head and she managed to latch onto my arm and break the skin with two teeth. It looked kinda rough, so I figured I should get a tetanus shot in the morning. By the time the clinic opened I was in some of the worst pain of my life, the swollen bite looked like a tennis ball was embedded inside my arm, and the selling was pressing constantly against my ulnar nerve.
