Light at the end of the tunnel. Cavalry coming over the hill. End of the beginning and the beginning of the end. In other words, things are looking better for next year.

WHO and remdesivir (20th November)

https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-recommends-against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients

https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-who-advises-against-remdesivir-for-hospitalized-covid-19-patients/a-55671134?maca=en-NL-Corona-Compact

https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/remdesivir.html

Conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients

Regardless of disease severity

Currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes

Guideline, developed by international guideline development group

28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners, one ethicist

Match scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic

WHO Solidarity Trial, 3 other randomized controlled trials

N = 7000

Insufficient evidence of an important effect on: 

Mortality

Need for mechanical ventilation

Time to clinical improvement

Other patient-important outcomes

Supported continued enrollment in trials evaluating remdesivir.

A conditional recommendation

When the evidence around the benefits and risks of an intervention are less certain

In this case, there is a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir

This means that there isn’t enough evidence to support its use.

US pharmaceutical company Gilead

Disputes the findings

WHO's findings were yet to be subjected to peer review

Remdesivir is currently approved for use as a COVID-19 in over 50 countries

Cost

https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4457

A treatment cycle may take 5-10 days

A five day course of treatment for one patient costs around $2340 (£1773; €1976) for government programmes

$3120 for private insurers

Gilead has reached agreements to make cheaper generic versions available in low and middle income countries

(Tamiflu costs less than $75 per course of treatment to shorten symptom duration for patients with influenza)

Hands Face Space and Ventilate

Blacksburg, Virginia

Civil and environmental engineer

Ten feet pace (6 recommended) 

Ventilation

More air flow than recommended by American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers

We don't see outbreaks above a certain threshold

And the gym with the open doors was way above that

Carbon dioxide monitor to track indoor levels

Tape on the floor to mark areas

No wandering around the gym

No partner workouts

Ventilation redesign

A gym trainer exposed 50 

No one else got sick

Some decided to get tested, all tested negative

Followed up for 2 weeks

Prof Andrew Pollard, (Study lead from Oxford)

absolutely delighted with the results

we're seeing the immune responses look exactly the same, even in those who are over 70 years of age

Levels of efficacy

Neutralising antibodies

T cells

not there yet

Data release probably, before Christmas

No competition with other vaccines

Multiple vaccines needed, We will need all of them to protect people around the globe

Moscow is the worst hit area

WHO

Europe, one death every 17 seconds (WHO)

Surge in cases, Europe and the Americas

Countries, case finding, care and isolation, cluster investigations, adequate testing with rapid results, contact tracing and supported quarantine, are facing much less disruption.

Those countries that are letting the virus run unchecked are playing with fire

Further needless deaths and suffering

A significant number of people experiencing long-term effects of the virus

Mental health pressures

Act fast, act now, act decisively

Health being seen as an investment rather than a cost 

A new collective way forward is needed
