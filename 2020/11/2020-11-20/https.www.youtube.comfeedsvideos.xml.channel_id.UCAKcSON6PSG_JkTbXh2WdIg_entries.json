Wild Ponies had a big plan for their 2017 record, \"Galax.\" They could have gone into a nice, plush Nashville studio and recorded it with a few of the town's wonderful session players. Instead, they chose to bring those same players up to their Blue Ridge Mountains hometown of Galax, Va., to play alongside of some of the area's local musical legends. Wild Ponies were so happy with the energy of the sessions that they didn't even bother to listen to the final recordings until they got back to Nashville for mastering.\n\nDoug and Telisha have been playing together since high school, and at least before the pandemic, they remained heavy road warriors. When they were in our area last November for a handful of gigs in the Twin Cities and in southwestern Minnesota, they brought their gear into our studio for this session.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Tower and the Wheel\"\n3:43 \"Bury The Young\"\n7:47 \"Love Is Not A Sin\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nDoug Williams \u2013 guitar and vocal\nTelisha Williams \u2013 bass and vocal\nJack Foster \u2013 drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Mike Pengra\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/11/20/wild-ponies-perform-in-the-radio-heartland-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/RadioHeartlandMPR/\nhttps://twitter.com/RadioHeartland\n\n#wildponies #wildponiesband #galax", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFiELlQmpG4", "date_published": "2020-11-21 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Hippo Campus - three songs at the Palace Theatre (2018)", "description": "Two years ago, Hippo Campus performed back-to-back shows at the Palace Theatre in St. Paul, Minn.
