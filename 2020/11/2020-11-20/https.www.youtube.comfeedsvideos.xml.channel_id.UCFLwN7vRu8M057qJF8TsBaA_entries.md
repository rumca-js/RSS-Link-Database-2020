Arranged and Performed by Box 9, composed by Grant Kirkhope.

I know a lot of musicians, so we decided to try and make a new series where we arrange and perform classic (and new) video game themes, music or soundtracks.

Following my Banjo Kazooie charity live-stream I thought it would be good to start with it’s theme. We had 18 or so incredibly talented musicians on the day, all performing. We did about 8 full run-throughs of the Banjo Kazooie theme with 2 cameras filming. A lot of music.

Honestly I don’t think there is a harder soundtrack to perform than the Banjo Kazooie theme so we started big. The next video game we’d like to try would be Fall Guys or another Nintendo soundtrack, some high energy music to keep us moving. 

We’d love to make this a regular series where every month we do a different video game theme or soundtrack, it is all down to how much you guys want more of these music videos!
