Phil Hornshaw recently spent 16 hours with Cyberpunk 2077 on PC, and answered our burning questions about Johnny Silverhand, ray tracing, and... sex.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a huge game--even though we've been getting lots of looks at its story and gameplay for years now, there's still a lot to uncover. CD Projekt Red gave us one last, lengthy look at Cyberpunk before its December 10 release date, and it covered a lot--from story, to side quests, to sex.

In the video above, Lucy and Jean-Luc's lingering Cyberpunk questions are fielded by Phil, a GameSpot editor who got to spend some 16 hours exploring Night City in CD Projekt's final preview of the game. He spent a bunch of time working through the story, spending time with the characters, hanging out with Johnny Silverhand, and building up the legend of mercenary V through the course of the preview. He also ventured to a Night City red light district to find out what hanky panky is like in Cyberpunk 2077--for science. It was weird.

We've got plenty more Cyberpunk 2077 coverage, including lore deep-dive videos and two big previews based on our 16-hour play session, at GameSpot.com, so be sure to check them out.

Hyrule Warriors is finally out and we're here to break down some extremely useful tips for those who are having a tough time in the fight!

Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity is a prequel to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, but it's a much different sort of game. Like the first Hyrule Warriors, it's a Musuo-style game in the vein of Dynasty Warriors, which means you'll be beating down countless swaths of enemies. But that doesn't mean the action is mindless by any means, and there are some key strategies if you want to really up your combat game.

In the video above, GameSpot's Max Blumenthal runs through some advanced combat tips that will help you make the most of your time with Age of Calamity. The Stasis power from Breath of the Wild returns here, for example, but you don't want to simply spam it whenever possible--there are strategic ways to make use of Stasis to extend the time you have to attack weak points and to stun enemies for longer.

Max also covers the game's wildly powerful Impa, techniques to help if you're having difficulty nailing the timing on parrying or dodging, and why the Magnesis ability is much more powerful than you might think. 

For much more, check out our Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity review. The game is available now on Nintendo Switch.
