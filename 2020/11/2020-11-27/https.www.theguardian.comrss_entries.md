<p>The singer’s online show had a charming Top of the Pops vibe despite its – often star-studded – shortcomings </p><p>Of all the high-profile live streams that have sprung up in lieu of actual gigs in recent months, Dua Lipa’s is, by some considerable distance, the most star-studded. Its list of special guests encompasses everyone from Elton John to FKA twigs to Kylie Minogue: proof, should you need it, of the dominant position the 25-year-old singer currently occupies in pop.</p><p>By common consent, 2020 has been her year, thanks to her second album, Future Nostalgia, which has earned her six Grammy nominations and spawned a succession of global hit singles: the kind of success that even Madonna wants to get involved in, making an appearance on a remix of the single Levitation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/27/dua-lipa-studio-2054-live-stream-review-perfect-escapist-pop">Continue reading...</a>

But the days of the homogenous chicken tikka masala or korma are firmly in the past, as a new breed of restaurateurs have spiced up the nation’s palate with their original thinking and modern perspectives on Indian cuisine. And despite a tumultuous year for the restaurant industry, this culinary revolution shows no signs of abating.</p><p>Think of game-changing Indian restaurants in Britain and a leading contender has to be Dishoom. Inspired by, and putting a fresh twist on, the Irani cafes of Mumbai, it sparked a wave of new restaurants, all bent on pushing boundaries and unearthing the richly-varied culinary lore of India.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/drink-outside-the-box/2020/nov/27/how-darjeeling-express-and-dishoom-put-a-fresh-spin-on-tradition-to-shift-the-tastes-of-modern-britain">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beauty journalist Anita Bhagwandas explains the importance of a minimal approach when it comes to taking care of your skin</p><p>Skincare has been catapulted into stardom over the past few years, from something of a low base. Even as little as 10 years ago, many of us still had relatively pared-back skincare routines. A face wash, usually followed by a toner – even though most of us never actually understood what it did – and moisturiser. And, for a really long time, that would have been considered a fairly extensive routine. But things quickly started to change and we realised our skin needed a little more than that.</p><p>Fast-forward to now and our bathroom shelves have started to resemble a scientist’s lab with vials and potions everywhere. Skincare, which was once simple, has now become a total minefield.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/skincare-gets-gutsy/2020/nov/27/less-is-more-why-you-should-pare-down-your-skincare-routine">Continue reading...</a>

Then he goes home.</p><p>Over the last few years, it is a hobby that has cost him thousands in train fares, a broken ankle, and on one occasion his consciousness, after he was laid out on the turf by a hit.

<p>Want to give your presents a personal touch by making them yourself? Here are 11 ideas for homemade festive offerings</p><p>I recently made a recipe for Somali chicken stew from <a href="https://uk.bookshop.org/books/in-bibi-s-kitchen/9781984856739">In Bibi’s Kitchen</a> by Hawa Hassan and Julia Turshen. It included a spice mix called xawaash, AKA “the garam masala of Somalia”. I plan to make more xawaash and give it to people with an accompanying print-out of a recipe to use it. To make it, you smash a cinnamon stick (in a bag) and heat it in a saucepan with cumin seeds, coriander seeds, black peppercorns, cardamom pods and whole cloves. After a few minutes, leave to cool, then grind to a fine powder before adding turmeric and stirring well. I was apprehensive about the “half a teaspoon” of cloves on the ingredients list, so I just added three. Next time, I’ll be a bit more adventurous. <strong>Belinda Cash, librarian, New York</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/27/from-wearable-blankets-to-fruit-gin-guardian-readers-diy-christmas-gifts">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Available online</strong><br />Directors from the worlds of pop and adverts have made five films for English National Ballet’s new digital season. From boxing women to glorious goths, you won’t know what’s coming next</p><p>A Cuban sugar plum fairy, the undead, a Russian war epic, two women staring each other down in a boxing ring – you never know what’s coming next in English National Ballet’s digital season. The five latest films, wide-ranging in style and concept, average 15 minutes each, making them notably more substantial than most video shorts in the Covid era. It’s an attempt at meaningful choreography as well as visual flair. They will be performed on stage at some point, but for now the films are being released one per week.</p><p>Shot in ENB’s own studio, the works are more filmed dances than dance films but there’s still imaginative use of the space from the directors, who mostly come from commercials and pop videos. The most straightforward is the first, Stina Quagebeur’s Take Five Blues. With warmth and fun, the dancers bounce off violinist Nigel Kennedy’s unconventional recordings of Take Five and Bach’s double concerto. The combination of classical and jazz is reflected in the choreography’s uncomplicatedly attractive angles; it has the mood of improvisation and the precision of a technique class. There’s energy in Shaun James Grant’s direction but it always remains respectful of the choreography.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/27/english-national-ballet-digital-season-review-undead">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The controversy surrounding the original release of this dark exploration of sexy car accidents now seems quaintly outdated – but the film holds up well</p><p>In 1996, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/davidcronenberg">David Cronenberg</a>’s movie Crash, now rereleased in 4K digital, became the subject of the last great “banning” controversy for a new film in Britain. His vision of the erotic car crash got brimstone denunciations from the Evening Standard and the Daily Mail. This delayed its BBFC certificate, and Westminster council issued a solemn edict forbidding it in West End cinemas.</p><p>But in the 21st century, the press appetite for denouncing shocking films just seemed to vanish, overnight becoming the quaint tradition of a bygone age, perhaps because of a belated realisation that these campaigns were destined to fail and didn’t sell papers, and that, increasingly, nothing sold papers in any case as newsprint lost ground to the internet’s oceanic swell, in which all these films could easily be found. Even <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jun/06/human-centipede-sequel-bbfc">The Human Centipede sequel’s brief failure to get a certificate</a> was a formality, laughed or shrugged at.

## The only thing most of us will be wearing this party season is slightly smarter pyjamas | Grace Dent

<p>‘I’ve given up trying to control anything now,’ I announced last Tuesday while breakfasting on a packet of jelly babies</p><p>Food has lost much of its meaning for me. Well, its meanings, to be more accurate. A typical late autumn of eating has its rhythms: shortly after decorative gourd season and past toffee apple weekend (both cancelled due to lurgy), many of us move seamlessly into pre-Christmas hoarding and restraint mode. The hoarding begins with a casually snaffled box of stollen slices or a little bag of Lindt chocolate Christmas tree decorations, chucked into the shopping basket “just to get things started”. Then a shufti around Marks &amp; Spencer’s food hall, where the displays of shortbread in commemorative tin boxes (those nice ones your mother used for her sewing kit) always bring a sense of minor panic that holidays are comin’ and I am unprepared. Begin the lists, open the iCal, commence the slightly terse intra-family emails. Panic!</p><p>I do not have a yuletide shopping delivery slot. That dodgy shelf in my chiller will not survive a fortnight of festive season fridge Jenga, and a better woman than me would have made her own figgy pudding by now. But, as I say, the hoarding won’t happen this year. The big Dent jamboree is cancelled. And the restraint – which runs in parallel from about now to late December – is off, too. About now, I generally have in the diary at least two festive gatherings where I envision myself slinking in wearing some frock that will require me to be a bit hungry for at least 22 days and say things like, “No, I love running five miles pre-dawn dodging flashers – it centres me”, and, “Toast is too filling and carby. I’m so happy with this bircher muesli.” The only thing most of us will be wearing this party season is slightly smarter pyjamas.<br /><br />Life is quite bizarre now that the usual run-up to New Year has been steam-rollered. How empty does late November feel without a low, bubbling, passive-aggressive email chain between siblings about how much room a nut roast takes up in an oven? I feel oddly bereft without any invites to a mock-Bavarian Christmas market where I can drink £8 glasses of glühwein and eat a reheated wurst on the waltzer while listening to David Guetta. This week I noticed the first of the “What to do with Christmas day leftovers” tips and tricks in the papers. The notion of having so many visitors that you might be caught with a glut of food already seems oddly archaic.<br /><br />Buying, planning and hoping for things to run like clockwork is a mug’s game. The rules are that there are no rules. “I’ve given up trying to control anything now,” I announced last Tuesday while breakfasting on a packet of jelly babies. I think it was Tuesday. It may have been Thursday. The Gregorian calendar feels so meaningless these days. Anyway, each baby was so chunkily delicious, and their pudgy little lightly frosted bellies slid so soothingly down my throat, that they felt momentarily like love and order. This one lemon, yum yum. This one raspberry, schlurp.

<p>The Londoner has spent years slogging away in hardman movies, but his latest film is a darkly funny exploration of masculinity. He discusses branching out – and the film’s unsimulated sex</p><p>Craig Fairbrass has made a career from giving a certain type of person exactly what they want. His films have titles such as Deranged and Hijacked and St George’s Day. There are gangsters. There are guns. There are posters that look like a recently divorced dad’s experiments with Photoshop.</p><p>His characters have nicknames that come in inverted commas, like Freddy “Dead Cert” Frankham and Malcolm “Mental Fists” Wickes. The films are usually released to little fanfare and lapped up by a small but dedicated crowd, unnoticed by the rest of the world.<br /><br />Fairbrass’s new film, Muscle, is different. It is extraordinary: a black-and-white exploration of toxic masculinity that is as darkly funny as it is outright horrifying. Fairbrass is remarkable in it, playing a hulking personal trainer who sniffs out a lost loner at a squalid gym and immediately sets about exploiting him for everything he is worth. It is an incredible, committed performance that goes to some unthinkably gruesome places. Remember the shock of seeing <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/jan/16/the-wrestler-film-review">Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler</a> after his wilderness years? We are in that sort of territory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/27/it-took-me-three-days-to-get-over-the-orgy-scene-muscle-star-craig-fairbrass-star-of-muscle">Continue reading...</a>

So is it destined for greatness</p><ul><li><strong>This article contains spoilers</strong></li></ul><p>When the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000pb89">banking drama Industry</a> blared on to our screens earlier this month, one name towered above all others. The first episode was directed by Lena Dunham which, when coupled with its workplace setting, led to a flurry of lazy it’s-Girls-meets-Mad-Men comparisons.</p><p>But as the series wears on – and the entirety becomes available to stream today in the UK and the US – this is looking less and less accurate. Sure, Lena Dunham is involved, but only as a hired hand. This is not her show. And there is none of Mad Men’s languid style here, either. Industry is a show where people hurry through their tasks under the glare of unforgiving strip lights. You cannot imagine anyone ever having an Industry theme night, for example, unless looking stressed to the point of exhaustion suddenly becomes aspirational.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/27/industry-is-the-bbcs-banking-drama-this-life-for-a-new-generation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This year has been horrible in so many ways, but adjusting to normal life again may not be as straightforward as we think<a href="https://app.slack.com/team/U015WT0L7HS"></a></p><p>Most of us can, at any one time, hold conflicting thoughts in our heads; it’s the basic condition of getting anything done. Faced with even the most trivial task, my first response is almost always I don’t want to do it, followed by I do very much want it to be done. To move from one state to the other requires the kind of internal workout – think how good it will feel to be on the other side of this bump; imagine what will happen if I simply stopped doing things; what kind of person can’t deal with the dishes etc – that kicked in particularly viciously last week, with news of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/23/astrazeneca-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-has-70-per-cent-efficacy-covid-oxford-university">Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine</a>. Three oppositional thoughts flew to mind: the end of the pandemic is finally in sight; infection rates will, between now and then, continue to rise and many people will die; and, most confoundingly, I’m not sure I’m ready to go back to the world.</p><p>There is, almost certainly, a compound word in German for the anticipation of future nostalgia. One feels it keenly with children. I look at mine, now, hitting first milestones, and experience a spasm of what feels like loss: the certainty that, at some unspecified time in the future, this period will occupy enormous parts of my hard drive. I will feel sad for what has come and gone. The intensity of this period, so much of which flies by in the scramble just to hang on without falling, will, I know, look different at 10 or 20 years’ distance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/27/vaccine-news-world-year-normal-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I want to use up old pods, not to buy new ones to take part</p><p><strong>A few years ago, my parents bought me a Dolce Gusto coffee machine which I rarely used because the pods could not be recycled. The company has since begun a recycling scheme, so I decided to use what pods I have left. However, the recycling bags are only available if you buy at least 50 more pods. I don’t want more, I just want to avoid putting the ones I already have in landfill. </strong><strong>I wonder if you can help force their hand and prevent further plastic waste?<br /></strong><em><strong>CM, London</strong></em></p><p>Sadly, I can’t. When I questioned Dolce Gusto about its policy it replied, irrelevantly, that its recycling bags are added to all orders on its website. “We hope the activity is a success and at that point we will see how it can be improved and brought to more consumers,” it says. It hopes to make all packaging recyclable by 2025. I asked a second time why customers have to buy more plastic in order to recycle old purchases, but it did not reply. It’s encouraging that the company is trying to make the wasteful process of coffee machines slightly more green, but if it were truly committed it would be taking responsibility for its eco-unfriendly legacy and accept any remaining pods bought before the scheme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/27/bags-of-problems-with-dolce-gustos-recycling-scheme">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An investigation into the Queen Hind sinking a year ago is yet to be published and the live export trade continues to boom</p><p>Romania has been accused of “complete silence” over its investigation into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/25/rescue-mission-for-14000-sheep-on-sinking-ship-abandoned-black-sea">sinking</a> of the Queen Hind last November, which resulted in the deaths of more than 14,000 sheep. <br /><br />Rescuers who rushed to the sinking Queen Hind vessel, which left Romania’s Black Sea port of Midia a year ago, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/28/campaigners-call-for-sheep-saved-from-capsized-ship-to-be-put-out-to-pasture">managed to save</a> just 228 sheep out of a total 14,600, but only 180 ultimately <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/28/campaigners-call-for-sheep-saved-from-capsized-ship-to-be-put-out-to-pasture">survived the ordeal.</a><br /><br />Romania’s prime minister Ludovic Orban vowed on television last year to end live exports in the “medium-term”. However, since the Queen Hind disaster more than <a href="https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/live-export-europe-third-countries-booming-despite-tragedies">2 million live animals</a> have been exported from Romania – mostly to north Africa and the Middle East.</p><p>Romanian authorities have <a href="http://www.ansvsa.ro/blog/precizari-privind-actiunile-specifice-ansvsa-intreprinse-in-cazul-accidentul-din-portul-midia-al-navei-care-transporta-ovine/">claimed the vessel was 10% below capacity</a> and that the animals were “clinically healthy and fit for transport”. But campaigners say the vessel was overloaded and this ultimately led to the thousands of sheep drowning in the Black Sea.<br /><br />The only information to emerge since the sinking has been the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/secret-decks-found-on-ship-that-capsized-killing-thousands-of-sheep">discovery of secret compartments</a> onboard with dead animals inside, by the company hired to remove the ship from the water.<br /><br />Romania’s transport ministry told the Guardian this week that investigations are concluded and said a summary of the report will be published on the ministry’s website. They also said that the purpose of the technical investigation was to establish maritime safety issues and to prevent future accidents, and “not to establish guilt in people involved”.<br /><br />EU law stipulates that investigations into maritime accidents <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32009L0018">should be reported in full within 12 months</a>, but that if a final report is not possible in that timeframe, then “an interim report shall be published within 12 months of the date” of the event.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/27/romania-accused-of-silence-over-ship-that-capsized-killing-14000-sheep">Continue reading...</a>

The familiar image of Madley Croft is as bassist and singer with the xx, the band she formed with London schoolfriends in 2005: dressed in black, shielded by her guitar, expression ranging between pensive and troubled. Even performing a sparkling dance track on stage, such as Loud Places by her fellow wallflower and bandmate Jamie xx (“I go to loud places to find someone to be quiet with,” she sings on the chorus), she stayed largely rooted to the spot.
