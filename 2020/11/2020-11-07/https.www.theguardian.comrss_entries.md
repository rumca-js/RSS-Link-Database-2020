## Soucek's late strike earns West Ham win as Lookman fluffs Fulham penalty

<p>This was a good game until the 90th minute and an exceptional one thereafter. Still 0-0 going into four added minutes, West Ham had time to score a well-worked goal, concede a poor penalty and then watch as Ademola Lookman took a truly awful penalty to blow Fulham’s chance of a point with the last kick of the match.</p><p>West Ham move up to 11th with the win, courtesy of Tomas Soucek’s slammed sidefoot finish from a Said Benrahma cutback. The new Hammers signing, making his home debut, then nipped at the toe of Tom Cairney in the box with just seconds remaining of the game. After a long interaction with VAR a spot kick was awarded and Lookman stepped up to take. He chipped a Panenka so bad that it barely had enough power to bounce off the chest of Lukasz Fabianski. There were cheers and laughter, even in an empty stadium.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/07/west-ham-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

While the four German sides lead or are level on points at the top of their Champions League groups, Spanish clubs are struggling. It is true Barcelona and Real Madrid have specific issues of politics and recruitment, but there is also something more fundamental that can’t be fixed by a new president, a new coach or a new midfield. Last season was the first season since 2007 when there was no Spanish representation in the semi-finals of the Champions League; three of the coaches in the last four were German.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/07/manchester-citys-faltering-press-at-risk-against-klopps-relentless-liverpool">Continue reading...</a>

The chaotic defending has disappeared for now, giving way to greater structure, leaving the stage clear for the wonderfully inventive Hakim Ziyech to provide the ammunition for Frank Lampard’s side to produce a ruthless recovery from a goal down against Sheffield United.</p><p>It might have been a different story last season. Sheffield United played their part during a terrific first half, taking an early lead through David McGoldrick, and did not look like a team languishing at the bottom of the table. Yet it was a breeze in the end, Chelsea stirring after a slow start, showing conviction to fight back before half-time and maturity to keep United at arm’s length before running in late goals from Thiago Silva and Timo Werner.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/07/chelsea-sheffield-united-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As sex lives ebb, the wider world can get more interesting. Robert Dessaix asks, does it really matter if we’re out of the sexual running, even in a society as sex-obsessed as ours?</p><p>If the Roman poet Lucretius is to be believed, the whole universe is “a dance with Venus” – a sexual performance. “Love” just provides some of the footwork for amicable copulation. Or something to that effect. In his day, of course, with high child mortality and a ripe old age far from assured, reproduction must have been at the top of everyone’s list.</p><p>Nowadays, in the west, average life expectancy is much longer than it was in Rome at the beginning of the first millennium – indeed, a quarter of the population where I live can hardly walk in a straight line without assistance, let alone cavort around Venus’s dancefloor – yet we are still fixated as a society on arousal and performance. What is the point of living on into old age in such a society? Why soldier on? Even if you could still dance, who would dance with you?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/08/dalliance-affair-love-intimacy-how-should-we-approach-sex-as-we-age">Continue reading...</a>

Her latest book, <em>Kant’s Little Prussian Head and Other Reasons Why I Write,</em> a collection of essays and reviews from the past 20 years, was published last month.<br /></p><p><strong>What inspired the title of this collection?<br /></strong>The title comes from Thomas Bernhard writing about how Kant is reduced to his “little East Prussian head” but also to a single sentence, a mere philosophical hue. It’s about the fact that we can’t really take in everything we read in a book. When you think about what you remember of a book a month later or a year later, it’s a distillation – sometimes you remember an image or a scene or a moment in the plot, or an idea in an essay. You don’t actively remember the entire experience, at least not consciously. My father used to say that culture is what’s left when you’ve forgotten everything.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/07/claire-messud-to-be-a-writer-is-to-stand-at-the-side">Continue reading...</a>

It happened not a moment too soon. As of 2 November almost <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases">three-quarters of a million new cases</a> have been officially counted since 21 September, when the government’s scientific advisory committee Sage advised lockdown. On that day, Britain had only had about 360,000 cases since Covid arrived. Now the figure is three times that. So many more cases mean it will take longer, and possibly require tougher social restrictions, to get numbers down by imposing lockdown than it would have in September, says James Naismith, head of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford.</p><p>Naismith calculates that we will have 500 deaths per day in two to three weeks because of the cases that occurred over the past week, compared with an average of 144 in the week ending 2 November. But it could be far worse. If we had done nothing for another two weeks, he<strong> </strong>says, we’d be looking at 1,000 deaths a day by Christmas – and more, if hospitals fill up and not everyone can get optimal treatment.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/07/could-a-covid-vaccine-bring-back-normality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Growing up in Tucson, Arizona, in the 1990s, <a href="http://sethbogart.com/">Seth Bogart</a> devoured books and made his own ‘zines’ about riot grrrl, punk and queer culture. These countercultural texts helped him through high school and influence his work as an artist and musician today. He paid homage to them in his recent show, Library Fantasy Vol One , at New York’s <a href="https://fierman.nyc/">Fierman Gallery</a> . ‘It’s like a dream, smutty library or fantasy book store,’ he says. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/nov/07/counterculture-books-modelled-in-clay-seth-bogart-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

My answer: that the US will be a leading country in a post-hegemonic network of democracies.</p><p>Yes, that’s <em>a,</em> not <em>the </em>leading country. Quite a contrast to the beginning of this century, when the “hyperpower” US seemed to bestride the globe like a colossus. The downsizing has two causes: the US’s decline, and others’ rise. Even if Biden had won a landslide victory and the Democrats controlled the Senate, the United States’ power in the world would be much diminished. President Donald Trump has done untold damage to its international reputation. His disastrous record on handling Covid confirmed a widespread sense of a society with deep structural problems, from healthcare, race and infrastructure to media-fuelled hyper-polarisation and a dysfunctional political system.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/07/what-will-president-bidens-united-states-look-like-to-the-rest-of-the-world">Continue reading...</a>

A wealthy African American, one-time member of the Communist party and producer and co-host of local current affairs talk show <em>Input</em>, Stokes was also a former librarian and a bit of an obsessive who was fascinated by the news and its dissemination. Her Philadelphia apartment contained several TVs, each set up with a video recorder so that she wouldn’t miss a second of the 24-hour news cycle. The tapes would then be labelled with Post-it notes and filed for later use.</p><p>Documentary film-maker <a href="https://media.gutools.co.uk/images/8132fca816a44f57b88b546c0251a24e0a9bf0ef">Matt Wolf</a> captures the breadth and significance of Stokes’s vast archive without getting bogged down. <em><a href="https://recorderfilm.com/">Recorder</a> </em>includes events such as the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis and the Sandy Hook massacre in 2012. One brilliant scene cleverly splits the screen into a grid of four squares to show how 9/11 was reported in real time by different channels.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/07/recorder-the-marion-stokes-project-review-matt-wolf">Continue reading...</a>

I went to the Holocaust camps. I did a lot of deep research, which was pretty heavy in my teens. But it was something I needed to resolve to understand why I was being bullied.

<p>(BMG)<br />In these dark days, Kylie steps up and delivers a shimmering stream of dancefloor bangers</p><p>It feels increasingly cruel that in a year when the New Normal dictates we all keep as far away from each other as possible, pop’s best practitioners have delivered sweaty dancefloor fillers. It started with Dua Lipa’s album <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/05/dua-lipa-future-nostalgia-review">Future Nostalgia</a></em> and its fusion of sleek dance-pop and disco decadence, before Lady Gaga took us off to the post-EDM clubs of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/06/lady-gaga-chromatica-review-colour-kindness-and-connection">Chromatica</a></em><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/06/lady-gaga-chromatica-review-colour-kindness-and-connection"> </a></em>after a few years of dabbling with guitars, “authenticity” and Mark Ronson. Following suit is Kylie – surname be damned! – who has eschewed the six-string instruments and stetsons of 2018’s country-leaning <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/17/kylie-minogue-live-review-cafe-de-paris-golden-album">Golden</a> </em>in favour of something much sparklier on her 15th album.</p><p>Being bombarded with wall-to-wall bangers at a time when mainlining ITV’s <em>The Cube</em> constitutes a big night is frustrating, but the efficiently titled <em>Disco </em>is saturated in Kylie’s supernatural mix of high camp and total sincerity. Taking its cues from 1970s and 80s disco, all buffed staccato strings, lithe rhythm guitar and gold-plated choruses, the album works both as the soundtrack to an escapist glide around your kitchen or, on songs such as opener Magic and the timely lead single Say Something (“can we all be as one again?”), a heartfelt wallow in heightened emotions. Mainly written and recorded during lockdown, with Minogue engineering her vocals from a makeshift home studio, it comes with its own anti-working-from-home anthem in the shape of the sashaying, conga-line ready Monday Blues.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/07/kylie-minogue-disco-review">Continue reading...</a>

But who is its secretive puppet master? <br /></p><p>One Sunday in August, two weeks after Belarus’s authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko declared an implausibly decisive victory in presidential elections, I joined a crowd of around 100,000 people as it moved through central Minsk. Protest in Belarus was no longer the domain of a few hundred hardy opposition figures, and the homemade placards many people carried illustrated how broad the coalition had become: “Let’s drink to love, from the bartenders of Belarus”; “Teachers against violence”; “Working class, go on strike!”</p><p>The previous fortnight had been a time of national awakening, as the country united around the goal of ending Lukashenko’s 26 years in charge. As grim footage of police violence circulated on the messenger app Telegram, large numbers came out to demand that their voices be heard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/nov/07/nobody-can-block-it-how-telegram-app-fuels-global-protest">Continue reading...</a>

She’d buy a little one all for herself, loving the fact that she didn’t have to share it with anyone.

<p>The award-winning crime writer on how the plot of the novel that became ITV’s hit series Wire in the Blood arrived, fully formed, while she was driving on the M6</p><p>By 1994, I’d published seven crime novels and I’d been writing full-time for three years. The first two years, my writing had been a tax loss. I’d only stayed afloat because of the redundancy money I got when I quit my job. But things were slowly improving thanks to my agent’s assiduous sales of foreign rights and the occasional library event. I had two series characters – Scottish journalist Lindsay Gordon and Manchester PI Kate Brannigan, but although the settings and preoccupations of the books were contemporary and feminist, structurally they were well within the traditions of the genre.</p><p>I was living on the edge of the West Pennine moors, in a quiet suburban street that did not feel like home to me. For most of the time I was writing <em>The Mermaids Singing</em>, I was desperately trying to sell the modern bungalow that my ex had talked me into buying. One sunny morning, I was driving home down the M6, half-listening to <em>Woman’s Hour</em>, enjoying the rolling curves of the Howgill Fells, when a plot popped fully-formed into my head. I knew what the story was, who the killer was, who the victims were, how the events unfolded and who the protagonists were. It was profoundly shocking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/07/val-mcdermid-the-mermaids-singing-felt-like-a-narrative-emergency">Continue reading...</a>

The pace of change has slowed and this time around the advances are less immediate and more subtle, more like tinkering under the bonnet: better resolution, higher frame rates, shorter loading times, smoother online features. Look at a PS5 game next to one from its predecessor, the PS4, and – unless you have a giant expensive TV and sound system – you might not immediately see the difference. It will take a few years for the creatives behind blockbuster games to unlock these machines’ full capabilities. But whoever gains early ground in the console war gets a bigger say in the future of gaming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/nov/07/video-games-battle-for-control-ps5-playstation-v-xbox">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In an exclusive new poem and essay Margaret Atwood reflects on the passing of time and how to create lasting art in a rapidly changing world</p><p><em>Read Dearly by Margaret Atwood</em></p><p>I can say with a measure of certainty – having consulted my poor excuse for a journal – that my poem “Dearly” was written in the third week of August 2017, on a back street of Stratford, Ontario, Canada, with either a pencil or a rollerball (I’d have to check that) on some piece of paper that may have been anything from an old envelope to a shopping list to a notebook page; I’d have to check that as well, but I’m guessing notebook. The language is early 21st-century Canadian English, which accounts for the phrase “less of a shit”, which would never have been used in, for instance, Tennyson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/apr/14/poemoftheweek34">“In Memoriam AHH”</a>; though something like it might have appeared in one of Chaucer’s more vernacular tales – “lesse of a shitte”, perhaps. This poem was then taken out of a drawer, its handwriting more or less deciphered by me, and typed as a digital document in December 2017. I know that part from the date and time identifier on the document.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/ng-interactive/2020/nov/07/caught-in-times-current-margaret-atwood-on-grief-poetry-and-the-past-four-years">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Campaigners say visit was ‘media propaganda’ as officials failed to stop at any devastated rainforest areas</p><p>Environmentalists have criticised a three-day tour of the Amazon that the Brazilian government staged for foreign ambassadors as a “sham” and “media propaganda” after it failed to stop at any environmentally devastated areas. </p><p>The tour ended on Friday and focused on better-protected areas of the northern Amazon. “The government prepared an itinerary that does not show the reality of the Amazon – the abandonment of indigenous peoples, the land grabbing, the illegal mining and the uncontrolled deforestation. It is a sham,” said Marcio Astrini, executive director of the Climate Observatory, an umbrella group of environmental NGOs. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/07/green-groups-denounce-brazils-sham-amazon-tour-for-foreign-diplomats">Continue reading...</a>

This was recommended to me as a cure for certain occupational ailments, including neck pain, back pain and shoulder pain. The first time I reached across my desk for a pencil and ended up on the floor, I thought: this isn’t going to work.</p><p>But it does work. My neck has stopped hurting, my shoulders don’t ache and my core is permanently engaged. I rarely fall off the ball any more.
