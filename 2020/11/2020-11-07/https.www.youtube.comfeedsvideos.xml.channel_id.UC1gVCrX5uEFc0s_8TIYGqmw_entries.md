Stevedore is a person employed, or a contractor engaged, at a dock to load and unload cargo from ships.
Alexandre Promio who operated camera, picked this angle for a good reason. At first we think that workers are the main subject of this movie. But it is the smoke that director indented to capture. For cinema audience at the time, natural movement was as interesting as human beings.
