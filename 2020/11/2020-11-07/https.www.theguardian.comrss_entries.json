So many more cases mean it will take longer, and possibly require tougher social restrictions, to get numbers down by imposing lockdown than it would have in September, says James Naismith, head of the Rosalind Franklin Institute in Oxford.</p><p>Naismith calculates that we will have 500 deaths per day in two to three weeks because of the cases that occurred over the past week, compared with an average of 144 in the week ending 2 November. But it could be far worse. If we had done nothing for another two weeks, he<strong> </strong>says, we\u2019d be looking at 1,000 deaths a day by Christmas \u2013 and more, if hospitals fill up and not everyone can get optimal treatment.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/07/could-a-covid-vaccine-bring-back-normality\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/07/could-a-covid-vaccine-bring-back-normality", "date_published": "2020-11-07 17:00:16+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Counterculture books modelled in clay \u2013 in pictures", "description": "<p>Growing up in Tucson, Arizona, in the 1990s, <a href=\"http://sethbogart.com/\">Seth Bogart</a> devoured books and made his own \u2018zines\u2019 about riot grrrl, punk and queer culture.

Quite a contrast to the beginning of this century, when the \u201chyperpower\u201d US seemed to bestride the globe like a colossus. The downsizing has two causes: the US\u2019s decline, and others\u2019 rise. Even if Biden had won a landslide victory and the Democrats controlled the Senate, the United States\u2019 power in the world would be much diminished. President Donald Trump has done untold damage to its international reputation.
