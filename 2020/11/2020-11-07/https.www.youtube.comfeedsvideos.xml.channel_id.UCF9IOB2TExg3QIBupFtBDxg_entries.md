Measures to reduce the spread of the virus in North Jutland

Hjørring, Frederikshavn, Brønderslev, Jammerbugt, Vesthimmerland, Thisted and Læsø, 

where many citizens are infected with a new version of the coronavirus from minks

All positive tests will be sequenced

WHO report, SARS-CoV-2 mink-associated variant strain – Denmark (6th November)

https://www.who.int/csr/don/06-november-2020-mink-associated-sars-cov2-denmark/en/

Since June 2020

214 human cases with SARS-CoV-2 variants associated with farmed minks

Five different strains of mutant mink coronavirus in the 214 people

5 November

12 cases with a unique variant

All 12 cases were identified in September 2020 in North Jutland, Denmark

Same virus confirmed from mink

Whole genome sequencing

Unique combinations of mutations

Cases were 7 to 79 years

Eight had a link to the mink

Four cases were from the local community.

Variant, "cluster 5" variant

Combination of new mutations

Moderately decreased sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies

Minks to Minks to people to people to Minks

Species spill over, genetic modifications in the virus

Other Mink cases

Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Italy, United States

Danish authorities

Culling of all farmed mink (more than 17 million) in Denmark

Enhancing surveillance of the local population to detect all COVID-19 cases

Population-wide mass PCR testing for the region of North Jutland

Expanding the percentage of sequencing of human and mink SARS-CoV-2 infections in Denmark

Rapid sharing of the full genome sequences of the mink-variant SARS-CoV-2 and

Introducing new movement restrictions

Unknowns

Diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines in development

WHO advice

Further virological studies

Transmissibility and the severity of disease it causes

Advises all countries to increase the sequencing

Open publications

Enhance surveillance for COVID-19 at the animal-human interface

WHO, Reducing risks

Avoiding close contact with people suffering from acute respiratory infections

Ensuring frequent hand-washing, especially after direct contact with ill people or their environment

Practicing cough etiquette

Enhancing standard infection prevention and control practices in hospitals in health care facilities, especially in emergency departments

Update on the Danish mutation and a flattening of cases in the UK
Denmark

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54851042

Has locked down some areas

Self-isolation for return announced on Friday

UK has imposed an immediate ban

UK nationals or residents can return, to isolate, with all members of their household for 14 days

Announced at 02.00 Saturday

Applies from 04.00 Saturday

World Health Organization, it is too early to jump to conclusions

1) The northwestern part of Denmark where the infected mink are, is under lockdown and people cannot enter/leave the region

2) There are no cases of the mutation in the eastern part of Denmark where Copenhagen is located.

3) Denmark has decided to be much more responsible in reporting this mutation widely and early in order to avoid the situation in China where alarms were not sounded appropriately.

The more rigorous we are, the shorter the lockdown will be

The situation is very serious - the second wave is here and it is violent
