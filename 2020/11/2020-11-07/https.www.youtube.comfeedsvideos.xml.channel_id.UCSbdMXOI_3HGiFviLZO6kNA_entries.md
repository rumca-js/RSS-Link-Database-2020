Today I will be conducting a torture test on the Oculus Quest 2 and the Elite Battery Headstrap. I'm going to do my best to replicate real life scenarios to see just how robust this headset is. Drop tests, lens scratch tests, controller tests, and of course.. putting it into a dryer. So, does the Quest 2 survive?
