One of these is the new Pulse 3D headset.\u00a0\n\nWe've had a chance to try it out, and in a new video review, Mat Paget makes the case for it. The top-line takeaway is that the Pulse 3D headset produces vibrant audio at an affordable price. The headset works with not only the PS5, but a number of other platforms.\n\nThe $100 headset boasts a 12-hour battery life, and we found that to be true in our tests. Overall, for the price, the headset delivers a very rich audio experience. The only negatives we had to mention were that its plastic frame feels cheap and it may not be the most comfortable for larger ears.\u00a0\n\nCheck out the full review in the video above, and keep coming back to GameSpot for lots more on the PS5 and other next-gen news in the days and weeks ahead.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2rlSzOiI9g4", "date_published": "2020-11-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS4 Pro vs PS5: Ghost Of Tsushima", "description": "Want to know how much of a difference a PS5's optimization patch adds to your PS4 games? Check out this comparison of Ghost Of Tsushima, running on PS4 Pro and PS5 with the latest patches.\n\nMuch has been made about the PlayStation 5's backwards compatibility with PlayStation 4 games. Sony has confirmed that 99% of all PS4 games will play on its new system, but some titles will be receiving patches to optimize the experience.\n\nOne such title is 2020's Ghost of Tsushima, which already looked stunning on PlayStation 4. It's been optimized for PS5, taking full advantage of Game Boost, with an option in the game to allow frame rates up to 60fps. In the above video, we compare the PS4 version of the game running on a PS4 Pro to the PS5. Both were captured in resolution mode.\u00a0\n\nFor more on the PlayStation 5, including in-depth looks at its backwards compatibility, as well as reviews for its launch games like Astro's Playroom and Spider-Man: Miles Morales, keep your eyes peeled to GameSpot.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYMxguFD5Lw", "date_published": "2020-11-08 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "PS5 DualSense Controller\u2019s Best Features", "description": "With adaptive triggers and haptic feedback inside, the DualSense offers new opportunities for PS5 gameplay and connecting what's on screen to the controller in your hand. But it has to be used for more than just Astro's Playroom.\n\nThe PlayStation 5 sports faster load times and improved graphics over its predecessor, but its controller is the thing you're probably going to notice most as you dive into your next-generation gaming experiences. The DualSense sports a bunch of improved technology, from its adaptive triggers to its dynamic haptic feedback, that elevate the games that use it well.\n\nThe best showcase for the DualSense we've seen so far is Astro's Playroom, the 3D platformer that comes bundled with the PS5. It uses every speck of capability the DualSense offers, showing off its enhanced rumble features with feedback based on what surfaces you're walking on and what actions you're taking, changing the tension of the adaptive triggers to mimic what Astro is doing on screen, and adding the touchpad, microphone, and gyroscope into the mix to amplify them all.\u00a0\n\nCheck out the video above for our impressions of the DualSense--including why we're a bit worried about its long-term prospects.

Some are hidden deep in menus but are well worth seeking out, like setting your camera, subtitle, and difficulty preferences at a system level to automatically apply to games that support it. There are also cool new changes to Trophies, and additions to Profiles, like the Accolade system and being able to see how much playtime you've put into a game. We also point out hidden PlayStation symbols on the DualSense controller and on the PlayStation 5 console itself.\u00a0\n\nThere are cool tweaks to the Game Library, how you store PS4 games, and changes to your screenshots and video clips.

Check out the video above to see the differences in load times.\n\nWe compared the PS5 to the PS4 Pro's internal hard drive, and in a lot of cases, the difference was pretty stark.
