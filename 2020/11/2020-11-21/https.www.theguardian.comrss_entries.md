<p>Manchester United finally have a Premier League victory at Old Trafford and a second consecutive win in the competition, though they far from convinced. Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side benefited from three decisions regarding two penalties and Slaven Bilic was understandably disappointed at the majority of the officiating here from David Coote, the referee, and VAR.</p><p>Each occurred in the second half and centred on Bruno Fernandes and Conor Gallagher. In the first the former was adjudged by Coote to have fouled the latter and the referee awarded a spot-kick. Yet VAR informed the official to consult the pitchside monitor and, after this, he reversed his decision, ruling that it was clear and obvious Fernandes took the ball before touching Gallagher.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/21/manchester-united-west-brom-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tottenham suffocated a possession-hungry Manchester City in a fascinating tactical contest between two old foes</p><p>You know, this might just catch on. For an hour at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium the white shirts of Spurs and the all-blacks of Manchester City played out a game of such familiar contrasts, possession v non-possession, that it felt like watching a sporting remake from the Legends Tours, Tyson v Holyfield or Benn v Eubank.</p><p>Perhaps the best thing about José v Pep is that it remains so completely itself. Football may be in a state of constant refinement at the top end. But these two, not so much. So we got Davis v Higgins in north London – and beyond that an evening where Mourinho’s counterpunching Spurs exposed with a brutal clarity the weak points in this City team. A few years back Guardiola referred to Tottenham as “the Harry Kane team” with a raise of the eyebrows, a puff of the cheeks and a pat on the head. Well, Pep, you asked for it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/21/jose-mourinho-pep-guardiola-tottenham-manchester-city">Continue reading...</a>

On Christmas Day each year, wherever they were, Glenn would lug out a hulking, prewar metal projector and set up an old slide screen. The family would then gather round, the children in pyjamas with a bag of popcorn, and listen to stories they had heard “a bazillion times”.</p><p>I wanted my hand to be in there… it links the series and I wanted my past and present to be physically linked</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/nov/21/photographer-catherine-panebianco-lensculture-critics-choice-winner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After living with Parkinson’s for 30 years, the actor still counts himself a lucky man. He reflects on what his diagnosis has taught him about hope, acting, family and medical breakthroughs</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/06/michael-j-fox-sitcom-parkinsons-alcoholism-divorce" title="">last time I spoke to Michael J Fox</a>, in 2013, in his office in New York, he was 90% optimistic and 10% pragmatic. The former I expected; the latter was a shock. Ever since 1998, when Fox went public with his diagnosis of early-onset Parkinson’s disease, he has made optimism his defining public characteristic, because of, rather than despite, his illness. He called his 2002 memoir <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/lucky-man-9780091885670.html" title="">Lucky Man</a>, and he told interviewers that Parkinson’s is a gift, “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/apr/11/michael-j-fox-parkinsons" title="">albeit one that keeps on taking</a>”.</p><p>During our interview, surrounded by the memorabilia (guitars, Golden Globes) he has accrued over the course of his career, he talked about how it had all been for the best. Parkinson’s, he said, had made him quit drinking, which in turn had probably saved his marriage. Being diagnosed at the heartbreakingly young age of 29 had also knocked the ego out of his career ambitions, so he could do smaller things he was proud of – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,346295,00.html" title="">Stuart Little,</a> the TV sitcom Spin City – as opposed to the big 90s comedies, such as Doc Hollywood, that were too often a waste of his talents. To be honest, I didn’t entirely buy his tidy silver linings, but who was I to cast doubt on whatever perspective Fox had developed to make a monstrously unjust situation more bearable? So the sudden dose of pragmatism astonished me. Finding a cure for Parkinson’s, he said, “is not something that I view will happen in my lifetime”. Previously, he had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOhBtTYfSE4" title="">talked about finding “a cure within a decade</a>”. No more. “That’s just the way it goes,” he said quietly. It was like a dark cloud had partly obscured the sun.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/21/michael-j-fox-every-step-now-is-a-frigging-math-problem-so-i-take-it-slow">Continue reading...</a>

My sister Maya called, saying the doctors didn’t think Toot [Obama’s grandmother] would last much longer, perhaps no more than a week. She was now confined to a rented hospital bed in the living room of her apartment, under the care of a hospice nurse and on palliative drugs.

Maya was waiting for me when I arrived at Toot’s apartment; I saw that she had been sitting on the couch with a couple of shoeboxes of old photographs and letters. “I thought you might want to take some back with you,” she said. I picked up a few photos from the coffee table. My grandparents and my eight-year-old mother, laughing in a grassy field at Yosemite.

<p>Sheer tints give enough colour to feel pulled together, without risk of smudging</p><p>I miss lipstick. Or rather, I miss it in the outside world. At home, I now wear it constantly, such is my thirst for cheerful colour during these dark times. But when I’m on the move, a once-essential product has become problematic.</p><p>The feeling of lipstick against mask is distracting and unpleasant. Most lipsticks leave kiss prints on fabric, and lose definition from the friction. The overall effect is the opposite of lipstick’s usual upscaled smartness and ultimately seems more trouble than it’s worth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/nov/21/face-masks-and-lipstick-do-not-mix-try-these-tinted-balms">Continue reading...</a>

## We're already getting Christmas ads – did 2020 run away from us? | Candice Carty-Williams

<p>It seems the festive period has begun – but I just want another couple of weeks to accept that the year is almost over </p><p>The festive holiday adverts have started. When did companies decide that mid-November was the time to kick off the festive period? Has it always been this way? This year, I decided that I’m not going to watch any of these advertisements until December. Obviously, the luckier of us don’t have much going on in our lives currently, and there’s not a huge amount to look forward to <em>as yet</em>, so this way I get to eke out any pre-festivity enjoyment come the actual month of Hanukah, Kwanzaa and Christmas.</p><p>Only one advert has snuck before my eyes, for the e-commerce website Etsy, which surprised me. It started playing on Twitter and by the time I went to pause it, I was halfway through and my eyes had already welled up with tears. I decided to finish watching because I hadn’t had my daily cry and I wanted something to tip me over the edge. Maybe I’m too strict on myself when it comes to wanting proper demarcation of the seasons, or maybe subconsciously, for now, I’m eschewing the anxiety of having to buy gifts for my friends and family. Either way, I’m aware that 2020 has run away from all of us. I just want another couple of weeks to accept that. And another couple of weeks to plan what books I’ll be buying people for the holidays.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/21/were-already-getting-christmas-ads-did-2020-run-away-from-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Eva Green’s career-best performance as a single-mother astronaut is an ideal launchpad for a look at cosmic adventurers from Jane Fonda to Juliette Binoche</p><p>For too long in the movies – as in life – space exploration was presented as a boy’s realm: brave, lantern-jawed men soaring off to the final frontier while their wives waited and fretted on terra firma. A recent spate of films and TV series have redressed the balance, putting women at the centre of their stargazing narratives – few more stirringly than <strong><a href="https://proxima.film/">Proxima</a></strong> (multiple platforms), a superb astronaut character study from the French director Alice Winocour that gives <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/03/eva-green-penny-dreadful-witch-golden-compass-casino-royale-camelot">Eva Green</a> the role of her career.</p><p><em>Proxima</em> got a UK cinema release in July, but amid pandemic uncertainty never found the audience it deserved. Now, <a href="https://proxima.film/">VOD</a> should serve as a reintroduction to a film that combines compelling space-station activity with a frank, straightforward feminist message. Green plays Sarah, an ambitious astronaut and single mother surprised to receive a last-minute invitation to join a European Space Agency mission to Mars – the realisation of a lifelong dream, but one that necessitates a year spent apart from her eight-year-old daughter Stella (the delightful Zélie Boulant).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/21/streaming-the-best-women-in-space-movies-proxima-single-mother-astronaut">Continue reading...</a>

## William S Burroughs and the Cult of Rock’n’Roll by Casey Rae review – countercultural hero

<p>From Bowie to Cobain, heavy metal to Blade Runner – how the Naked Lunch author changed pop culture <br /></p><p>The writer William Burroughs was a fringe figure until his 50s, too weird for popular tastes. Part of the original trio of Beat writers alongside Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg, he was at once feted and condemned for his work – his 1959 novel <em>Naked Lunch</em> was briefly banned by the city of Boston following an obscenity trial; Norman Mailer testified in its defence. But in the late 60s and 70s, a new generation of musicians turned him into a countercultural hero, among them Paul McCartney, Lou Reed, David Bowie, Richard Hell, Jimmy Page and Patti Smith.<strong> </strong>Later on, Michael Stipe, Kurt Cobain and Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore would all declare themselves in Burroughs’ thrall.</p><p>Casey Rae surveys his impact on musicians and how his thumbprints can be found all over popular culture. The film <em>Blade Runner</em> took its title from a Burroughs novella, and the band Steely Dan was named after a dildo in <em>Naked Lunch</em>. The term “heavy metal” was taken from <em>The Soft Machine</em>, Burroughs’s 1961 book that also provided a jazz-folk fusion band from Canterbury with their name. His face looks stonily from the cover of the Beatles’ <em>Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, and he lent his creaky drawl to albums by Laurie Anderson, Tom Waits and the Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy. Elsewhere, Burroughs’ “cut-up” methods – a literary technique where the text is randomly rearranged – were adopted by Bowie, McCartney and the Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/21/william-s-burroughs-and-the-cult-of-rocknroll-by-casey-rae-review-countercultural-hero">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Drawing on memories of epic journeys can help sustain us through lockdown. Experts share their greatest conquests – and where they plan to go next<br /></p><p>For a start, there was all the preparation: I spent every evening for several weeks running up the 55 steps of York’s Clifford Tower carrying a rucksack full of tinned dog food. It was just the thing to start forming some powerful memories, essential if a trip is going to be laid down as “the ultimate”. The load was meant to toughen me up for high-altitude exertion: I was planning an ascent of Ecuador’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/jan/23/mountain-climbing-chimborazo-ecuador">Mount Chimborazo</a>, a 6,263-metre summit that sits on the equator and is the furthest a human being can get from the centre of the Earth without flying.</p><p>When I got to Ecuador, however, and went out for my first walk, at about 3,000 metres above sea level, I suddenly passed out. Had I forgotten to take the Chappie cans out of my bag? No. Maybe I wasn’t fit enough? Doubts crept in. The next step was to climb Cayambe, a 5,790-metre volcanic peak east of Quito: this task now took on an extra frisson of excitement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/nov/21/10-adventurers-trip-of-a-lifetime-adventure-travel-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Don’t wear a fitness tracker, plan your route so there are fewer junctions and remember you won’t get up any speed wearing tweed</p><p>If you have any sort of journey to work at the moment, it’s likely you will have thought about a bicycle commute. And likely, if you have, you’ve concluded that it’s a little bit longer than you’d prefer (otherwise you’d have been doing it all along) and that you need to dangle some reward in front of yourself, such as, “It’ll make me really fit.” (Meanwhile, if you’re working from home for lockdown, you may be eyeing up your bike as a means of escaping reality, and getting fit at the same time.)</p><p>The truth is, cycling to work is in a different league from club cycling. It may cheer you up, count as moderate exercise and be better than nothing, but it won’t hugely boost your fitness levels for the following three reasons: you go slowly so you don’t get sweaty and ruin your work clothes; you endlessly stop and start, because of traffic lights; you only use your leg muscles, rather than your core or arms (and you only use half your leg muscles at that).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/21/fit-in-my-40s-cycling-will-cheer-you-up-this-lockdown-but-will-it-get-you-fit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The author of Shuggie Bain talks about growing up in Glasgow in the 80s, the dangers of ‘poverty safari’ and what he’ll do now he has won the prestigious literary prize</p><p>As a boy in working-class Glasgow, one of the ways Douglas Stuart learned to cope with his alcoholic mother’s mood swings was to pretend to write her memoir. They never got very far, but it always began with the dedication: “To Elizabeth Taylor, who knows nothing about love.” And so the seeds were sown for his debut novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/aug/09/shuggie-bain-by-douglas-stuart-review-lithe-revelatory-debut">Shuggie Bain</a>, which was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/19/douglas-stuart-wins-booker-prize-for-debut-shuggie-bain">awarded the Booker prize this week</a>.</p><p>“I never thought, using that trick 40 years ago, I’d be here talking to you about my book,” the author says on a Zoom call from New York, where he has lived for the last 20 years. Instead of the usual smart dinner at London’s Guildhall (Barack Obama <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/12/barack-obama-to-take-part-in-2020-booker-prize-ceremony">made an appearance</a> at the virtual ceremony), Stuart is tucking into a plate of ham and cheese his husband has made for him. He may have a celebratory glass of champagne later. “All these wonderful things keep happening and I’ve never left the sofa,” he says of life in lockdown. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/21/booker-winner-douglas-stuart-i-owe-scotland-everything">Continue reading...</a>
