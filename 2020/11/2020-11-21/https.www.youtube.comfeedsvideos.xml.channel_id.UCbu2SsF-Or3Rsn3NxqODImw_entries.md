Assassin's Creed: Valhalla is full of strange history, so we've broken down some of the most interesting periods where the Vikings roamed the lands of Mercia, Wessex and beyond.

Assassin's Creed: Valhalla takes players to England, Norway and even beyond, but while the world is stunningly rendered both on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, there's a lot of secrets hiding within the virtual British Isles where most of the game takes place. 

Even the names of in-game enemies Eivor takes on offer some hints to some peculiar parts of English history, and may potentially link the world to the future DLC, Wrath of the Druids.

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, are both in the same franchise, but are two very different shooter experiences. How does Cold War compare to 2019's Modern Warfare, and which one is the better game?

Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is the latest game in Activision's first-person shooter series, and it takes the franchise back to the 1980s for a period-set shooter full of espionage thrills. But how does it compare to the previous game in the series, 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare?

In the video above, Dave Jewitt and Richie Bracamonte compare the two games across three topics: multiplayer, campaign, and the battle between the Spec Ops and Zombies modes. From a multiplayer standpoint, Cold War provides a more arcadey Call of Duty experience compared to the Battlefield-inspired action of Modern Warfare.

Dave and Richie also break down the two games' single-player campaigns and discuss the merits of Black Ops Cold War's replayability versus Modern Warfare's rejuvenation of the Call of Duty campaign. And finally, the pair compare the maligned Spec Ops mode from Modern Warfare with Black Ops Cold War's Zombies mode, discussing which of the two modes they prefer.

Phil Hornshaw recently spent 16 hours with Cyberpunk 2077 on PC, and answered our burning questions about Johnny Silverhand, ray tracing, and... sex.

Cyberpunk 2077 is a huge game--even though we've been getting lots of looks at its story and gameplay for years now, there's still a lot to uncover. CD Projekt Red gave us one last, lengthy look at Cyberpunk before its December 10 release date, and it covered a lot--from story, to side quests, to sex.

In the video above, Lucy and Jean-Luc's lingering Cyberpunk questions are fielded by Phil, a GameSpot editor who got to spend some 16 hours exploring Night City in CD Projekt's final preview of the game. He spent a bunch of time working through the story, spending time with the characters, hanging out with Johnny Silverhand, and building up the legend of mercenary V through the course of the preview. He also ventured to a Night City red light district to find out what hanky panky is like in Cyberpunk 2077--for science. It was weird.

We've got plenty more Cyberpunk 2077 coverage, including lore deep-dive videos and two big previews based on our 16-hour play session, at GameSpot.com, so be sure to check them out.
