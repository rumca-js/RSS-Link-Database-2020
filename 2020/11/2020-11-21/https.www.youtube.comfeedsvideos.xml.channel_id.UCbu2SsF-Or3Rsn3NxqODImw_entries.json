How does Cold War compare to 2019's Modern Warfare, and which one is the better game?\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops Cold War is the latest game in Activision's first-person shooter series, and it takes the franchise back to the 1980s for a period-set shooter full of espionage thrills. But how does it compare to the previous game in the series, 2019's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare?\n\nIn the video above, Dave Jewitt and Richie Bracamonte compare the two games across three topics: multiplayer, campaign, and the battle between the Spec Ops and Zombies modes. From a multiplayer standpoint, Cold War provides a more arcadey Call of Duty experience compared to the Battlefield-inspired action of Modern Warfare.\n\nDave and Richie also break down the two games' single-player campaigns and discuss the merits of Black Ops Cold War's replayability versus Modern Warfare's rejuvenation of the Call of Duty campaign. And finally, the pair compare the maligned Spec Ops mode from Modern Warfare with Black Ops Cold War's Zombies mode, discussing which of the two modes they prefer.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8s6pe7Y1q0", "date_published": "2020-11-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "16 Hours With Cyberpunk 2077: Here's Everything We Did", "description": "Phil Hornshaw recently spent 16 hours with Cyberpunk 2077 on PC, and answered our burning questions about Johnny Silverhand, ray tracing, and... sex.\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is a huge game--even though we've been getting lots of looks at its story and gameplay for years now, there's still a lot to uncover.

He spent a bunch of time working through the story, spending time with the characters, hanging out with Johnny Silverhand, and building up the legend of mercenary V through the course of the preview. He also ventured to a Night City red light district to find out what hanky panky is like in Cyberpunk 2077--for science.
