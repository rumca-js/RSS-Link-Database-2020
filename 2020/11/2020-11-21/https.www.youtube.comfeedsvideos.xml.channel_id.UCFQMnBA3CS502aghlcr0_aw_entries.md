this video is an opinion and in no way should be construed as statements of fact. scams, bad business opportunities, and fake gurus are subjective terms that mean different things to different people. I think someone who promises $100K/month for an upfront fee of $2K is a scam. Others would call it a Napolean Hill pitch.

will they take it? 
The Space Force $2 Bill is a bizarre find, it's a privately created bill, and they make it by printing on a film to a regular $2 bill. I found it odd to think that anyone could make any type of colorized bill they wanted, so I put it to the test. Do people treat the Space Force Bill like legal tender?
