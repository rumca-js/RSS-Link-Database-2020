Analysis of Measles-Mumps-Rubella (MMR) Titers of Recovered COVID-19 Patients

https://mbio.asm.org/content/11/6/e02628-20

The measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine

Theorized to provide protection against coronavirus disease

To determine whether any MMR IgG titers are inversely correlated with covid severity

Comparing MMR titers to recent COVID-19 severity levels.

The MMR II group

50 subjects who would primarily have MMR antibodies from the MMR II vaccine

Comparison group

30 subjects consisted of those who would primarily have MMR antibodies from sources other than MMR II

Including prior measles, mumps, and/or rubella illnesses

Results in the MMR group

Significant inverse correlation (rs = −0.71, P less than 0.001) 

Between mumps virus titers and COVID-19 severity

Results in the comparison group

There were no significant correlations between mumps IgG titers and severity in the comparison group

Results in both groups

No correlation between between severity and measles or rubella titers in either group

Scale of the observation

Mumps titers of 134 to 300 arbitrary units (AU)/ml (n = 8), functionally immune or asymptomatic

Less than 134, (n=17) all had mild symptoms

Less than 75, (n=11) all had moderate symptoms

Less than 32, all who had been hospitalized and had required oxygen

Our results demonstrate that there is a significant inverse correlation between mumps titers from MMR II and COVID-19 severity

Four important points

Young children are largely spared from severe disease

Second, numerous countries have COVID-19 death rates that are as low as 1% of the death rates of other countries

Many people, despite prolonged close contact with someone who is COVID-19 positive, never test positive themselves

Nearly half of people who test positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic

Mechanism of action

Sequence homology between both mumps and measles and rubella with SARS-CoV-2

After two doses

97% protected against measles

88% against mumps

97% against rubella

Light at the end of the tunnel. Cavalry coming over the hill. End of the beginning and the beginning of the end. In other words, things are looking better for next year.

WHO and remdesivir (20th November)

https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/who-recommends-against-the-use-of-remdesivir-in-covid-19-patients

https://www.dw.com/en/coronavirus-who-advises-against-remdesivir-for-hospitalized-covid-19-patients/a-55671134?maca=en-NL-Corona-Compact

https://bnf.nice.org.uk/drug/remdesivir.html

Conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir in hospitalized patients

Regardless of disease severity

Currently no evidence that remdesivir improves survival and other outcomes

Guideline, developed by international guideline development group

28 clinical care experts, 4 patient-partners, one ethicist

Match scientific standards with the speed required to respond to an ongoing pandemic

WHO Solidarity Trial, 3 other randomized controlled trials

N = 7000

Insufficient evidence of an important effect on: 

Mortality

Need for mechanical ventilation

Time to clinical improvement

Other patient-important outcomes

Supported continued enrollment in trials evaluating remdesivir.

A conditional recommendation

When the evidence around the benefits and risks of an intervention are less certain

In this case, there is a conditional recommendation against the use of remdesivir

This means that there isn’t enough evidence to support its use.

US pharmaceutical company Gilead

Disputes the findings

WHO's findings were yet to be subjected to peer review

Remdesivir is currently approved for use as a COVID-19 in over 50 countries

Cost

https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4457

A treatment cycle may take 5-10 days

A five day course of treatment for one patient costs around $2340 (£1773; €1976) for government programmes

$3120 for private insurers

Gilead has reached agreements to make cheaper generic versions available in low and middle income countries

(Tamiflu costs less than $75 per course of treatment to shorten symptom duration for patients with influenza)
