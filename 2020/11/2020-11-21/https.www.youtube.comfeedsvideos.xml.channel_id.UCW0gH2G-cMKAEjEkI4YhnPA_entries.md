Treebeard the Ent, also known as Fangorn is one of the oldest beings in Middle-earth.  Today, we track his life from the Years of the Trees through the First, Second, and Third Ages.  From the Ents battle with Beren against a group of dwarves, to their tragic separation from the Entwives, to their attack on Isengard - we cover it all!
