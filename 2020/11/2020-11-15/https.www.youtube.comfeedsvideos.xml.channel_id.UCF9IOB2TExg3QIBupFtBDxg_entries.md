Pfizer /  BioNTech, 90 % 

https://www.pfizer.com/news/press-release/press-release-detail/pfizer-and-biontech-announce-vaccine-candidate-against

N = 43,538 participants

94 people infected so far

People catching COVID, starting 2 weeks after second shot

No data on disease severity

Food and Drug Administration, 50 % to be approved

Moderan trial

Double blind

4 weeks between shots

25,650 participants have received two shots

37 % from communities of color

42 % from populations high risk, (over 65 or diabetes, obesity, heart disease)

95 people contracted the virus, 11 of these had severe disuses

No children

Adolescents soon, moving on to children

Moderan vaccination group

5 people contracted coronavirus

Moderna control group (salty water)

90 people contracted coronavirus

11 of whom had severe disease

Differences between groups was highly significant

Results analyzed by independent data safety monitoring board (appointed by the National Institutes of Health)

Results were so strong; company felt an ethical obligation to offer the vaccine to the placebo group as soon as possible

Dr. Anthony Fauci

I had been saying I would be satisfied with a 75 % effective vaccine

Aspirationally, you would like to see 90, 95 %, but I wasn’t expecting it. 

I thought we’d be good, but 94.5 percent is very impressive.

Both vaccines

More cases have acetated results

Studies continuing

Target the spike protein

Require 2 shots

Not found serious side effects

Sore arms, fatigue, fever and joint and muscle aches that last for a day or two

Vaccine storage and transport

Different formulations of lipid 

Moderna

Minus 20’C (- 4 Fahrenheit) 

Will last 30 days in the refrigerator

Ordinary freezer, six months

12 hours at room temperature

Pfizer

Minus 70’ C (- 94 Fahrenheit)

Roll out

Both about to apply for emergency FDA authorization

Roll out, Moderna

20 million doses ready by end of 2020

500 million to one billion doses in 2021

Manufacture in US, Switzerland, Spain

Two-month follow-up safety data, as (required by FDA), second half of November

i.e. watch trial subjects for two months after they receive a final dose for any side effects that may crop up

Then, will file for an emergency use authorization

Government authorising agencies, Britain, Canada, Europe

US, 100 million with options on 400 million more

EU, 80 million doses

Japan, 50 million doses

Canada, 20 million

Switzerland, 4.5 million

UK orders 5 million doses for spring

Qatar and Israel

In talks with the WHO, COVAX, distribution and a tiered pricing proposal

Roll out, Pfizer

50 million doses by end of 2020

US, 100 – 500 million doses

EU, 200 million doses

UK, 40 million doses

AZ / Oxford

EU, 400 million doses

UK, 100 million

Vaccines alliance for poorer countries, 300 million



Costs, Sanofi and GSK

Both expected to cost about £8 a dose

AZ / Oxford

£ 3 per dose


Costs, Moderna

US, government will buy, free to the public

US warp speed, already put in 2.5 billion, $24.80 a shot

Both companies making a profit

Moderna, overseas charge, $32 to $37 per dose

Probably about £42 per course

Costs, Pfizer

Operation Warp Speed has promised Pfizer $1.95 billion to provide 100 million doses

$19.50 per dose.

## Hands, face, space AND Ventilate

Hands, Face, Space, Ventilate

Five ways to avoid catching the virus indoors

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53917432

If it's stuffy, walk away

Dr. David Davies, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers

If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. 

You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected.

Look up at the air conditioning

Split air conditioner

If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any

One person infects 9 in China

Ask about the 'fresh air ratio'

Prof Cath Noakes, Leeds, Environmental panel, SAGE

Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing

The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building

Get the office management to check if there's virus in the filters

Is there someone shedding in the building?

South Korea, 11th floor, one person infects 90

Watch out for draughts
An infected person sitting by an open window or ventilation source
Downwind effect
Dilution effect outweighs the risk
Viral dilution

Pfizer / BioNTech n RNA vaccine

UK, 10 million does this year, 30 million more ordered

Two doses, 3 weeks apart

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54949799

Professor Uğur Şahin (immunologist)

Founder of the firm

No serious side effects

We did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study

Key side effects

Pain in the injection site for a few days

Some participants, mild to moderate fever for one or two days

We did not see any other serious side-effects which would result in the pausing or halting of the study

So far, the safety profile seems to be absolutely benign

The next few months

This winter will be hard

We will not have a big impact on infection numbers

300 million doses by April 2021

This will start the impact

Biggest effect summer 2021

Must have a high vaccination rate by autumn / winter 2021

Normal winter next year

Will the vaccine prevent viral transmission?

I'm very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine

maybe not 90% but maybe 50%

but we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread

How long will immunity last?
Antibody response in patients, will decline over time
Booster immunisation should not be too complicated
