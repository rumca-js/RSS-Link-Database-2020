With AMD's release of the 5000 series of CPUs, it was only a matter of time our cryo cooled  Intel system would be dwarfed. But we WERE NOT expecting this system From Digital Storm to grace us. It is glorious.

Thanks to LG for sponsoring this video! Check out the LG OLED CX48 TV at https://bit.ly/32CXRBB 

Xbox Series X and Series S have a few key differences in GPU processing power (TFLOPS), storage, and RAM- but how do these differences manifest in-game? We do some side by side comparisons using Assassin's Creed Valhalla to find out, and we're using the LG OLED CX48 TV as the display since it's a 4K OLED TV giving amazing picture quality and HDMI 2.1 for ultra-fast refresh rates. It's the perfect TV for console gaming! You can purchase it here: https://bit.ly/32CXRBB
