if any\n\nOne person infects 9 in China\n\nAsk about the 'fresh air ratio'\n\nProf Cath Noakes, Leeds, Environmental panel, SAGE\n\nHaving 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing\n\nThe more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building\n\nGet the office management to check if there's virus in the filters\n\nIs there someone shedding in the building?\n\nSouth Korea, 11th floor, one person infects 90\n\nWatch out for draughts\nAn infected person sitting by an open window or ventilation source\nDownwind effect\nDilution effect outweighs the risk\nViral dilution\n\nIf you would like to donate to this educational project, please use the following link, thank you, https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=78GGHGLK5ZXAE", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8K4y7ROCqc", "date_published": "2020-11-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCF9IOB2TExg3QIBupFtBDxg", "title": "The next COVID year and vaccine function", "description": "Pfizer / BioNTech n RNA vaccine\n\nUK, 10 million does this year, 30 million more ordered\n\nTwo doses, 3 weeks apart\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54949799\n\nProfessor U\u011fur \u015eahin (immunologist)\n\nFounder of the firm\n\nNo serious side effects\n\nWe did not see any other serious side effects which would result in pausing or halting of the study\n\nKey side effects\n\nPain in the injection site for a few days\n\nSome participants, mild to moderate fever for one or two days\n\nWe did not see any other serious side-effects which would result in the pausing or halting of the study\n\nSo far, the safety profile seems to be absolutely benign\n\nThe next few months\n\nThis winter will be hard\n\nWe will not have a big impact on infection numbers\n\n300 million doses by April 2021\n\nThis will start the impact\n\nBiggest effect summer 2021\n\nMust have a high vaccination rate by autumn / winter 2021\n\nNormal winter next year\n\nWill the vaccine prevent viral transmission?\n\nI'm very confident that transmission between people will be reduced by such a highly effective vaccine\n\nmaybe not 90% but maybe 50%\n\nbut we should not forget that even that could result in a dramatic reduction of the pandemic spread\n\nHow long will immunity last?\nAntibody response in patients, will decline over time\nBooster immunisation should not be too complicated\n\nIf you would like to donate to this educational project, please use the following link, thank you, https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=78GGHGLK5ZXAE", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smm_ZvJqJk4", "date_published": "2020-11-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
