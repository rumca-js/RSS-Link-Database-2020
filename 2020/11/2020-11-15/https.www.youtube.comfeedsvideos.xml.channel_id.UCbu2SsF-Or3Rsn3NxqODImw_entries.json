In fact, there's only 667 GB of precious storage for your games. Given that some AAA titles regularly clock in over 100 GB (we're looking at you, Call of Duty), and PlayStation 5 games can't be moved onto an external hard drive, let alone be played from one, that's going to fill up fast.\n\nSSD storage is coming for the PlayStation 5 eventually, but it's not available at launch, so in this video, we give you our top tips to save space on your console. From specific Trophy settings to turn off to game prioritization to, crucially, ensuring that you're putting your PlayStation 4 games on a USB hard drive, there are many things you can do to get the most out of your PlayStation 5's internal storage.\u00a0\n\nWe have plenty of features about the PlayStation 5 up on GameSpot, including a roundup of hidden features that you'll definitely want to check out, as well as in-depth looks and reviews of its launch lineup.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL_z7L0Z79w", "date_published": "2020-11-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Console Evolution: Xbox To Series X", "description": "Remember When Halo Almost Wasn\u2019t An Xbox Game: https://youtu.be/noE49iZ9Reg\n\nIn this video, Kurt chronicles the journey of Microsoft\u2019s daring foray into the gaming industry with the Xbox through its many missteps, to its crowning achievements. Starting all the way back in 1998 with the console\u2019s conception, the Xbox was the brainchild of Seamus Blackley, and entered the gaming market competing head on with Sony\u2019s astronomically successful PlayStation 2. While going toe-to-toe with the PS2 was a steep uphill battle, Microsoft still managed to place itself among its contemporaries as a worthy competitor, outselling Nintendo\u2019s GameCube that generation.\n\nFor the Xbox 360, Microsoft came out swinging a whole year ahead of the PS3 and Wii, and while that head start was pivotal to the console\u2019s success, the 360 still faced many challenges along the way--most notably the infamous Red Ring of Death dilemma. Still, by the end of its lifespan, the Xbox 360 was hugely successful, and set the bar high for what was to come with the Xbox One. Unlike the Xbox 360, the Xbox One was a major misstep for Microsoft, but one that ultimately led to a historical change of course that that has led the company to its current vision and values heading into this next generation with the Xbox Series X/S. With Xbox on the cusp of its fourth generation, it\u2019s suffice to say that story is far from over.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcBg9GykSFU", "date_published": "2020-11-16 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Assassin\u2019s Creed Valhalla vs Odyssey: Which Is Better?", "description": "Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Assassin's Creed Odyssey: both in the same franchise, but two very different games. Does Valhalla build upon the franchise\u2019s new formula, introduced in Origins and honed by Odyssey, or does it give fans a different experience.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is the latest game in Ubisoft's open-world series, and it continues the franchise\u2019s new RPG formula from the Ancient Greece-set predecessor, Assassin\u2019s Creed Odyssey. But how does Valhalla compare to Odyssey?\u00a0\n\nIn the video above, Jordan Ram\u00e9e and Lucy James compare the two games across three topics: gameplay, world and setting, and story and characters. From a gameplay standpoint, Valhalla streamlines many of Odyssey\u2019s loot-heavy mechanics, while returning the series to its roots by bringing back elements such as social stealth and the hidden blade.\u00a0\n\nLucy and Jordan also break down the two games' settings: Viking-era England, and Ancient Greece, and discuss which title best represents its historical location. And finally, they discuss Valhalla and Odyssey\u2019s central protagonists, comparing fan-favourite Kassandra with the new assassin on the block, Eivor.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1l-EYUPIew", "date_published": "2020-11-15 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Ray Tracing Explained For PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC", "description": "PC gamers have been able to play with it for a little while, but ray tracing has finally come to consoles with the Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. But what exactly is ray tracing and should you really care about it?\n\nRay tracing has been around for PC gamers for some time, but with the power behind the Xbox Series X|S and the PS5, it\u2019s now an option for console gamers too. But what exactly is ray tracing?\n\nIn the video above, we walk you through the basics of the tech that's on everyone's minds right now. In simple terms, ray tracing casts out and calculates linear rays of light between in-game light sources and the player\u2019s eye. It's used to simulate realistic reflections, refractions, and shadows, which can create a more immersive and photorealistic gaming experience, but at the sacrifice of your game\u2019s frame rate. We discuss the use of ray tracing in recent games such as Watch Dogs: Legion, which has come under fire for how it's handled the lighting system.\u00a0\n\nGames that currently have plans to introduce ray tracing on console systems include Halo Infinite, Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, NBA 2K21, Devil May Cry Special Edition on Xbox Series X/S, and Demon\u2019s Souls Remastered.
