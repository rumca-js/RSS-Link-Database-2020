The alpine hunters are the elite mountain infantry force of the French Army. They are trained to operate in mountainous terrain and in urban warfare. First corps were created in 1888.

This particular boxing is called Savate, a French kickboxing combat sport that uses the hands and feet as weapons combining elements of English boxing with graceful kicking techniques.
