## Twilight Zone review  – like a leisurely ride on the Hogwarts Express

<p>The mildly disappointing Jordan Peele reboot used this episode to revisit the adolescent experience with a tale with a twist, but no real moral </p><p>It was inevitable that Jordan Peele’s Twilight Zone reboot (Sky One) would get around to enrolling in high school at some point. As Peele’s narrator says in his introduction to this mid-season episode, “It’s a period that for most of us already feels like a waking nightmare”. Add to that the rich genre tradition of dark dormitory corridors and suspicious substitute teachers for TZ’s writers to draw on. Watching Among the Untrodden often felt like a leisurely ride on the Hogwarts Express, sandwiched between your old school bullies.</p><p>The company only accounts for so much on these journeys to another dimension. That is one of the mostly unheeded lessons of the last series, when Peele’s on-screen collaborators included the eminently likable, if not universally adored, Tracy Morgan, Chris O’Dowd and Better Call Saul’s Rhea Seehorn. Even so, their performances sometimes felt thrown away on lacklustre plots and half-hearted conceits. Season two hasn’t given up this ploy of borrowing from the goodwill audiences feel for its guest stars – Christopher Meloni, Gretchen Mol and George Takei are still to come – but this episode, at least, featured mostly unknown actors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/03/the-twilight-zone-review-like-a-leisurely-ride-on-the-hogwarts-express">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester City have a maximum nine points in a group stage that is going perfectly. Factor in a fine display from Ferran Torres at centre-forward and Gabriel Jesus’s goal-scoring appearance as a substitute following a long lay-off and Pep Guardiola was left pleased. His team are rolling along impressively, showing signs of the formidable force they can be.</p><p>After this victory over Olympiakos a draw in the reverse fixture in Greece guarantees passage to the knockout phase. “We need one more point to qualify,” Guardiola said. “Now we have four or five days to recover well, have one day off, and prepare for Liverpool [on Sunday]. It is good news that Gabriel is back. And, in the first half, we were really good.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/03/manchester-city-olympiakos-champions-league-group-c-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Tate Modern, London</strong> <br />With provocative images of lesbian empowerment and gender play, the photographer celebrates the resilience, style and creativity of South Africa’s queer community</p><p>A woman clasping her hands over her jockey shorts, protecting her privacy in the aftermath of rape. The long scar running down her leg is evidence of an even earlier assault. In another image, hospital bracelets tether their wearer to the hate crime that led them here – rape, assault, GBH. These jolts, from Zanele Muholi’s 2002-06 series <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/muholi-id-crisis-p81289">Only Half the Picture</a> are leavened by other kinds of intimate images in the opening room of <a href="https://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/zanele-muholi">Tate Modern’s survey of the artist’s work</a>. An indolent face looks back, with a half-opened mouth spilling smoke into the air. In another the artist looks down, photographing the mug of coffee on the floor, resting between slippered feet.

<p>In an emotional interview the midfielder reflects on the pain of losing baby Louie and why he is speaking out</p><p>When Oliver Norburn stepped off the bench at Fratton Park in September, for the final minutes of the first game of the season, hardly anyone knew another battle was at play, anguish running through his veins. Three days earlier he rushed to the Royal Bolton hospital after his pregnant fiancee, Lucy, called in tears when a routine 20-week scan indicated difficulties. “On the way back [from Portsmouth] things were playing on my mind and I just wanted to get home,” he says. “We went to see a specialist on the Monday and it was just awful news. Me and my missus had a little bit of time together and on the Thursday she had to give birth, which was tough.”</p><p>That day Norburn cradled baby Louie for the first and last time. For almost an hour he speaks with enormous strength, detailing an exhausting episode from an executive box overlooking the New Meadow pitch. There are tears and moments of silence, when only the groundsman’s mowing can be heard, but Norburn’s first answer, an attempt to unpack the past few weeks, is four minutes’ long; he stresses the brilliance of the midwives on the ward, the ceaseless strength of his partner and wanting to fight on for Shrewsbury Town, as captain of the League One club. When his sentence ends, his lips quiver and his voice cracks. “Better out than in … [you’re] one of the first people I’ve cried to,” he says, with the smallest of smiles.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/03/shrewsbury-oliver-norburn-my-son-is-shining-down-on-me-i-can-do-him-proud">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Getting better from this chronic disease is much easier for those with a safety net </p><p>In early March I suddenly fell sick: a fever, breathlessness and muscle aches. I followed the advice at the time, which was to stay at home and call 111 if needed. It wasn’t possible to get tested, but I rested and tried not to panic about feeling unable to breathe. I started getting better, but then I stopped getting better and began feeling worse. Within a few weeks I was mentally and physically frayed, unable to do any more than sit up in bed.</p><p>While most people recover from Covid-19 in the expected two-week period, there are many for whom the ill health brought on by the virus persists.

<p>Miming used to be the epitome of pop fakery. But in the age of TikTok, it has become a creative and lucrative artform in its own right<br /></p><p>On 19 November 1990, the National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences in the US revoked a Grammy award for the first (and so far, only) time. Pop duo Milli Vanilli were disgraced after music producer Frank Farian revealed the pair hadn’t sung a single note on their multi-platinum 1989 album, Girl You Know It’s True. Frontmen Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus were great dancers, sure, and they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdSmokR0Enk">looked great in their oversized shoulder pads</a>. But the duo had lip-synced their way to success. In the span of nine months, Milli Vanilli went from the world’s official best new artist to the (handsome) faces of music history’s biggest hoax.</p><p>It’s not quite a Grammy, but in October 2020, TikToker <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@addisonre?lang=en">Addison Rae Easterling</a> was nominated for a People’s Choice award. The 20-year-old American is a great dancer, sure, and looks great in oversized gold hoops. But Easterling has also lip-synced her way to success. In her one year on TikTok, the influencer has mouthed along to songs by Nelly Furtado, SZA and Katy Perry. She now has 65 million followers, a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5t5hv8vHAxUN8v6ft6meAC">weekly podcast</a> and her own <a href="https://www.itembeauty.com/">cosmetics line</a>. The big difference, of course, is that Easterling didn’t deceive anyone; she’s one of 800 million active users who mime along to soundbites on the TikTok app. But you can’t help but feel Morvan and Pilatus – who were in their mid-20s at the time – would’ve fared much better 30 years on, in the TikTok era.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/03/rehabilitation-of-lip-syncing-tiktok-bella-poarch-rupaul">Continue reading...</a>

## AFC Wimbledon's Plough Lane return: 'There was just an irresistible pull'

<p>Almost 30 years after Wimbledon left SW19, AFC Wimbledon will host Doncaster Rovers at the new Plough Lane on Tuesday<br /></p><p>For AFC Wimbledon’s manager, Glyn Hodges, Tuesday night’s long-awaited return to Plough Lane will be particularly poignant. Hodges was part of the Wimbledon side that shook up the football establishment in the 1980s, rising from the depths of the fourth tier to the top flight before famously lifting the FA Cup a year after his departure for Newcastle United in 1987.</p><p>After the then owner, Sam Hammam, sold Plough Lane to developers in 1991, the club endured a nomadic existence for more than a decade until they relocated to Milton Keynes in 2003. AFC Wimbledon were formed by supporters opposed to the move and almost three decades on from the last Wimbledon match in Merton, the opening of a 9,000-capacity stadium 250 metres from the old ground is the culmination of a remarkable journey. Doncaster Rovers are the visitors for a League One match.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/03/afc-wimbledon-plough-lane-return-irresistible-pull">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PlayStation 5 (forthcoming), Xbox Series X/S (forthcoming); Ubisoft</strong><br />This ambitious, imperfect and unashamedly weird game attempts to simulate an entire population</p><p>Video games have become extraordinarily adept at simulating geography, from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/30/epic-video-games-self-isolating">Assassin’s Creed</a>’s detailed, architecturally accurate takes on ancient Egypt or 18th-century Paris to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/aug/18/microsoft-flight-simulator-review-asobo">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>’s virtual simulacrum of the Earth’s surface. But they are still no good at simulating people, and their cities are populated with reactive automatons who forget you tried to run them over two seconds ago. This makes Watch Dogs Legion’s attempt to simulate the entire population of a futuristic, technocratic London one of the most ambitious things a game has tried in years. Walk from Camden to Nine Elms and every person you see has a name, a cluster of attributes (gambler, fashion expert, paramedic, low mobility) and a custom-generated voice and appearance. You can recruit any of them to your hacker resistance movement and step into their shoes.</p><p>I played most of Watch Dogs Legion as a construction worker named Hassan. He has no particular special skills; he can summon a cargo drone and ride it up to rooftops, but he hasn’t got any useful weapons or technical expertise. I picked him because he was nearby, and I liked his haircut and accent: not too EastEnders, not too plummy. But then I accidentally took Hassan into the bowels of one of Watch Dogs Legion’s autocratic tech giants, on a mission that I thought would be easy but turned out to involve hiding in a vent from heavily armed private security guards while using a spiderbot to steal encrypted information. Hassan barely escaped with his life. I became rather attached to him after that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/nov/03/watch-dogs-legion-review-fight-fascism-in-a-futuristic-london">Continue reading...</a>

## Not a Novel by Jenny Erpenbeck – refreshingly frank and incisive

<p>The German author reflects on borders, memory and her East Berlin childhood in a collection of essays shot through with anger</p><p>When the Berlin Wall fell, German author Jenny Erpenbeck was oblivious. In her essay Homesick for Sadness, she tells us: “I literally slept through that moment of world history, and while I was asleep, the pot wasn’t just being stirred, it was being knocked over and smashed to pieces.” Erpenbeck was initially sceptical about East Berlin’s newfound liberty. “<em>Freedom</em> to travel? (But will we be able to afford it?) Or <em>freedom</em> of opinion? (What if no one cares about my opinion?) <em>Freedom</em> to shop? (But what happens when we’re finished shopping?).” Later, she admits that her experience of this “transition” was what prompted her to write.</p><p>Erpenbeck’s refreshing frankness and incisive thinking permeate this collection. Written over two decades, <em>Not a Novel</em> includes snapshots of a happy childhood in the German Democratic Republic, literary criticism on writers she admires (including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/23/hans-fallada-thriller-surprise-hit">Hans Fallada</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/06/guardianobituaries.secondworldwar">Walter Kempowski</a>, Thomas Mann and Ovid) and meditations on her own work as a writer. We learn of her love of folk tales, how their “intensity” and “harshness” infiltrate her own fiction, and how music (she worked as an opera director) taught her “to give shape to the gaps between the words, those mute spaces, to give rhythm to the silence between the words. The pauses are part of the text, they may be the finest part…”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/03/not-a-novel-by-jenny-erpenbeck-refreshingly-frank-and-incisive">Continue reading...</a>

Despite living in flat, cyclist-filled places for most of my 45 years, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/oct/21/familyandrelationships.family5">I am terrified of bicycles</a>: oily, capricious bringers of danger, humiliation and mashed shins.

The streets are quiet, the erratic kids on scooters are back at school and there will never be a better time to face my fears.</p><p>I can grasp the basic mechanics of how to make the pedals go round, but my abysmal coordination and balance mean that I have the dubious distinction of being the only person I know to have failed their cycling proficiency test. The memory of an embarrassed, incredulous maths teacher pulling me out of the flowerbed into which I had fallen (I was attempting the part of the test where you have to look over your shoulder to manoeuvre) is one of those scenes that replays on a loop in my mind on sleepless nights. I feel like the only adult alive who can’t ride a bike, but I don’t think I am.

<p>From Bond girl to badass grandmas, Tsai Chin has had an extraordinary career. She talks about her battles with racism, predatory producers – and farting leopards</p><p>‘I have lived on my own since 1963,” says Tsai Chin down the phone from her home in Los Angeles. “It doesn’t mean I haven’t had a sex life.” But it does mean that the 88-year-old actor brings something special to her latest role as a beguilingly irascible, chain-smoking widow who faces down triad thugs over stolen money in the comedy Lucky Grandma. Apart from the smoking, Grandma Wong is my new role model.</p><p>“I’m tough but my heart is very soft,” she says. And that is the key to Grandma Wong, a woman who projects to the world the opposite of what she is inside. In the film, she has a shrine to her late husband in her meagre Chinatown apartment in New York. She’s alone and impoverished but isn’t quite ready to give up her independence and move in with her sweet if bougie son in his brownstone.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/03/tsai-chin-bed-sean-connery-bond-girl-lucky-grandma">Continue reading...</a>

## Life during wartime: how west Belfast became the frontline of the Troubles

<p>Acts of state violence, and repeated official denials, drove some Northern Irish Catholics to armed resistance. But not everyone in west Belfast supported the IRA’s methods</p><p>When Johnston Brown, a 27-year-old detective with the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) – the overwhelmingly protestant police force of Northern Ireland – volunteered in late 1977 to serve at Andersonstown police barracks in Catholic west Belfast, he was given a few pieces of very clear advice. He should never stop at a red light in west Belfast if it was safe to drive on. He should assume that any pedestrians who wanted to cross the road may be part of a trap – members of the security forces had lost their lives this way. Nor should Brown ever indicate that he was turning into a police barracks. He should approach with the flow of the traffic and then swerve suddenly in through the gates, to reduce the risk of being shot, and to make it harder for anyone to make a note of his registration number. And if he were unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of gunmen, he must attempt to shoot his way out – never try to talk himself out of trouble.</p><p>“I remember clearly,” Brown wrote in 2005, “one older detective sergeant, a man in his late 40s, telling me sternly: ‘Here you have at most between five and eight minutes at the door of any house you may call at on an enquiry. You have that much time to conduct the enquiry and get the hell out of those areas, because five to eight minutes is all the time it takes for the Provos [<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/aug/22/psni-provisional-ira-northern-ireland-kevin-mcguigan-republican" title="">the Provisional IRA</a>] to get hold of a weapon and a volunteer who will be only too keen to kill you before you conduct your enquiry and leave.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/nov/03/life-during-wartime-how-west-belfast-became-the-frontline-of-the-troubles">Continue reading...</a>

## The fall of Johnny Depp: how the world's most beautiful movie star turned very ugly

<p>In the 1990s, he was a different kind of film star – eloquent, artistic and cool. But this week, with the loss of his court case against the Sun, the dream has decisively soured<br /></p><p>Johnny Depp is “a wife-beater”. This is the verdict of the UK courts. Just writing that sentence feels genuinely shocking, and yet, by now perhaps, it should not. For a start, the allegation that he was physically abusive to his ex-wife Amber Heard emerged more than four years ago, after <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/johnny-depp-amber-heard-relationship-timeline-b40070.html]">she applied for a temporary restraining order</a> against him following their divorce, citing domestic abuse. It should also not be a shock, given how many other hugely famous men have been accused of abusing women. Sean Connery was alleged to have beaten his first wife and frequently defended hitting women. His death this weekend sparked<strong> </strong>online arguments about how much the coverage should focus on the professional achievements of a man who repeatedly insisted it was fine to hit women, “if the woman is a bitch, or hysterical, or bloody-minded continually”, as he said in 1965.</p><p>But Depp is a very different figure from Connery. The latter represented alpha masculinity and aggressive sexuality. No one ever said it explicitly, but Connery’s defences for beating women fit in, on some level, with his image, and so that side of him was never going to be a problem with his audience. Depp, however, represented something else. He sued the Sun for defamation when it described him as “a wife-beater”, something Connery would never have done, and it’s why for a certain kind of fan (me), this feels like the death of yet another childhood hero.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/03/the-fall-of-johnny-depp-how-the-worlds-most-beautiful-movie-star-turned-very-ugly">Continue reading...</a>
