Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBobby Carter | November 4, 2020\nThe backdrop for Polo G's Tiny Desk (home) concert is a nod to his deep love for the game of basketball. He and his band perform in Los Angeles Lakers jerseys on an outside court in California, with Polo G repping one of the greatest Lakers, Magic Johnson.\n\nThe man born Taurus Bartlett has achieved quite a bit for a relative newcomer in hip-hop. This summer he was selected for XXL's popular Freshman Class cover. His second LP, The Goat, debuted at No. 2 on Billboard's Hot 200 and spawned two platinum-certified singles, including the braggadocious \"Flex\" that kicks off his Tiny Desk.\n\nPolo G's eyes are hidden behind his hair for the majority of his performance, but as he sings \"I'm so sick of farewells and RIPs\" on his latest single, \"Epidemic,\" it becomes clear that this 21-year-old Chicago emcee is going through a lot. I found it refreshing to hear a rapper normally backed by beats bare his \"heart and soul\" with a live band.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Flex\"\n\"Epidemic\"\n\"Wishing For A Hero\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nPolo G: vocals\nLamar Edwards: keys\nVasjon Hill: drums\nAustin Cain: bass\nChris McCorkle: guitar\nShaunise Harris: vocals\nCandice Boyd: vocals\nNava Morris: vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo Director: Ramez Silyan\nAudio: Irvin Picott and Anthony Jerome Culpepper Jr.\nVideo Producer: Mike Lev\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Bobby Carter\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mt8-QwG8dXM", "date_published": "2020-11-04 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
