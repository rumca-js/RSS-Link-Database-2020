Hello and Welcome to, TUESDAY NEWSDAY! Today we have a crazy episode in the week of VR news, from Crysis VR leaks, broken Oculus Quest 2 headstraps, Sony dissing their own VR system, and most important of all, the Stanford study on biometric/ tracking data in identifying a people. Its good, but also a little scary.
