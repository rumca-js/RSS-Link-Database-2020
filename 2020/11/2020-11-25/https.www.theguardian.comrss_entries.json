The goal was to build a system that could track individual interactions across an entire population, in an effort to get a head start on isolating potentially infectious carriers of a disease that, as the world was discovering, could be spread by asymptomatic patients.</p><p>Delivered at breakneck pace, the resulting exposure notification tool has yet to prove its worth.

Eric Tabuchi and Nelly Monnier talk us through their vast photographic atlas</p><p>From the industrial north to the sun-baked south, Eric Tabuchi has spent two decades scouring the landscape of France with an obsessive eye. In 2008, the Danish-Japanese-French photographer created a beguiling series called Alphabet Truck by sneaking up on 26 different articulated lorries on the move and photographing the single giant letter adorning each one\u2019s rear, from A to Z. In 2017, he made Atlas of Forms, a 256-page guide to all the shapes, from pyramid to polygon, the world\u2019s buildings are based on.

Monnier and Tabuchi are slowly making their way around the country, arriving in each area with a minimum of preconceptions.
