Beautiful image composition with static foreground and moving background. This is a classic framing technique in modern cinema, but in case of Lumiere its a testament of his great skill.

Original video was processed with Deep Learning algorithms to achieve modern look and quality. Here is the process:

1. Footage stabilization and noise/dust/scratches removal with After Effects and Neat Video ✔️
