Tilbrook is from England, of course, but he's no stranger to Thanksgiving. \"Come on!\" he chuckled during his 2015 visit to our studio. \"It's not my first time around the block.\" Tilbrook has some American friends who live near him in London, and when he's at home, Tilbrook celebrates Thanksgiving with them. For Thanksgiving 2015, Tilbrook and longtime bandmate Chris Difford were in the Twin Cities for back-to-back sold-out acoustic shows at the Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis. Prior to the gig, Tilbrook visited The Current to play some songs. Watch two performances from that session.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n0:00 \"Happy Days\"\n2:53 \"Black Coffee in Bed\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nGlenn Tilbrook \u2013 guitar, piano, vocals\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark; Tom Coughlin\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2014 interview with Mary Lucia: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2014/10/14/interview-glenn-tilbrook\n2015 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2015/11/24/glenn-tilbrook-of-squeeze-performs-at-the-current\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/\n\n#glenntilbrook #squeeze #squeezeband", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QY9T97wmHSQ", "date_published": "2020-11-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Listen to Looch - a new Chuck Berry documentary to watch", "description": "Mary Lucia talks about a new documentary, \"Chuck Berry: The Original King of Rock 'n' Roll.\" Directed by Jon Brewer, the documentary is available on multiple streaming platforms and on DVD, and it releases on Blu-ray on November 27, 2020. \n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWeS7QmwPh0", "date_published": "2020-11-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Pete Yorn - three songs at The Current (2019)", "description": "A year ago this week, Pete Yorn visited our studio to play a three-song acoustic set, accompanied by his friend and musical collaborator, Jackson Phillips.
