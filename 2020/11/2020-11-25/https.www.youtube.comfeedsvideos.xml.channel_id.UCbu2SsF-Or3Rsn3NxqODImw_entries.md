Building relationships with the citizens of Night City plays a huge role in Cyberpunk 2077's gameplay. Phil Hornshaw breaks down how it works, what sex is like in the game, and how you interact with Keaunu Reeves' Johnny Silverhand. 

He talks about building a relationship with a braindance editor called Judy, and how she and other characters will text V just to check in, or to offer side quests (we're not sure if they'll ask you to go bowling though). Johnny Silverhand is almost always present in the game, so Phil discusses how your character, V, approaches that relationship. Given the game's mature themes, Phil also lets us know what we can expect from the romance scenes. 

Cyberpunk 2077 launches on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and Google Stadia on December 10.
