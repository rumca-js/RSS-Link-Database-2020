Five years ago, Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze visited our studio just before Thanksgiving. Tilbrook is from England, of course, but he's no stranger to Thanksgiving. "Come on!" he chuckled during his 2015 visit to our studio. "It's not my first time around the block." Tilbrook has some American friends who live near him in London, and when he's at home, Tilbrook celebrates Thanksgiving with them. For Thanksgiving 2015, Tilbrook and longtime bandmate Chris Difford were in the Twin Cities for back-to-back sold-out acoustic shows at the Cedar Cultural Center in Minneapolis. Prior to the gig, Tilbrook visited The Current to play some songs. Watch two performances from that session.
