Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nSidney Madden | November 25, 2020\n\nIf 2020 has taught me one lesson, it\u2019s this: \u201cDon\u2019t wait on what\u2019s yours. Just go get it.\u201d At 21, Atlanta\u2019s record-setting fresh face Mulatto has spent her entire year embodying that lesson. \n \nWith her debut album, Queen Of Da Souf, and a relentless run of features, Big Latto has stamped her flag in hip-hop\u2019s most influential city at a crucial moment. At a time when women in hip-hop are running laps around the guys without so much as shifting their lace fronts, Latto is finding her footing in the new rap canon with Gold-charting singles, standout freestyles, and cosigns from the likes of Nicki Minaj, Gucci Mane and Trina. \n\nAs the inaugural winner of the Lifetime reality show The Rap Game and someone who's made music since the age of 10, the personality that Latto brings to her bars is goofy, assertive and steadfast: She chose her stage moniker to purposely flip the derogatory term she was teased with as a child on its head and uses social media hate to fuel her music. \n\nWith her burgeoning success coinciding with a global pandemic, Latto\u2019s found herself more comfortable in the studio than ever this year. Her Tiny Desk debut is a dispatch from her Queen Of Da Souf throne in Doppler Studios, right next to her crown. \n \nLatto rocks an aqua wig and raps perched from her throne while her violinist Joy Black and keyboardist SK go berserk on \u201cYoungest N Richest.\u201d It\u2019s not until \u201cHe Say She Say\u201d when Latto rises up from her seat to put extra emphasis behind this reminder: \u201cSelf-made b****, hell you talkin 'bout? / Yea, I got it out the mud, no handout.\u201d\n\n\nSET LIST\n\"Youngest N Richest\"\n\"Blame Me\"\n\"He Say She Say\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nMulatto: vocals\nJoy Black: violin\nSK: keys\n\nCREDITS\nVideo: Diesel Filmz\nAudio: Broderick Hughey\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Sidney Madden\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZZv2BDtP50", "date_published": "2020-11-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
