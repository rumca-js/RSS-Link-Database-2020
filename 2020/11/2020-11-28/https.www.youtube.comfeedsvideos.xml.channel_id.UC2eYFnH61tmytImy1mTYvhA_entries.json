(Or Bneither)", "description": "I constantly find myself at odds with people who choose and recommend software based on memes. Pulseaudio is totally \"\"\"bloated\"\"\", but using ALSA alone isn't a viable alternative for 99.9999% of people who want a functioning audio system. Pulse is a \"\"\"bloated\"\"\" front-end for ALSA, but before you whine about it, try to configure ALSA yourself for something beyond watching anime and YouTube. Yeah, yeah I know there are things like jack and such too. I've never really used it and documentation is just as scarce as for ALSA. Anyway, this is a video on why I use Pulseaudio and I'm not convinced that there are people who don't who do it for non-meme reasons.\n\nMy website: https://lukesmith.xyz\nPlease donate: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate\n\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://brave.com/luk005 Get the Brave browser.\nhttps://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke View my videos on LBRY.
