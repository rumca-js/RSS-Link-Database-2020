coronaviruses\n\nand animals exposure\n\nthe dose at which 50% of humans become infected is 10 to 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU)\n\nUK, human exposure trials in January 2021 to identify the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2\n\nGolden Syrian hamsters\n\nExposure to 56,000 PFU via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms\n\nImmunosuppressed, severe clinical symptoms (including death) after exposure to 100-10,000 PFU\n\nWe need to know\n\nHuman infectious dose;\n\nby aerosol\n\nsurface contact (fomite)\n\nfecal-oral routes\n\nother potential routes of exposure \n\nMost appropriate animal model(s) to estimate the human infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 \n\nDoes exposure dose determine disease severity? \n\nTransmission\n\nExhaled breath may emit 105-107 genome copies per person per hour \n\n100, 000 to 10,000,000\n\nDroplets\n\nAerosols\n\nFomites\n\nClose = a combined total of 15 minutes within 6 feet of an infected person in a 24-hour period \n\nInfectious for 1-3 days prior to symptom onset, 40%\n\nAsymptomatics, 12%\n\nFive days after symptom onset\n\nAsymptomatic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection\n\nAsymptomatic children may have substantially lower levels of virus in their upper respiratory tracts than symptomatic children \n\nIn the US, symptomatic index cases resulted in transmission to approximately 53% of household members \n\nSARS-CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation \n\nMost transmission indoors, offices, restaurants, bars, gyms\n\nClusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings \n\nUndetected cases play a major role in transmission\n\nMost cases are not reported\n\nIndividuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID-19 are unlikely to be infectious\n\nWe need to know\n\nRelative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets)\n \nHow common is transmission from bodily fluids like semen, urine, and feces?\n\nHow infectious are young children compared to adults?\n\nWhat is the emission rate of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles while breathing, talking, coughing, singing, or exercising\n\ntaking into account variation in viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C2KH3Xt3W0", "date_published": "2020-11-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user":
