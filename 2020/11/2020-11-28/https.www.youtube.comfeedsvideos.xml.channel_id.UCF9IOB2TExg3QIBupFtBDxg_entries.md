Current state of knowledge, 29th November

Infection

Human infectious dose, SARS-CoV-2, unknown by all exposure routes

However

Based on human exposure to other coronaviruses

and animals exposure

the dose at which 50% of humans become infected is 10 to 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU)

UK, human exposure trials in January 2021 to identify the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2

Golden Syrian hamsters

Exposure to 56,000 PFU via the intranasal route developed clinical symptoms

Immunosuppressed, severe clinical symptoms (including death) after exposure to 100-10,000 PFU

We need to know

Human infectious dose;

by aerosol

surface contact (fomite)

fecal-oral routes

other potential routes of exposure 

Most appropriate animal model(s) to estimate the human infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 

Does exposure dose determine disease severity? 

Transmission

Exhaled breath may emit 105-107 genome copies per person per hour 

100, 000 to 10,000,000

Droplets

Aerosols

Fomites

Close = a combined total of 15 minutes within 6 feet of an infected person in a 24-hour period 

Infectious for 1-3 days prior to symptom onset, 40%

Asymptomatics, 12%

Five days after symptom onset

Asymptomatic individuals can transmit disease as soon as 2 days after infection

Asymptomatic children may have substantially lower levels of virus in their upper respiratory tracts than symptomatic children 

In the US, symptomatic index cases resulted in transmission to approximately 53% of household members 

SARS-CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation 

Most transmission indoors, offices, restaurants, bars, gyms

Clusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings 

Undetected cases play a major role in transmission

Most cases are not reported

Individuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID-19 are unlikely to be infectious

We need to know

Relative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets)
 
How common is transmission from bodily fluids like semen, urine, and feces?

How infectious are young children compared to adults?

What is the emission rate of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles while breathing, talking, coughing, singing, or exercising

taking into account variation in viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract?

Professor Paul Garner, (Epidemiology, at LSTM)

95th day after the onset of symptoms

I am unable to be out of bed for more than three hours at a stretch 

my arms and legs are permanently fizzing as if injected with Szechuan peppercorns 

I have ringing in the ears 

Intermittent brain fog 

Palpitation, 

Dramatic mood swings

Long COVID

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/long-term-effects.html

Many organs besides the lungs are affected

Most recover and return to normal health

Some have symptoms that last for weeks or months

After recovery from acute illness

Long term features occur after mild and severe acute phases

Multi-year studies are underway

CDC is actively working to learn more

How common?

Who is most likely to suffer?

Do symptoms eventually resolve?

Most commonly reported long-term symptoms

Fatigue

Shortness of breath

Cough

Joint pain

Chest pain

Other reported long-term symptoms

Difficulty with thinking and concentration (brain fog)

Depression

Muscle pain

Headache

Intermittent fever

Fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations)

More serious long-term complications, less common

Cardiovascular: inflammation of the heart muscle

Respiratory: lung function abnormalities

Renal: acute kidney injury

Dermatologic: rash, hair loss

Neurological: smell and taste problems, sleep issues, difficulty with concentration, memory problems

Psychiatric: depression, anxiety, changes in mood

(CDC stresses prevention)


NHS response (15th November)

https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/11/nhs-launches-40-long-covid-clinics-to-tackle-persistent-symptoms/

Launching a network of more than 40 pioneer ‘long COVID’ clinics

To help thousands of patients suffering debilitating effects of the virus months after being infected

Affecting more than 60,000 people in the UK

Can cause continuing fatigue, brain fog, breathlessness and pain

Criteria

Hospitalised, officially diagnosed or reasonably believe they had COVID-19

Usually via GP referral

NHS Chief Executive, Sir Simon Stevens

Long COVID is already having a very serious impact on many people’s lives and could well go on to affect hundreds of thousands

clinics will help address the very real problems being faced by patients today

Taskforce will help the NHS develop a greater understanding of the lasting effects of coronavirus

Long COVID can be categorised into four different syndromes

Post intensive care syndrome

Post viral fatigue syndrome

Permanent organ damage

Long term COVID syndrome


Reflections of a COVID-19 Long Hauler (11th November)

https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2773056

Doctor Jeffrey Singleman

Monday morning

Headache

Then fever

Next day, complete loss of taste

Mild Illness Can Have Dramatic Effects

No preexisting conditions

Never hospitalized

Had minimal respiratory symptoms

Limited office work throughout the acute illness

Three months later

Fatigue that has kept me couch-bound

Low-grade fevers continued

Self isolated for 40 days

The Lack of Objective Data Does Not Preclude Illness

My test results were normal

Normal nasopharyngeal swabs, imaging, laboratory results, oxygen saturation

But I did not feel fine, and still do not

I have had a rotating constellation of symptoms, different each day and worse each evening
Fever, headache, dizziness, palpitations, tachycardia, and others
Listen to the patient first, even in the absence of conclusive testing
I would eat something without taste 
Would feel my heart pounding uncontrollably for hours
Would get so dizzy that I could not even write a simple letter
