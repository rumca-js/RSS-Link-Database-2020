<p>After months that passed in a haze of isolation, Melburnians are reconnecting with the places and people they love</p><p>In the depths of Melbourne’s lockdown, time began to pass differently. The days and weeks dragged as the year slipped by, as all the usual markers – celebrations, family dinners, holidays – were stripped away.

<p> Johann Christoph Volkamer was a 17th -century Nuremberg silk merchant with passion for gardening that defined his life. He was obsessed with citrus fruit at a time when the genus was largely unknown in northern Europe. In 1708, he commissioned 256 plates of 170 varieties of the fruit – images collected in a new book by Prof Iris Lauterbach called <a href="">JC Volkamer. Citrus Fruits (Taschen, out 2 December)</a>. </p><p>Lauterbach, an art historian, understands his devotion. “Citrus trees are beautiful. The trees that bloom and fruit at the same time in orangeries evoke the idea of a timeless paradise of blissful happiness.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2020/nov/28/an-early-modern-ode-to-citrus-fruit-in-pictures">Continue reading...</a>

## Camilla Pang: 'You have to acknowledge the hilarity of what it is to be human'

<p>Prize-winning author Camilla Pang talks about her autism and ADHD diagnoses and her desire to challenge myths about neurodiversity</p><p>This month Camilla Pang won the Royal Society book prize for her debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/03/neurodivergent-author-camilla-pangs-explaining-humans-wins-royal-society-prize">Explaining Humans: What Science Can Teach Us about Life, Love and Relationships</a>. </em>She has a PhD in bioinformatics from UCL and works as a postdoctoral researcher. Dr Pang was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at the age of eight and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder at 26.</p><p><strong>Why did you decide to write this book?<br /></strong>I inadvertently wrote the book in my PhD thesis on bioinformatics, and my supervisor, bless her, said this is great, but it doesn’t belong here. One of the things people on the autistic spectrum do is organise our world in a way that makes sense to us using objects and sequences. For me, those sequences involved looking at the fundamentals of matter, and what that meant in terms of science. Even if I was just kicking a pile of leaves, I would do it repetitively in order to find the laws about how things react, and how they can be predicted. So from kicking leaves to Post-it notes to eventually reading about science, I constructed a map to navigate the world. Over time, it became bigger and notebooks piled up, so I ended up with a piece of work that I thought might be useful to someone else. And that’s the ultimate goal, isn’t it? You want to connect with people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/28/camilla-pang-you-have-to-acknowledge-the-hilarity-of-what-it-is-to-be-human">Continue reading...</a>

## How I fell in love with arancine in Sicily – plus the recipe to make them

<p>When the ferry docks in Palermo, the food writer heads straight to a waterside bar to devour these delicious deep-fried rice balls</p><p>Every evening at 8pm and 8.15pm, two ferries leave the port of Naples and cut their way across the inky Tyrrhenian Sea to Palermo. The one that leaves second arrives first, at 6.45am, while the other docks at 7.30am, or thereabouts. We are always late booking travel for our annual summer trip to my partner’s hometown in Sicily, so take whatever we can get. And 45 minutes is unimportant when summer is before us. Also it means we can sleep longer in the cabin, we tell ourselves. Of course, we don’t sleep longer. We are up on the deck watching the day arrive and the port, with its backdrop of heaving mountains, get bigger. Our appetites grow, too, as we near the island, and for one thing – <em>arancini</em>.</p><p>And not just any arancini, but those from a bar a couple of kilometres from the port on Via Simone Gulì. Our car, an old boxy Fiat Panda, knows the route well, and scuttles down the ferry ramp, past the prison and port workshops to the yacht harbour, Marina Villa Igiea. On a main road, near the busy port and surrounded by apartments, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aranciniarancini/">Bar Turistico</a> is, at 8am, as bright and angular as a 1980s hairdo, full of locals, port workers and tourists, the air thick with the scent of coffee.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/nov/28/why-a-plate-of-arancini-means-our-summer-in-sicily-has-begun-plus-the-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>At 32, I was given a choice: go to hospital every day – or risk a long wait to become an inpatient. Could I face down the demons that had stalked me since I was a child?</p><p>I throw the bread. It misses the nurse and lands in the metal sink with a pathetic thud. I run out of the kitchen, through a door labelled “quiet room” and kick a beanbag. I kick it again and again, until all I can see is the red fabric and white wall blurring into pink. I want to smash something, I want to break things until I collapse with exhaustion and never wake up.</p><p>But psychiatric hospitals are built to stop people like me doing that. No door handles or light fittings; no sharp objects or windows that open more than an inch. It is March 2017. I used to have a job, a life. Now, I am a 32-year-old woman who isn’t allowed to be alone with a pair of scissors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/28/i-was-at-war-with-my-body-my-year-as-a-day-patient-on-an-eating-disorders-ward">Continue reading...</a>

## Photos of locked-down cities sold us a fantasy that we were 'in it together' | Sophie Haigney

<p>Back in the spring we were astonished by pictures of deserted tourist sites. But they didn’t tell the full story</p><p>I have been looking lately at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/an-unreal-city-coronavirus-lockdown-in-london">photos taken in mid-March</a> of the world emptying out. Many of these images were taken from above or at wide angles, revealing vast swaths of space where people used to be. Major tourist sites were suddenly vacant: <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/28/scenes-of-cities-shut-down-by-the-coronavirus-pandemic.html">Times Square</a> stopped bustling; only pigeons frequented the plazas <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/2020/03/eerie-capturing-emptiness-paris-coronavirus-lockdown/">near the Eiffel Tower</a>; the view from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/11/italy-coronavirus-lockdown-leaves-streets-deserted-in-pictures">Spanish Steps</a> revealed an unpeopled slice of Rome. Railway platforms, airport terminals, sports stadiums, concert halls and shopping centre car parks looked suddenly and strangely blank. Even beaches, seen from above, looked scrubbed of human life.</p><p>I find these photos perversely beautiful. They are evidence of something truly terrible: the pandemic, and also of the sudden suspension of social and communal life in public that began in March. And yet perhaps I harbour the germ of a twisted visual fantasy that involves being the last person on Earth, achieving a kind of apocalyptic solitude, and experiencing the beauty of the manmade and natural world in lonely ecstasy. This, after all, is why normally so many of us go to museums at off-peak times and travel in off-season: to get away from others and to be almost alone in beautiful spaces. On a basic level, I think the visual appeal of these eerie photos comes from a place of latent alienation, a dark desire to hoard the world’s beauty for ourselves.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/28/photos-locked-down-cities-pictures-deserted-tourist-sites">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Three noodle dishes for maximum winter comfort: sambal crab, homemade biang biang and coconut and pineapple vermicelli</p><p>Everyone (still) sitting comfortably? Still eating well? November, hey? Eating-wise, the month has, for me, increasingly become about turning to food that comforts. Comfort food means different things to different people, of course. For some, it suggests something that can be happily slurped or that has to be eaten from a bowl. For others, it’s a meal that can be thrown together quickly or, conversely, that requires a bit of time to perfect. For others still, comfort food is always something sweet. My general answer to this search for comfort is noodles, and my specific answer is this week’s recipes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/28/yotam-ottolenghi-noodle-recipes-sambal-crab-biang-biang-pineapple-vermicelli">Continue reading...</a>

Designed by Foster and Partners for J Safra Group, it would stand five metres from the Gherkin, also Foster-designed and Safra-owned.</p><p>Unlike other City towers, the Tulip’s object is not to maximise lettable square metres but to create restaurants, bars, viewing galleries and “classrooms in the sky”, all placed in a glass bud at the top of a long concrete stalk.

The baby is now sleep-trained, but I have managed to un-sleep-train myself. “Is there greater hell than this?” I’d wonder, soothing a bawling baby at 4.13am, but if there’s one thing 2020 has taught us, it’s that the answer to that question is always yes. What’s worse than being kept awake by your baby? Being kept awake by your own fritzed-out brain, while that treacherous little baby sleeps peacefully. I’ve considered demanding she now soothe me – a bit of quid pro quo here, baby – but I’m not sure she can sling me over her shoulder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/28/im-in-bed-with-stranger-finally-getting-sleep-hadley-freeman">Continue reading...</a>

And yet as Abramovich watches on from afar – presumably from his Moscow palace, surrounded by objets d’art and luxury snacks – he may reflect that this is a curiously appropriate fixture to mark the occasion. It is, after all, a meeting between the two men who have arguably defined his 17 years in English football more than any other.

<p>The former Speaker and MP for selective Buckingham was an ardent defender - until his own children went to school and he drilled down into the stats </p><p>Until last year, I was the MP for Buckingham, in one of the few counties where education is fully selective. In the town there are two state secondary schools, a grammar and a secondary modern, right next door to each other. The Royal Latin, founded in 1423, the one grammar school in the constituency, seemed to me to be the embodiment of excellence and confidence. Next to it was the Buckingham school, the local secondary modern, less traditional, admirably serving its pupils who did not pass the 11-plus.</p><p>I was warmly welcomed in both schools. But the local political and civic establishment in Buckinghamshire was much more interested in the grammar school. There was a “them and us” attitude. Grammar pupils were encouraged to feel superior and many secondary modern students probably resented them. In later years, there was more collaboration between the schools’ headteachers – sharing of facilities and joint art and drama events, in an effort to bridge the gap in small ways. When I was elected in 1997, it seemed like an apartheid system.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/nov/28/john-bercow-ive-changed-my-mind-grammar-schools-must-go">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ears aside, Josh O’Connor wasn’t the obvious choice to play the heir to the throne in The Crown. The Labour-supporting republican talks lucky breaks, lockdown and life after Charles</p><p>When we meet at 4.15pm on a Saturday in late October, Josh O’Connor is in the middle of one of those hot streaks that British actors occasionally enjoy when everything comes good at once.

So who knows what will happen now.” He looks up, neutrally – then the freckled face opens into a wide, goofy smile, the expression of somebody essentially good-humoured and easy-going taking life as it comes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/28/josh-oconnor-the-crown-beyond-prince-charles-being-very-rich-and-posh-wheres-the-juice-to-him-wheres-the-stuff">Continue reading...</a>

Even given the ongoing second lockdown, Collier’s celebrations were on the modest side. “I had a nice tall glass of water,” he says. “It’s such a 2020 project so I guess it merits a 2020-style introverted celebration.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/28/jacob-collier-grammy-nomination-best-album">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Home owners can get help from government schemes but do they really cut costs?</p><p>When Graham Davidson and his wife, Pauline, retired to a bungalow in Norfolk three years ago they ripped out the old boiler and replaced it with an air source heat pump at a cost of £10,000. But this pricey replacement has turned into a moneyspinner for the Davidsons – and millions of British households are likely to follow suit in what is expected to be a revolution in home heating.</p><p>Davidson, 68, who used to work in the car electronics business, says it was financial gain rather than saving the planet that was at the forefront of his decision. But dumping the gas boiler has probably cut his household carbon emissions by more than half.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/28/heat-pumps-have-a-cosy-home-without-warming-the-planet">Continue reading...</a>
