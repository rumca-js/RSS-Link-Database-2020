iPhone 12 and iPhone 12 Pro are a little different this year. They have the same screen size, same screen resolution, similar form factor, the same A14 Bionic; frankly, the similarities are so great it's easier to count the differences. And most of them are in software. Night mode Portrait mode photos are cool and the extra RAM could come in handy along with the new LiDAR sensor, but does it *really*? And does 5G iPhone make a difference? Does mmWave even matter? We talk about this and more to help you decide which of the two mainline iPhones are best before the launch of iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro.
