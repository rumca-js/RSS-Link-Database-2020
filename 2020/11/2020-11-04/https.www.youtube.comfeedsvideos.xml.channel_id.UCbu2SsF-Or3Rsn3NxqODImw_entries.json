Backwards compatibility is also a standout feature for the Xbox Series X, including its optimization of previous-gen games, and how it can boost their performance. Most notably, games like Gears 5 can have their frame rates boosted to 120 FPS. Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice is another game that exemplifies the power of the console\u2019s optimization for past-gen games, increasing its original 30 FPS to a consistent 60 FPS.\n\nWhile the console lacks a strong lineup of launch titles, due in part to the delay of Halo: Infinite, the Xbox Series X is still a confident display of next-generation technology. But you\u2019ll learn a whole lot more about that in the video review.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkcU75ndgdQ", "date_published": "2020-11-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Yakuza: Like A Dragon Review", "description": "Yakuza: Like a Dragon's cast of misfits makes the wild RPG combat, absurd humor, and dramatic storytelling soar.
