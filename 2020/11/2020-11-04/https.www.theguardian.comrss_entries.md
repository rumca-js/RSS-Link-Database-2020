<p>It is right that MPs represent a spectrum of opinion, but there is precedent for Conservative governments being hijacked by a factional minority</p><p>It is unusual for prime ministers to apologise for their policies the way Boris Johnson seeds his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/oct/31/uk-coronavirus-boris-johnson-to-give-press-conference-on-new-lockdown-live-news" title="">lockdown announcements</a> with regret and reluctance. Some of that tone is understandable, but it too often shades into evasion of responsibility. He sounds unwilling to own the choices he has made.</p><p>The squeamishness is not surprising. Many of Mr Johnson’s instincts are libertarian. If he were not sponsoring the new English lockdown from Downing Street, he might have been among the 32 Tory backbench MPs who voted against it on Wednesday.

<p>What do you do if your dog is chewing your computer lead or your moggy keeps deleting your emails? Animal behavioural experts give their advice for harmonious homeworking</p><p>I am sitting at my computer, in my office at the end of the garden, typing. On the other side of the door, the cat is staring at me through the glass. It is a hard stare. I know the cat wants to come in so that he can climb on to my desk and walk back and forth across my keyboard, deleting files and pressing Send prematurely. He knows that, if he does this with sufficient persistence, I will eventually feed him, even though I have already fed him. Anything, just to get a little work done. So the door remains shut, and I’m getting a stiff neck from trying not to make eye contact.</p><p>Pets were meant to be the great beneficiaries of the pandemic: with so many people furloughed or working from home, the dogs and cats of Britain would finally receive the attention they craved. And the food. Soon, however, people discovered that home-working and pet-owning were not entirely compatible. Cats don’t care if you are in the middle of a Zoom meeting. Dogs don’t understand deadlines. Some parrots make so much noise during the day that one charity recently reported a 70% annual increase in those needing rehoming. In the spring, the whole awkward arrangement seemed charmingly temporary but, as England locks down for a second time, many pet owners still have not found the right balance between work and the animals they care for – between cat and keyboard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/04/sit-stay-get-off-my-zoom-call-how-to-work-from-home-when-your-pet-wont-let-you">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Care-taking is difficult, consuming labour, writes advice columnist <strong>Eleanor Gordon-Smith</strong>, and you deserve help in caring for yourself as well as him</p><p><strong>I love my husband dearly. I took care of my parents for 15 years. I was their caregiver until they died. Afterwards my husband fell ill and for a year doctors have been trying to find out what is wrong. He is very depressed, sits in his chair all day and gets no exercise. I’ve tried to be patient to let him heal while the doctors continue to run tests. I am almost 70 years old. He is 59. Recently I find myself resentful of anything I have to do for him, because he doesn’t want to do anything to get better. Everything in our lives is left up to me, whether it’s paying the bills or physically taking care of the inside and outside our home. He won’t even take out the trash.</strong></p><p><strong>He is very, very depressed and now I am getting depressed and resentful that for the past year everything has fallen on my shoulders. I try so hard to be kind and not push him, because I know how tired he feels all the time.

He talks about the reality show Don’t Rock the Boat and his earlier highs and lows, from £200,000 cheques to tabloid exposés</p><p>Craig Charles calls it his midlife crisis. There he was sitting at home, mid-pandemic, in a fuddle. Because of social distancing rules he could no longer DJ his live music gigs. Sure, there were still the other jobs – hosting his fabulous funk and soul Saturday show on BBC Radio 6 Music, acting on TV (notably Red Dwarf and, in the past, Coronation Street), co-presenting The Gadget Show, writing poetry – but it was the live gigs that gave him most pleasure and brought in the big money.</p><p>Like so many of us, he began to feel life was on hold, and wondered what his purpose was. He started indulging his vices. “My wife, Jackie, and my kids were having a go at me because I’d put so much weight on.

<p>Comfort exists on another planet for the heroine of this dark, explosive follow-up to Convenience Store Woman </p><p>Sayaka Murata’s new novel takes the quietly spoken themes of her cult hit <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/07/convenience-store-woman-sayaka-murata-review">Convenience Store Woman</a></em> and sends them into orbit. The two books might be seen as siblings, though <em>Earthlings</em> would definitely be the evil twin. Both feature young women who reject society’s expectations and seek comfort in replacement forms of community. For Keiko in <em>Convenience Store Woman</em>, it was the reassuringly uniform, striplit security of the shop where she had worked all her adult life. For 10-year-old Natsuki in <em>Earthlings</em>, it’s the imaginary planet Popinpobopia, which she believes to be her destiny, at least according to her cuddly toy Piyyut.</p><p>So far, so <em>kawaii</em>, but the cute whimsy unrolled before the reader in the opening pages turns out to be covering a trapdoor. Natsuki conjures a makeshift family out of Piyyut and her cousin Yuu because her existing family doesn’t work. Her mother calls her “hopeless … she’s like a weight around my neck”. Natsuki and Yuu carry out a mock marriage, pledging to one another to “survive, whatever it takes”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/04/earthlings-by-sayaka-murata-review-a-fizzing-tale-of-alienation">Continue reading...</a>

## Rethinking fairytales as feminist fables is rescuing them, not ruining them | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett

<p>A new collection of rejigged tales gets much closer to the spirit of these stories than the ‘traditional’ versions we’re force-fed <br /></p><p>There’s a book called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politically_Correct_Bedtime_Stories">Politically Correct Bedtime Stories</a>, written by James Finn Garner, which used to be on my parents’ shelves, and is now on mine. Published in 1994, it was a massive bestseller in its time, satirising changing social attitudes and acting as an amusing corrective for the holier-than-thou: Little Red Riding Hood, for example, finds the wolf’s suggestion that it isn’t safe for a little girl to walk through the woods alone “sexist” and “offensive in the extreme… ” but, she says, “I will ignore it because of your traditional status as an outcast from society, the stress of which has caused you to develop your own, entirely valid, worldview”. It also stands as a reminder that the so-called culture wars, all that rightwing fury at the “tyranny of woke”, are simply the political-correctness-gone-mad wars of yesteryear rebranded for a new, digital age.</p><p>Right-on children’s books have had a resurgence, as demonstrated by the success of series such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-review-inspiring-stuff-elena-favilli-francesca-callo">Good Night </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/apr/04/good-night-stories-for-rebel-girls-review-inspiring-stuff-elena-favilli-francesca-callo">Stories for Rebel Girls</a>. This autumn, children have been gifted four rejigged fairytales in the form of Vintage Children’s Classics’ new <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/series/faitalre/a-fairy-tale-revolution.html">Fairy Tale Revolution series</a>, which sees Bluebeard, Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel and The Ugly Duckling revisited by Malorie Blackman, Rebecca Solnit, Jeanette Winterson and Kamila Shamsie respectively. They are all just lovely: sweet and funny and, if you’re an adult reading them, unexpectedly moving too. I sincerely hope that the culture warriors don’t get a hold of them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/04/rethinking-fairytales-feminist-fables-tales-stories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s been a night of increasingly tense election results. Pollsters had projected a big win for the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, but with the major swing states too close to call at the time of recording, his route to the White House appeared to be narrowing</p><p>It’s an election that has been described as a battle for America’s soul. Millions of Americans queued up to vote as turnout swelled to record levels on the back of huge mail-in votes. Guardian reporters spent the night in swing states and with the two campaigns as the night unfolded. <strong>Daniel Strauss </strong>watched as Joe Biden’s early cautious optimism seemed to be undercut by initial results before returning again later on. <strong>David Smith</strong> was picking up optimism too from the Trump campaign, which was jubilant with early results. </p><p><strong>Ed Pilkington </strong>told <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that he was having a flashback to 2016 as results from Florida indicated it was heading into Trump’s column, this was later confirmed. At a Republican watch party in Palm Beach, <strong>Oliver Laughland </strong>described increasing excitement of Trump supporters. Meanwhile in Arizona, <strong>Vivian Ho </strong>watched on as Democrats became increasingly convinced they had flipped the former red state. It’s a presidential race that could end up hingeing on the result in the swing state of Pennsylvania where <strong>Nina Lakhani </strong>explains that the counting is nowhere near complete. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/04/us-election-2020-how-the-night-unfolded-podcast">Continue reading...</a>

Some hum along; mostly they sing, or laugh and dance. At the end, when quiet returns, their mood is assessed – as it was when the session started.</p><p>Once or twice a month, Bola Otegbayo brings a team of singers and instrumentalists into this psychiatric unit at University College hospital (UCH) in Ibadan, Nigeria. Otegbayo realised a few years ago that some of her patients were lonely even though their loved ones visited and caregivers provided succour. So she began to share music.

<p>Lockdown binges, craft gin and ‘kitchen suppers’ ... a terrific history, in bite-sized chunks, of how food and drink relates to social status</p><p>During peak lockdown you couldn’t move for stories about furloughed professionals filling their empty days with heroic bouts of home baking. Deliveroo couriers, by contrast, were pictured stuffing down Wispas while chasing their next scrap of paid work. Obesity, already understood as a consequence of economic and cultural deprivation, gained a new terror with the discovery that overweight people were 50% more likely to die of the virus. And now there’s a new twist to the story of food privilege with the revelation that 70% of our immune system lives in our guts. For those who can afford it, pricey probiotics have become a staple ingredient in the Covid-era kitchen.</p><p>Nothing about this story of food inequality would come as a surprise to Pen Vogler, who sets out to show how the relationship between class and food was baked into Britain from the beginning. Her title, <em>Scoff,</em> plays on two meanings, the first being to chow down and fill your boots with whatever good things come your way, while the second means to mock or negate another person’s way of life – their taste, in other words. In Vogler’s rich survey these two meanings weave around each other as she offers a series of bite-sized chunks on the social status of everything from gingerbread to veal, fish and chips to quince.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/04/scoff-by-pen-volger-review-food-and-class-in-britain">Continue reading...</a>

His words are a fitting description of our own predicament. As England enters a second lockdown, people are tired and frustrated by restrictions that seem to bear no fruit. They are becoming fractious and divided; many who supported the first lockdown have fallen silent, while those who object to lockdown measures are becoming more flagrant in their opposition. The optimism of early summer feels like a distant memory.</p><p>A recent report on the BBC website captured this growing sense of dissent and disarray.

Ha! Bet you’re not as bad as me.</p><p>For years this rarely bothered me but, like so many of us in the first lockdown, I gloried in previously familiar green city spaces, and longed to record the joy they brought.

## 'We were lucky people didn't throw tomatoes': Klaus Voormann on his Beatles and Plastic Ono days

<p>He played with the Fab Four in Hamburg, inspired their moptops, drew the famed Revolver cover, and gigged with Yoko Ono. As his illustrations are published, the great musician relives his fabulous escapades</p><p>In September 1969, the bass player and artist Klaus Voormann, who had recently left <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2015/jul/05/greenpeace-mandfred-mann-environment-third-runway">Manfred Mann</a>, received a phone call from John Lennon. There was nothing unusual in that. Voormann had known the Beatles for nine years and was part of the band’s tight inner circle. It was Voormann’s own band, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/nov/15/guardianobituaries3">Paddy, Klaus and Gibson</a>, that Lennon and George Harrison had attempted to go and see live on the night they were famously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/28/road-trips-yoga-and-lsd-with-the-dentist-what-the-beatles-did-next">dosed with LSD at a dinner party</a>. Ringo Starr was already at the gig and was noisily confronted by his lysergically altered bandmates claiming that the venue’s lift was on fire. A year later, he had designed the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jul/23/beatles-revolver-cover-klaus-voormann">Grammy award-winning cover of Revolver</a>.</p><p>The issue was more what Lennon wanted him to do. Lennon had whimsically agreed to perform live at a rock’n’roll revival festival in Toronto at two days’ notice and was trying to cobble together backing musicians to play as the Plastic Ono Band. Eric Clapton had agreed to play guitar, but Voormann took more convincing, on the not-unreasonable grounds that headlining a festival with a new band who hadn’t rehearsed didn’t seem like one of Lennon’s more inspired ideas. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/04/klaus-voormann-beatles-plastic-ono-fab-four-moptops-revolver">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘She was gangsta with her clothes’: How Princess Diana became 2020’s biggest style icon

<p>Her image is everywhere – in the return of The Crown, a Hollywood film, musical and emulated on the cover of Vogue. For the younger generation, there is no greater fashion inspiration right now</p><p>Until this spring, the defining experience of shared grief and loss in living British memory could be summed up in one word: Diana. The sea of flowers outside Kensington palace. The outpouring of emotion that recalibrated a country’s self-image. The cultural and political shock waves that threatened the monarchy. And the sickening jolt that comes with finding that the world can turn itself upside down without a moment’s notice.</p><p>Now, in this strange season of death, Diana is about to make a return to our national life. The fourth season of The Crown has already put Princess Diana back in Vogue. But there is also a documentary to mark the 25th anniversary of her death, and a Hollywood film, Spencer, in the works, in which Kristen Stewart plays the princess. Netflix has also announced the Diana musical is to be filmed and broadcast next year. While in real life, the row over her interview with Martin Bashir has reignited, with Diana’s brother, Earl Spencer, calling for a formal inquiry into how it was secured.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/nov/04/she-was-gangsta-with-her-clothes-how-princess-diana-became-2020s-biggest-style-icon">Continue reading...</a>
