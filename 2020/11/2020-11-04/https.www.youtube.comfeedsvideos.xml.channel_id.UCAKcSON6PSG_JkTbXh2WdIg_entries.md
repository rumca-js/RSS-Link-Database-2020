Five years ago — Nov. 4, 2015 — Albert Hammond Jr. and his band visited our studio to play songs from Hammond's 2008 album, "¿Cómo Te Llama?" and his 2015 release, "Momentary Masters." It was the second visit to The Current studio for Albert Hammond Jr.; he had last visited us in 2007, when he played songs from his 2006 debut solo release, "Yours To Keep." Also notable is AHJ's other band, the Strokes, just played "Saturday Night Live" this past weekend. Watch three performances by Albert Hammond Jr: two from that 2015 session, and one from 2007, plucked from our archives.
