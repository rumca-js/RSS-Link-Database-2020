Here's your guide with 10 early game tips to help you get the most from Ubisoft's latest.\n\nAssassin's Creed Valhalla is a meaty RPG thatoffers sprawling quests, a huge map, and a, frankly, intimidating-looking skill tree. It's possible to be overwhelmed when you boot the game up, but don't worry, we've got you covered with some early-game tips to help you get the most out of your time as a Viking raider.\n\nIn the video above, we tell you which collectables to be on the lookout for, how to find the best abilities for Eivor, and, crucially, how to find a wolf to join you in battle and a cat for your longship. If you're stuck looking for a certain yellow longship, we have the answer to that too (but we put a spoiler warning on it, don't worry). We also point out some side activities that you won't want to miss, such as flyting aka Viking rap battles. Yes, you read that right.\u00a0\n\nFor more on Assassin's Creed Valhalla, make sure to check out our review, as well as our video comparing visuals and load times between the Xbox Series X and Xbox One X versions of the game.\n\n\n0:00 Intro\n0:15 Assassin's Creed Valhalla item upgrades\u00a0\n0:46 Flyting\n1:13 Assassin's Creed Valhalla's coolest secrets and hidden bosses\n2:05 Assassin's Creed Valhalla skill tree, abilities, and Books of Knowledge\n2:49 How to get a wolf companion in Assassin's Creed Valhalla\n3:21 Barracks and jomsvikings\n3:34 Hunting Legendary animals\n3:50 Order of Ancient medallions\u00a0\n4:03 Assassin's Creed Valhalla cat companion\n4:20 Where's the yellow boat in Soma's quest?

From there, we take a look at load times, specifically as we fast travel to England. On Series X, this takes 17 seconds, whereas the same task takes more than four times as long to complete on Xbox One.\n\nYou can watch the video for much more on what to expect between the two versions, and be sure to check out GameSpot for our full Assassin's Creed Valhalla review and much more next-gen coverage.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p65cBwWH-CU", "date_published": "2020-11-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Xbox Series X/S Livestream: AMA With The Reviewer", "description": "Jake and Michael celebrate the launch of the Xbox Series X and S by playing some games and answering your burning questions.
