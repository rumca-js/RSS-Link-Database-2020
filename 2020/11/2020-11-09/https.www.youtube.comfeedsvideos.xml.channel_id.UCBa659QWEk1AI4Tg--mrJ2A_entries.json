They're helpful for folks without headphones, or in loud environments, or who can't hear well, or who just like subtitles. More people will watch if subtitles are an option.\n\nBefore 2020, YouTube had a volunteer community-captions system. Alas, due to spam (and, I suspect, the difficulty of porting it to the new Studio), YouTube turned it off. So your options are:\n\nOPTION 1: DO IT YOURSELF\n\nIf your video is one or two people talking, you can add subtitles easily with YouTube's tools: https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2734796 - that's also possible for more complex videos, but it can be time-consuming.\n\nOPTION 2: PAY A SMALL AMOUNT\n\nIf you can afford an editor, you can afford subtitles! They only cost $1-2 per minute of audio.\n\nFor simple audio, try Rev: https://www.rev.com/blog/coupon/?ref=tomscott To be clear, that's an affiliate link: you get $10 of captions free (enough for up to an 8-minute video), and I get a kickback from them. However, my opinions of Rev are mixed. They have downsides, and they may not be the right option for you!\n\nAdvantages of Rev:\n\u2705 Extremely fast turnaround\n\u2705 Easy, simple, automated, self-service\n\u2705 Reasonable price\n\nDisadvantages of Rev:\n\ud83d\udeab Rev is a gig-economy company, with everything that entails. In 2019, transcribers raised issues including low pay. https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20979249/rev-recordings-transcriptions-low-pay-complaints-freelance-transcribers\n\ud83d\udeab Accuracy is usually acceptable for clear speech, but not the near-perfect results you'd expect from a more high-end subtitle company.\n\ud83d\udeab They're limited to their simple, narrow, house style. That isn't ideal for videos with long sentences or many speakers.\n\nFor more complicated audio or for multiple speakers, try Caption+: https://caption.plus -- a small company that produces extremely high-quality subtitles for a reasonable price.\n\nAdvantages of Caption+:\n\u2705 Exceptional subtitle accuracy.\n\u2705 Hand-tweaked broadcast-standard subtitles that are perfect for accessibility, and which the audience love.\n\u2705 Can use positioning and per-speaker colors, and match other style requests.\n\u2705 Still a reasonable price.\n\nDisadvantages of Caption+:\n\ud83d\udeab Not automated: you're dealing with a human by email, and paying invoices.\n\nOTHER COMPANIES: I also used 3PlayMedia once, but unfortunately can't recommend them based on that experience. YouTube also mention ceilo24 and Amara, neither of which I have experience with: https://cielo24.com/ https://amara.org/\n\n\ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\udcfa SHOWS \ud83d\udcfa\ud83d\udcfa\n\nHere's a list of all the shows mentioned, with links where available.
