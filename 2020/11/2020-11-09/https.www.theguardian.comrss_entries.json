This autumn, he was forthright on the subject of the government\u2019s controversial internal market bill, which was again debated on Monday in the House of Lords. The proposed legislation effectively reneges on a legally binding protocol signed with the EU, which would impose customs checks on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland. In doing so, it summons up the spectre of a hard border on the island of Ireland, undermining the Good Friday agreement. Mr Biden is adamant that the GFA must not \u201cbecome a casualty of Brexit\u201d. He is expected to convey that message, in forceful terms, when his first telephone conversation with Mr Johnson eventually takes place.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/09/the-guardian-view-on-johnsons-biden-problem-not-going-away\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/09/the-guardian-view-on-johnsons-biden-problem-not-going-away", "date_published": "2020-11-09 19:25:48+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK to make climate risk reports mandatory for large companies", "description": "<p>Rishi Sunak says disclosures will be mandatory within five years as part of net-zero plans</p><p>Large companies and financial institutions in the UK will have to come clean about their exposure to climate risks within five years under the terms of a tougher regime announced by the chancellor, Rishi Sunak.</p><p>In an attempt to demonstrate the government\u2019s commitment to tackling global heating, Sunak said the UK would go further than an international taskforce had recommended and make disclosure by large businesses mandatory.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/09/uk-to-make-climate-risk-reports-mandatory-for-large-companies\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/09/uk-to-make-climate-risk-reports-mandatory-for-large-companies", "date_published": "2020-11-09 19:18:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK 'house of horrors' couple found guilty of murdering woman", "description": "<p>Nathan Maynard-Ellis and David Leesley convicted of killing Julia Rawson in Tipton<br /></p><p>A horror film fan and his boyfriend have been found guilty of murdering a woman who was lured to their \u201cflat of horrors\u201d after a chance meeting during a night out.</p><p>A month-long trial was told serial killer obsessive Nathan Maynard-Ellis, aged 30, and his partner, 25-year-old David Leesley, cut Julia Rawson\u2019s body into 11 pieces and dumped her remains at two sites near a canal.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/09/uk-house-of-horrors-couple-found-guilty-of-murdering-woman\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/09/uk-house-of-horrors-couple-found-guilty-of-murdering-woman", "date_published": "2020-11-09 18:54:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Loser!
