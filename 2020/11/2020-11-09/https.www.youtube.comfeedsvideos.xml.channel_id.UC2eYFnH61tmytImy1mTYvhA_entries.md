I want to clear up some misconceptions about how passwords can be stored for secure purposes. Specifically, it is very possible to *not* store a password, yet still be able to test user credentials when they attempt to log on. Dumb systems store either plaintext or encrypted passwords, while more secure systems never store passwords, but only password *hashes* and hopefully with randomly generated salt. I explain what that all means in this video. I guess you also learn hacking techniques by proxy in this video.

When it comes down to it, you never can be fully sure if web services are actually doing user credentials in a secure way. Always be safe when using different services and use different passwords.

"Property" doesn't mean anything if you consider intellectual property property. If you want to exploit American law to get free money, be my guest, but don't LARP as if you have some universal moral right to extract money from everyone that thinks an idea you first thought, or hums a tune you wrote or makes software based off of yours.
