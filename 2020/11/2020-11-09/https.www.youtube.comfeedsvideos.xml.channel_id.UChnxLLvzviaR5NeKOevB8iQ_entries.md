Eurorack clock, gate, reset, and run are important parts of a Eurorack system, but not a lot of people consider them when building up their rack. I want to talk about what clock is, how it works, and what we can do with it.

00:00 - intro to clock (0-coast and noodblebox)
06:14 - intermediate clock (syncing sequencers and creative gates)
23:41 - advanced clock (big rack)
