## My Family, the Holocaust and Me with Robert Rinder review – remarkably moving TV

<p>On Who Do You Think You Are?, the barrister and television personality learned of his family’s painful past. In this new series, he and others in similar situations delve deeper still</p><p>In 2018, Robert “Judge” Rinder took part in the BBC series Who Do You Think You Are?, discovering the story of his maternal grandfather, a Holocaust survivor who found a new life in the Lake District as one of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/05/windermere-children-arek-hersh-survivor-bbc-drama">the 300 Windermere children</a>. It was a gripping episode – tragic and hopeful – and one of the best the series had done yet. In My Family, the Holocaust and Me (BBC One), a two-part series, Rinder delves further into the stories of his ancestors and helps other descendants of Holocaust victims and survivors to find out the family stories they had previously heard only in hints and whispers.</p><p>It is a remarkably moving endeavour, although, given its subject, that is hardly surprising. Rinder sets out to learn what happened to the family on his paternal grandfather’s side. When he visits Harry Rinder in his flat in London, the camera cuts briefly to a photo on the side, of Robert in his wig and robes. His grandfather was an “original cockney”, born in Stepney in 1928, and his grandfather, in turn, was from Lithuania. They do not know what happened to that side of the family, but Harry gives his blessing for his grandson to visit Lithuania, and the town where the family once lived, to investigate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/09/my-family-the-holocaust-and-me-with-robert-rinder-review-remarkably-moving-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In this new and fearful landscape anything seems possible, even the notion that Tottenham are genuine title contenders </p><p>As a coach who prides himself on being at the cutting edge of new trends and ideas within the game, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/josemourinho/">José Mourinho joined Instagram</a> in February 2020. We soon learned that this would not be an account dedicated to the classic Instagram tropes of good vibes, fabulous sunsets, body-positivity and paleo-breakfasts. Instead, in among the adverts for watches and credit cards, Mourinho’s main source of content appears to be his own face, captured in various states of cheerlessness. On the team bus, looking grumpy after a defeat. On a sofa, glumly eating crisps out of a plastic tub. Forcing his staff, including a stony-faced Ledley King, to watch Formula One on a Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Even the more sincere posts carry an unnerving import. Last month, for example, Mourinho wrote on behalf of the World Food Programme, pointing out that “842 million people in the world do not eat enough to be healthy”. Curiously, though, the post was accompanied by photographs of Mourinho himself eating, as if demonstrating how it should be done. Three Premier Leagues, two Champions Leagues, one bowl of food: respect, man, respect.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/09/pandemic-football-suits-jose-mourinho-a-man-at-home-in-sinister-circumstances">Continue reading...</a>

The results of the trials were very promising, he said, but there was still a long way to go before a vaccination programme could be rolled out nationwide.

It was coherent, informative and in less than five minutes Biden had told Americans just about everything they needed to know.</p><p>Boris Johnson likes to do things rather differently. Almost to the second after Biden had finished speaking, the prime minister stepped out into the Downing Street briefing room, flanked by the deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, and Brigadier Joe Fossey, dressed in full camo gear that had the reverse effect of drawing attention to himself.

<p>Britain risks isolation as the president-elect prioritises relations with the EU. The government must understand the signs of the new times <br /></p><p>The Irish question has played havoc with the best-laid plans of hardline Brexiters. Since 2016, successive Conservative governments have struggled to square the circle of keeping the United Kingdom intact, while avoiding the reimposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. The <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-53724381" title="">border issue</a> has been the achilles heel of Brexit, the thorn in the side of true believers in a “clean break” with the EU. So the prospect of an Irish-American politician on his way to the White House, just as Boris Johnson attempts to finagle his way round the problem, is an 11th-hour plot twist to savour.</p><p>Joe Biden’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54868002" title="">views</a> on Brexit are well known. The president-elect judges it to be a damaging act of self-isolation; strategically unwise for Britain and unhelpful to American interests in Europe. But it is the impact of the UK’s departure from the EU on Ireland that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/joe-biden-brexit-good-friday-agreement-trade-deal-b457753.html" title="">concerns</a> Mr Biden most. This autumn, he was forthright on the subject of the government’s controversial internal market bill, which was again debated on Monday in the House of Lords. The proposed legislation effectively reneges on a legally binding protocol signed with the EU, which would impose customs checks on goods travelling between Britain and Northern Ireland. In doing so, it summons up the spectre of a hard border on the island of Ireland, undermining the Good Friday agreement. Mr Biden is adamant that the GFA must not “become a casualty of Brexit”. He is expected to convey that message, in forceful terms, when his first telephone conversation with Mr Johnson eventually takes place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/09/the-guardian-view-on-johnsons-biden-problem-not-going-away">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>PC, PS4, Switch: Edelweiss<br /></strong>This unusual take on virtual farming has you battling demons – when you’re not tending to rice paddies</p><p>Another entrant in the (surprisingly populated) virtual farming genre this year is Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin, a combat-heavy take from Japanese indie duo Edelweiss. Banished from the celestial capital for a regrettable pyrotechnical transgression, the arrogant harvest-warrior goddess Sakuna must purify a demon-infested island while reluctantly sheltering a band of helpful but annoying humans. It’s a grand premise for a game that’s really about the mundane things in life.</p><p>You explore said island (and kill said demons) with a shawl that is also a grappling hook (stay with me).

<p>It should have been La Liga’s game of the weekend but 10 positive tests left the high-flyers struggling to field a team</p><p>When kick-off finally came around on Sunday, Granada were without their manager, assistant manager, matchday delegate and physio. They didn’t have their captain, vice-captain or goalkeeper. They didn’t have the second keeper either, or the third, or the fourth. Most of all they didn’t have a choice. And by the time the final whistle went on a game they hadn’t wanted to play they didn’t have a team – not a legal one, anyway. When the match finished, there were only four members of the senior squad on the pitch and that breaks the rules, which is why this <em>still</em> might not have ended yet.</p><p>Granada’s visit to Anoeta should have been among the games of the weekend, a celebration of the two biggest success stories this season and last: first versus sixth, back from European victories. Instead, it became a cautionary tale, a warning of what will probably happen again in Covid times. A “strange”, “uncomfortable” and “difficult” afternoon in the words of Real Sociedad’s manager, Imanol Alguacil, whose wonderful side – scorers of 14 goals in the previous four matches – returned to the top with a 2-0 win that could become 3-0 if Granada are forced to forfeit the game for fielding an ineligible lineup.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/09/ravaged-by-covid-and-beaten-by-real-sociedad-granadas-cautionary-tale">Continue reading...</a>

But Abrams has another identity: the novelist Selena Montgomery, a romance and thriller writer who has sold more than 100,000 copies of her eight novels.</p><p>Abrams wrote her first novel during her third year at Yale Law School, inspired after reading her ex-boyfriend’s PhD dissertation in chemical physics. She had wanted to write a spy novel: “For me, for other young black girls, I wanted to write books that showed them to be as adventurous and attractive as any white woman,” she wrote in her memoir Minority Leader. But after being told repeatedly by editors that women don’t read spy novels, and that men don’t read spy novels by women, she made her spies fall in love. Rules of Engagement, her debut, was published in 2001, and sees temperatures flare as covert operative Raleigh partners with the handsome Adam Grayson to infiltrate a terrorist group that has stolen deadly environmental technology.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/nov/09/stacey-abrams-georgia-political-heroine-and-romance-author-selena-montgomery">Continue reading...</a>

## Will Joe Biden be good for Britain? Here's what my time with him in Washington taught me | Kim Darroch

<p>From what I learned as the UK’s ambassador to the US, he’s a pragmatist.

Bannon was then at the height of his powers: the self-proclaimed architect of Trump’s triumph, chief strategist and senior counsellor to the incoming president, the man always “in the room”.</p><p>We did the business quickly: getting Bannon’s support for a Theresa May visit to Washington a week after inauguration. To spin out the meeting, I asked him about rumours of his links to some of Europe’s far-right parties: the Front National, Alternative für Deutschland, Lega Nord. Bannon feigned surprise at the question: “of course” he was talking to them. They were part of the great populist wave that was sweeping over western democracies, capitalising on the complacency and corruption of ruling elites, and already cresting with Brexit and Trump’s election. Next stop would be a victory for the Front National in the French elections in May 2017.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/09/joe-biden-britain-washington">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘They offered me a prosthetic testicle for the fashion show scene but I thought, what’s the point?

We’d entertain each other playing PlayStation and telling stories of our youth, so we decided to scratch an itch and write a sitcom about being teenagers trapped in suburbia. Channel 4 commissioned a pilot – which ended up as <a href="https://inbetweeners.fandom.com/wiki/Bunk_Off">Bunk Off,</a> the second episode of the first series of The Inbetweeners. A lot of the things in that episode had happened to Damon. He did draw on a girl’s driveway. He did tell a child their parents would be obliterated in a nuclear disaster.

<p>Thinner, and less stodgy, than a standard cheesecake, this delight highlights the flavour of the citrus-zested cream cheese and gingery vanilla crumb</p><p>Cheesecakes are tricky beasts. One moment too sweet, the next too creamy, and sometimes that crucially crisp biscuit base goes soggy: it is hard to get them right. I often find they are over-filled, leaving me slumped in my seat. But this one is different: a cheesecake tart with a shallower filling than normal. There’s enough sugar to sweeten, but not so much as to spoil the flavour of the cream cheese. It has a delicious, caramelised, gingery base, and a filling spiked with lemon zest and vanilla. I love it, and hope you will, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/09/thomasina-miers-recipe-for-ginger-crusted-lemon-cheesecake-tart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Nigella to Heston, British television has been dominated by chefs – but there can be only one who reigns supreme<br /></p><p>We should probably preface this by pointing out that the very notion of a “TV chef” is a peculiar modern invention. Being a TV chef isn’t necessarily about being an actual chef at all, but a chimeric blend of mediums: some are natural writers who TV execs realised would also be natural broadcasters (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/oct/10/nigella-lawson-i-didnt-think-id-be-a-mended-person-but-i-am">Nigella Lawson</a>, back with a new BBC series this week); some are essentially reading out their columns, ASMR style, with the backdrop of a nice garden (Nigel Slater); some are chefs so obsessed with the exotica of travel that in another era they would likely have been mid-ranking colonial governors somewhere in the British Raj (Rick Stein). <br /><br />The true golden age of the TV chef came somewhere in the late 90s, with the emergence of chefs who seemed to have been purpose-built for TV. Watching Ready Steady Cook, you never got the impression that Antony Worrall Thompson, Brian Turner and Nick Nairn were successful chefs running acclaimed kitchens, even though in reality they were; they simply existed as avatars of dad-banter who knew their way around a pot and pan. Remember, this was an era before the likes of Gordon Ramsay and Heston Blumenthal, when being a TV chef meant you could partake in gunge-related activities and strip nude in front of a baying audience of middle-aged mums for a charity telethon, and everyone thought it was an extremely normal thing to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/09/too-many-cooks-who-is-the-best-tv-chef">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Artificial intelligence is being used to create new songs seemingly performed by Frank Sinatra and other dead stars. ‘Deepfakes’ are cute tricks – but they could change pop for ever</p><p>‘It’s Christmas time! It’s hot tub time!” sings Frank Sinatra. At least, it sounds like him. With an easy swing, cheery bonhomie, and understated brass and string flourishes, this could just about pass as some long lost Sinatra demo. Even the voice – that rich tone once described as “all <em>legato</em> and regrets” – is eerily familiar, even if it does lurch between keys and, at times, sounds as if it was recorded at the bottom of a swimming pool.</p><p>The song in question not a genuine track, but a convincing fake created by “research and deployment company” OpenAI, whose Jukebox project uses artificial intelligence to generate music, complete with lyrics, in a variety of genres and artist styles. Along with Sinatra, they’ve done what are known as “deepfakes” of Katy Perry, Elvis, Simon and Garfunkel, 2Pac, Céline Dion and more. Having trained the model using 1.2m songs scraped from the web, complete with the corresponding lyrics and metadata, it can output raw audio several minutes long based on whatever you feed it. Input, say, Queen or Dolly Parton or Mozart, and you’ll get an approximation out the other end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/09/deepfake-pop-music-artificial-intelligence-ai-frank-sinatra">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy’s recipe for eggs in tomato sauce | A kitchen in Rome

<p>Tripe cooked in tomato sauce is a common dish in Rome, but not everyone likes offal, so thin egg omelettes, cut into strips, make a handy substitute</p><p>This isn’t a column about tripe. But also, it <em>is</em> a column about tripe. Half honeycomb, half rug-that-has-been-forgotten-on-the-washing-line-in-the-rain, tripe, its form and function, is fascinating and precious. Despite changing habits, tripe remains pretty ordinary in Rome, even for those who don’t eat it. It is as much the part of a butcher’s counter or supermarket shelf as chicken, sausages, chops and minced beef. Seeing the honeycomb rug sitting in folds behind the curved glass counter, I am reminded of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fergus-henderson">Fergus Henderson</a>’s words at the start of his book <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/nose-to-tail-eating-9780747572572.html">Nose To Tail Eating</a>. He explains that, given the book’s title, it would be disingenuous not to eat the whole beast; that there is a set of delights, textural and flavoursome, beyond the fillet. Quoting this isn’t to say I don’t have thoughts, many of them conflicting, about tripe, and about meat in general, but complicated thoughts about meat are useful, I think – now more than ever.</p><p>Also complicated are my thoughts about tripe’s texture – what <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fuchsia-dunlop">Fuchsia Dunlop</a> calls “the rubber factor” – but, again, this is an entirely welcome thing, the texture like rubbery cheese meeting velvet mushroom with a cartilage crunch. I like to think my love of it was passed on by my <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/feb/15/cheese-and-onion-pie-recipe-rachel-roddy-a-kitchen-in-rome">Lancastrian grandparents,</a> who bought tripe from United Cow Products and ate it with vinegar.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/09/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-eggs-in-tomato-sauce">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After days of tense counting in key states, Joe Biden was confirmed as the winner of the US election, beating the incumbent Donald Trump. But as David Smith explains, his job of uniting the country begins now – and it won’t be easy</p><p>In the end it came down to Joe Biden’s home state of Pennsylvania. Having patiently waited for mail-in ballots to be counted in a series of undeclared swing states, he received the call on Saturday morning that he and his running mate, Kamala Harris, would be heading to the White House. Crowds erupted with joy on the streets of some of America’s biggest cities as people gathered to celebrate the end of the Donald Trump era.</p><p>The Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, <strong>David Smith, </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that when Biden formally takes charge in January he will be beset by some of the biggest crises the country has faced in recent history. A pandemic that has killed more than 250,000 Americans, an economy devastated, a climate rapidly overheating and a population divided. It’s a task that would be difficult at the best of times, but he must face the prospect of having to navigate it without a majority in the Senate. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/09/us-election-2020-can-joe-biden-unite-america">Continue reading...</a>
