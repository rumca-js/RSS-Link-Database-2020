Thanksgiving

A shared, indoor meal

Inter-household mixing 

Ian Mackay, Virologist, University of Queensland

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/11/25/covid-world-reaction-us-thanksgiving/

From Australia, this looks like a mindbogglingly dangerous chapter in the out-of-control American COVID-19 story

Sadly, for some, this will be a Thanksgiving that is remembered for all the wrong reasons

Australia, mass sporting events, Sydney Opera House reopening

This time we all know where the virus is, we know how bad it can be, and we can be sure that this event will cause more sickness and some deaths

The virus will thrive among all the chances to trigger superspreading events among households and larger gatherings and parties. This is its way.

Yap Boum, Cameroonian epidemiologist

The willingness of some Americans to risk their and their family’s health to gather for a single day has left him befuddled.

From my perspective, I found it really crazy

On one hand, you see the people dying, on the other hand … you see that the vaccine is close. Why can’t you wait despite, of course … the mental challenge?

Jennifer Beam Dowd, University of Oxford, Demographic Science

America is bracing for danger this week

Here we have time to encourage safe Christmas alternatives rather than family Russian roulette
