The Sony PS5 launched alongside the new Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S a few weeks ago. While it has been nearly impossible to get one with scalpers buying up every console available, many of us have been lucky enough to get our hands on a shiny new PS5 and Xbox Series console. The PS5 has cutting edge technology with an incredible AMD SoC based on Zen 2 and RDNA2 that offers stellar gaming performance with ray tracing, the option for 4K 120Hz and even 8K. But not everything is perfect with the PS5. The glossy plastic is horrid looking, the console can capture 4K gameplay but doesn't do so by default, the 667GB of user storage will run out soon, and more. Let's fix those issues in this PS5 troubleshooting video!
