As part of THE GREAT GIFT EXCHANGE, AsapSCIENCE are transported to a magical “Wrapshop” to wrap a charitable gift for blind creator Molly Burke. They’ll explore the science of blindness and, with help from The World’s Most Famous Gift Wrap Artist, design the PERFECT scientifically-engineered gift wrap!
