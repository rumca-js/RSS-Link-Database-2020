No matter how you feel about these films, there's no denying this is a reference quality release - the kind of films you put on to show off your home theater to your friends.  In this video, I share my thoughts on the video & audio quality, what’s in the packaging, my perspective on the trilogy, and a final recommendation.

If you’re a Middle-earth fan new to 4K, I recommend Cliff Broadway’s article at theonering.net: https://www.theonering.net/torwp/2020/11/26/109071-torns-4k-uhd-starter-guide/ 

The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies will release for the first time in 4K UHD on December 1, 2020.  4K Ultra HD showcases 4K resolution with High Dynamic Range (HDR) and a wider color spectrum, offering brighter, deeper, and more lifelike colors.  The 4K remastering process was overseen by Peter Jackson.

In Summer 2021, a six-film “Middle-earth” Ultimate Collectors’ Edition with new Bonus Content will be released.
