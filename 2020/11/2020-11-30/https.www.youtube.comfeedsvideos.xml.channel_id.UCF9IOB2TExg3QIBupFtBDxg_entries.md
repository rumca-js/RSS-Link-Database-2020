REACT-1 round 7 interim report: fall in prevalence of swab-positivity in England during national lockdown 

https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/institute-of-global-health-innovation/imperial_react1_r7_interim.pdf

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55124286

Second wave in England

High prevalence in the North with lower prevalence in the South

First in younger adults then school-aged children and older adults

Local tiered interventions were in place up to 5th November

REACT-1 

A repeated cross-sectional survey of swab-positivity

Random samples over England

13th – 24th November 2020

Results 

Swab tests, 105,123

Positives, 821

Raw prevalence = 0.78%

Weighted prevalence = 0.96%

Down from 1.23 at the start of November

Giving an R of 0.88

Halving time of 37 days

Now down to R = 0.71

Driven mainly by reductions in prevalence in northern regions

Prevalence approximately unchanged in the Midlands and London

Conclusion 

Overall, ~30% reduction in prevalence

Inter-regional heterogeneity has reduced

Average absolute prevalence remains high at ~1%

Certain groups had a higher chance of testing positive

Asian ethnicity

Most deprived neighbourhoods 

Largest households 

It estimated that

Roughly 96 people in every 10,000 had coronavirus, down from 132 per 10,000 just before lockdown

There were about 72,000 new infections a day, compared with 100,000 at the end of October

Cases, + 23,363

encouraging signs

These trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in and that lockdown has added to this effect
 
As we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay

It's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control

Thanksgiving + 7 days is Wednesday 2nd Deccember

Estimated incidence of COVID-19 illness and hospitalization — United States, February–September, 2020

https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa1780/6000389

Clinical Infectious Diseases, (accepted paper)

Laboratory confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is nationally notifiable

Reported case counts are recognized to be less than the true number

Methods

To estimate the cumulative incidence SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic illnesses, and hospitalizations

Laboratory-confirmed case counts that were reported nationally were adjusted:

sources of under-detection based on testing practices in inpatient and outpatient settings and assay sensitivity

Results

Nationally reported cases

February 27–September 30, 2020

One of every 2.5 hospitalized infections

One of every 7.1 non-hospitalized illnesses

Applying these multipliers along with data on the prevalence of asymptomatic infection from published systematic reviews…

we estimate that:

2.4 million hospitalizations

44.8 million symptomatic illnesses

and 52.9 million total infections may have occurred in the U.S. 

Conclusions

One in 8 or 13%, of total SARS-CoV-2 infections were recognized and reported through to the end of September 

30th November

Cases, 13, 142, 997

Cases, x 8 = 105, 143, 977

Deaths, 256,166

CFR = 1.95

IFR = 0.25

Older Adults

https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/older-adults.html

Eight out of 10 deaths I the US have been in older adults, over the age of 65
