swab-positivity in England during national lockdown \n\nhttps://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/institute-of-global-health-innovation/imperial_react1_r7_interim.pdf\n\nhttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-55124286\n\nSecond wave in England\n\nHigh prevalence in the North with lower prevalence in the South\n\nFirst in younger adults then school-aged children and older adults\n\nLocal tiered interventions were in place up to 5th November\n\nREACT-1 \n\nA repeated cross-sectional survey of swab-positivity\n\nRandom samples over England\n\n13th \u2013 24th November 2020\n\nResults \n\nSwab tests, 105,123\n\nPositives, 821\n\nRaw prevalence = 0.78%\n\nWeighted prevalence = 0.96%\n\nDown from 1.23 at the start of November\n\nGiving an R of 0.88\n\nHalving time of 37 days\n\nNow down to R = 0.71\n\nDriven mainly by reductions in prevalence in northern regions\n\nPrevalence approximately unchanged in the Midlands and London\n\nConclusion \n\nOverall, ~30% reduction in prevalence\n\nInter-regional heterogeneity has reduced\n\nAverage absolute prevalence remains high at ~1%\n\nCertain groups had a higher chance of testing positive\n\nAsian ethnicity\n\nMost deprived neighbourhoods \n\nLargest households \n\nIt estimated that\n\nRoughly 96 people in every 10,000 had coronavirus, down from 132 per 10,000 just before lockdown\n\nThere were about 72,000 new infections a day, compared with 100,000 at the

(Imperial)\n\nencouraging signs\n\nThese trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in and that lockdown has added to this effect\n \nAs we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay\n\nIt's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8KYWQICMMU", "date_published": "2020-11-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source":
