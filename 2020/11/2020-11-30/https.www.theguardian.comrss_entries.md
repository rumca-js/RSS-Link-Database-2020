## Lennon the fall guy for Celtic's failure to build on domestic dominance

<p>Ugly scenes after the League Cup defeat to Ross County reflected a growing sense of frustration among fans <br /></p><p>So much for managing Celtic as football’s equivalent to living on Easy Street. Fifteen years ago, Martin O’Neill’s tenure ended with a painful concession of the title on its final day to Rangers. Having stayed a season too long – even by his own admission – Gordon Strachan departed in 2009 with Rangers again the champions; the Celtic support were tired of one-liners and one-dimensional play.</p><p>Tony Mowbray toiled before being sacked. Having taken charge for the first time, Neil Lennon resigned in 2014 with the staleness of a one-horse race unable to stimulate him any longer. By the time the Ronny Deila project ended, two years later, there was acceptance that this punt was worthy of a smaller club. Celtic raised the bar in hiring Brendan Rodgers but there was only so long the current Leicester City manager would handle being the only fish in a small pond; internal rancour at the onset of season 2018-19 preceded the inevitable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/30/neil-lennon-the-fallguy-celtic-domestic-dominance-scottish-football">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Analysis: Charity leaders perplexed and angry as commission chair tells voluntary organisations to avoid picking sides on divisive issues </p><p>To say that relations have been strained between the charity sector and its regulator in England and Wales, the Charity Commission, is something of an understatement.

<p>From Madonna to Ian Brown, musicians seem to be drawn to wild theories about JFK and 5G.

The story has been suppressed, witnesses have been killed, and this is your country.” This incident, perhaps the first high-profile case of a musician airing a conspiracy theory, is one reason why Crosby was fired from the band. “He didn’t know anything more than anyone else,” grumbled frontman Roger McGuinn. “He was just trying to be Mr Cool up there.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/30/enemies-of-the-sheeple-why-do-pop-stars-fall-for-conspiracy-theories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Those pining for a return to the status quo have forgotten that US foreign policy disasters helped pave the way for Trump in the first place</p><p>The big question for the US president-elect, Joe Biden, who has taken “build back better” <a href="https://joebiden.com/build-back-better/">as his motto</a>, is whether this will mean genuine renovation or mere restoration. Americans desperately need a pivot after the madness of Donald Trump. And when Biden takes the reins of power from his predecessor, there is no doubt that a big reset will come. But the risk of complacent restoration is nowhere greater than in US foreign policy – especially since it is a domain in<strong> </strong>which the office of president has so much authority, even in the midst of legislative gridlock.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/10/donald-trump-mark-esper-foreign-policy-joe-biden-iran">Trump poised to leave legacy of chaos with last-minute foreign policy moves | Analysis</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/30/biden-america-is-back-team-insiders-repeat-mistakes-us-trump">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emma and Richard Showan met in October 2013 on the Metropolitan line tube train into London. They live in Aylesbury</p><p>When Emma Naks graduated in 2013, her love of reading led her to take an internship at the book department of a London auction house. “I was living with my parents in Buckinghamshire and took the Metropolitan line into work every day,” she says.</p><p>In September that year, she was spotted by Richard Showan, who lived in Chorleywood and worked as a lawyer in the West End. Although Emma had her nose in a book, he couldn’t miss her red lipstick. “She had all these feathers in her hair and looked very distinctive. I really wanted to talk to her, but I was too shy.” After a few days of seeing her every day on the tube, they caught each other’s eye and smiled. Emma was keeping a diary at the time and nicknamed him “awkward train guy”. “One day my sister caught the train with me and asked if ‘train guy’ was around. He was wearing a bad jumper, so I lied and said no, because I didn’t want her to judge,” she remembers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/30/how-we-met-i-stood-there-awkwardly-then-told-her-id-been-bitten-by-a-duck">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy's recipe for chestnut, mushroom and potato soup | A kitchen in Rome

<p>Chestnuts can be cooked in all sorts of joyful ways, and here they take the part of beans in a rich, autumnal soup</p><p>We can’t eat the spiky-coated horse chestnuts scattered all over the piazza. Nor the mushrooms that suddenly billow like bald umbrellas at the base of the nearby trees. Both, however, are daily reminders that now is the time that their sweet and edible siblings can be bought at the market and in shops. Then there is Augusto’s cabinet at his restaurant <a href="http://www.la-torricella.com/">La Torricella</a>, filled, as it is every year, with chestnuts from trees on his land in the neighbouring region of Abruzzo. Only this isn’t every year.</p><p>Once I have seen them, chestnuts call out to me at this time of year. Maybe because I know that a kilo, scored around their curve and roasted until the nut tries to escape, a bottle of red wine and a bar of chocolate is such a balanced meal, with no washing up. I might be contradicting <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/22/chestnut-and-chickpea-soup-recipe-kitchen-sink-tales-rachel-roddy">previous columns </a>in being undecided as to what is best – roasting chestnuts in a frying pan (which requires a lot of shaking) or in the oven (which requires moderate shaking) – so I swing between the two. Either way, I tip the hot, roasted chestnuts into a brown paper bag, then wrap it in a tea towel for 15 minutes, in which time the heat turns to steam, which eases the shells away and makes them easier to peel.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/30/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-chestnut-mushroom-and-potato-soup">Continue reading...</a>

But there is one game he remembers more fondly than anyone else does: the first he ever worked on.</p><p>“Terminator: Future Shock,” he says. “When [Bethesda] came to Fallout, people were saying, oh, you’re doing a post-apocalyptic open world! In 3D! But we already did that in Terminator. It’s an underrated game that not a lot of people played. I think Quake came out right afterwards, that might have had something to do with it, and understandably so … Future Shock was made with eight or 10 people and it did a lot of things that no game had done. I remember it got critiqued at the time, which annoyed me to be honest. But now the things it did are commonplace.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/nov/30/todd-howard-bethesda-starfield-future-games-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Mikel Arteta does not seem to have a plan of attack, Everton’s defence must improve and Jürgen Klopp should pick his battles</p><p>Mikel Arteta has been the Arsenal manager for just under a year, and though some things have improved under him – attitude, intensity, FA Cup tally – it’s still not clear what the plan is, especially going forward. And while it’s important to emphasise how much Thomas Partey is being missed, the feeling persists that it really doesn’t have to be like this. When Arteta was appointed, he was gifted half a season of minimal expectations, meaning he could experiment in order to find the personnel and formation best able to execute his ideals. But though he did brilliantly to win a trophy, he settled on very little, so his current position is not dissimilar to the one in which he began – except now, he’s under pressure. Maybe it is time to give Bukayo Saka, Reiss Nelson and Joe Willock extended runs because really, how much worse – and more tedious – could things get? <strong>Daniel Harris</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/30/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

Seven fans who sought love or friendship via music mag ‘lonely hearts’ ads tell us if they found what they were looking for</p><p>From headbangers in Hastings to new romantics in Norwich, pen pals and lonely hearts columns were a staple of music magazines from the 1970s to the 1990s. Hopeful, passionate and bored fans sent in their photos, names, addresses and obsessions for publication and crossed their fingers, hoping for a big response. Decades before the advent of online forums, fans would then exchange handwritten letters, gushing over the likes of Pat Benatar and Whitesnake. Teenage goths from Scunthorpe and Southend could fall in love, the ice broken by their shared love of Siouxsie and the Banshees. The ads would generally convey a passion for music, but between the lines were cries for connection, pleas for love.</p><p>As a music obsessive from a small Yorkshire town, I saw my own thoughts and feelings echoed in them and started wondering: what became of the seekers? Did they find rock’n’roll romance? Do they still love Bauhaus and Alien Sex Fiend? How did life work out?

## The Conservatives are hollowing the state and consolidating power: democracy is at stake | Andrew Fisher

<p>While Michael Gove quotes Marxist theorists, his party is undermining the liberal principles of truth, fairness and accountability<br /></p><p>Earlier this year Michael Gove surprised people by quoting the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci in a speech (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/06/michael-gove-gramsci-misses-point">the second time he has done so</a>), but readers of political theory may recognise that the Tories’ strategy owes more to another student of Gramsci: the German communist activist Rudi Dutschke. He coined the term “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_long_march_through_the_institutions">the long march through the institutions</a>” to describe the strategy of gaining a dominant position in each of the major institutions in society, in Gramscian terms, to gain hegemony.</p><p>The Tories started their long march in the 1980s by ripping through Britain’s socialist institutions: trade unions were shackled, publicly owned enterprise <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/29/short-history-of-privatisation">was privatised</a> and council housing was sold off. The results were clear: a few people got very rich, poverty rose and inequality widened. No subsequent government reversed these changes, instead bolstering them. As Tony Blair said of Thatcher: “I always thought my job was to build on some of the things she had done rather than reverse them.” Today, a generation of young people are less likely to own their own home and earn less than their parents’ generation, while paying exorbitant rents to parasitic landlords.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/30/tories-thatcher-democracy-michael-gove-marxist-theorists">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For weeks, the Guardian US reporter Sam Levin has been speaking to Bounchan Keola, who is being detained by Ice and facing deportation to Laos, a country he left when he was four, despite having risked his life to fight wildfires in California this year</p><p>The Guardian US reporter <strong>Sam Levin</strong> talks to <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>about<strong> </strong><strong>Bounchan Keola</strong>, who sustained a life-threatening injury on the frontline of a huge fire. Keola had just two weeks of his prison term remaining when he was crushed by a tree while battling the devastating Zogg blaze in northern <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> on 2 October and was airlifted to a hospital. Days later, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california">California</a> prison officials notified federal immigration agents that his release would be coming up and the state, records show, made arrangements to transfer him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice). He is now threatened with deportation to Laos, a country his family fled three decades ago.</p><p>Sam tells Rachel about the crime that put Keola in prison for 22 years and discusses California’s controversial policy of transferring certain foreign-born prisoners to Ice after they have completed their prison sentences – a practice the governor, Gavin Newsom, has supported. Lawmakers across the country, including the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, called on Newsom to end the transfers in September, in response to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/22/california-inmate-firefighter-ice-deportation">story of Kao Saelee</a>, another prison firefighter and Laotian refugee sent to Ice. Rachel hears from Keola, who talks about the fire that nearly took his life, and his sister <strong>Thongsouk Keola,</strong> who says Boun deserves a second chance. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/30/he-risked-his-life-fighting-the-californian-wildfires-now-he-faces-deportation">Continue reading...</a>
