swab-positivity in England during national lockdown

England\n\nHigh prevalence in the North with lower prevalence in the South\n\nFirst in younger adults then school-aged children and older adults\n\nLocal tiered interventions were in place up to 5th November\n\nREACT-1 \n\nA repeated cross-sectional survey of swab-positivity\n\nRandom samples over England\n\n13th \u2013 24th November 2020\n\nResults \n\nSwab tests, 105,123\n\nPositives, 821\n\nRaw prevalence = 0.78%\n\nWeighted prevalence = 0.96%\n\nDown from 1.23 at the start of November\n\nGiving an R of 0.88\n\nHalving time of 37 days\n\nNow down to R = 0.71\n\nDriven mainly by reductions in prevalence in northern regions\n\nPrevalence approximately unchanged in the Midlands and London\n\nConclusion \n\nOverall, ~30% reduction in prevalence\n\nInter-regional heterogeneity has reduced\n\nAverage absolute prevalence remains high at ~1%\n\nCertain groups had a higher chance of testing positive\n\nAsian ethnicity\n\nMost deprived neighbourhoods \n\nLargest households \n\nIt estimated that\n\nRoughly 96 people in every 10,000 had coronavirus, down from 132 per 10,000 just before lockdown\n\nThere were about 72,000 new infections a day, compared with 100,000 at the end of October\n\nTracker app (King\u2019s)\n\nhttps://covid.joinzoe.com/data#levels-over-time\n\nCases, + 23,363\n\nOfficial data\n\nhttps://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/cases\n\nProf Paul Elliott (Imperial)\n\nencouraging signs\n\nThese trends suggest that the tiered approach helped to curb infections in and that lockdown has added to this effect\n \nAs we approach a challenging time of year, it's even more vital that through our actions and behaviours we all play our part in helping to keep the virus at bay\n\nIt's really important in the run-up to Christmas that we keep the virus under control", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8KYWQICMMU", "date_published": "2020-11-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source":

substantially lower levels of virus in their upper respiratory tracts than symptomatic children \n\nIn the US, symptomatic index cases resulted in transmission to approximately 53% of household members \n\nSARS-CoV-2 may be spread by conversation and exhalation \n\nMost transmission indoors, offices, restaurants, bars, gyms\n\nClusters are often associated with large indoor gatherings \n\nUndetected cases play a major role in transmission\n\nMost cases are not reported\n\nIndividuals who have clinically recovered but test positive for COVID-19 are unlikely to be infectious\n\nWe need to know\n\nRelative contribution of different routes of transmission (e.g., fomites, aerosols, droplets)\n \nHow common is transmission from bodily fluids like semen, urine, and feces?\n\nHow infectious are young children compared to adults?\n\nWhat is the emission rate of infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles while breathing, talking, coughing, singing, or exercising\n\ntaking into account variation in viral load in the upper and lower respiratory tract?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C2KH3Xt3W0", "date_published": "2020-11-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user":
