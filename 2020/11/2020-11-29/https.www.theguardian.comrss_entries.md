## The more the Tories' cronyism is indulged, the more their sense of entitlement grows | Nesrine Malik

<p>Whether it’s the chumocracy or just incompetence, ‘we’re getting on with the job’ is the government’s cover for all its sins<br /></p><p>It’s hard to keep up. Barely a year into this government’s tenure, and Conservative <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/21/tories-covid-contracts-public-trust-government">chumocracy violations</a>, accelerated by the pandemic – indeed, under the cover of the pandemic – are claimed on an almost weekly basis. The figures are staggering. So far, it is estimated that the government, without a transparent tendering process, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/nov/18/ppe-suppliers-with-political-ties-given-high-priority-status-report-reveals">handed out £18bn</a> in coronavirus-related contracts during the first six months of the pandemic alone. Of this, £1.5bn can be traced to companies or individuals with connections to the Conservative party.</p><p>Within those billions there is more shocking detail. A spider’s web of unqualified Tory donors, university friends, neighbours and local pub owners has been entrusted with everything from the provision of PPE to the manufacturing of medical equipment. The tendering process seems to have been jettisoned for random phone calls and texts from opportunists, with ministers too lazy to go through due process and too arrogant to care. They say political parties campaign in poetry and govern in prose. This Conservative government campaigned in slogans and governs in WhatsApp messages.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/29/covid-pandemic-tory-chumocracy-cronyism-spin">Continue reading...</a>

With Johnny Sexton still sidelined, the lock James Ryan captains Ireland at home for the first time. Jacob Stockdale is restored at full-back, Hugo Keenan starts on the right wing and Keith Earls on the left. Stuart McCloskey is at inside centre alongside Chris Farrell at No 13 with McCloskey’s provincial colleague, Billy Burns, making his full debut at No 10. Conor Murray is at scrum-half.</p><p>Finlay Bealham plays loosehead prop, with Rob Herring and Andrew Porter completing the front row. Iain Henderson is alongside Ryan in the second row and lastly, in the back row, CJ Stander switches to No 8 with Will Connors at No 7 and Tadhg Beirne on the blindside. Shane Daly of Munster is poised to make his debut off the replacements bench.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-11-29T13:23:14.132Z">1.23pm <span class="timezone">GMT</span></time> </p><p>In the build-up to this afternoon’s meeting with Georgia, the Ireland forwards coach John Fogarty said they are ‘expecting a battle up front’, which is not the most insightful pre-match analysis you will ever hear. This Georgian side is famous for its forward muscle. But sarcasm aside, this is a big day for Ireland, who need to reassert themselves following that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/21/england-ireland-autumn-nations-cup-rugby-union-match-report">pasting at Twickenham</a> last week. <br /><br />It’s an especially big day for the Ulster fly-half Billy Burns, who will make his full debut, and overall for an Ireland side which features nine changes. By extension it’s a big day for Andy Farrell and his coaching team who need to show that progress is being made and that they are developing a new identity post-Joe Schmidt. </p><p>A criticism of their performance at Twickenham last week is they played into English hands by running straight and looking for contact. Perhaps such a policy would pay off today, given Georgia’s inferior fitness to England, but then again Ireland might do well to chuck the ball around a bit as well. England cannot be caught atop Group A, so it would make sense to put some emphasis on entertainment as well as achieving the right result at the Aviva Stadium, Lansdowne Road in old money.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/nov/29/ireland-v-georgia-autumn-nations-cup-live">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A retreat for grieving parents provides therapeutic benefits, writes a mother whose daughter was stillborn 22 years ago</p><p>After my daughter Grace died when I was eight months pregnant, my first impulse was to write it all down: the birth, surrounded by candles; the coffin and funeral where there should have been a christening; how her death had been accompanied by snowdrops fighting their way through the frozen ground in the first stirring of spring. I felt I was the only one really to have known her and I wanted her acknowledged. I wrote a diary as a way of making my daughter real, and published it in a magazine. It helped.</p><p>I’ve since learned that this is a common impulse in the bereaved – especially among bereaved parents, who feel an urgent and deep-seated need to remember and honour their children.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/29/creative-therapy-and-shared-support-can-help-with-grief-after-losing-a-child">Continue reading...</a>

As if this isn’t eye-popping enough (our hero lives in mild-mannered Bucks, not ritzy Belgravia), the singer in question is happy to talk and even, perhaps, to flirt with him a little – not that he seems to notice. “You have a black mark on your face,” she tells him, rubbing at it with her thumb. “Oh, that,” he replies, obliviously. “That’s from the <em>Milton Keynes Mirror</em>.”</p><p><em>Similar to But Not</em> is the work of <a href="https://twitter.com/pbrainey/status/1310115390094180352">Paul Rainey</a>, who has entered the prize every year but one since its inception in 2007. “I’m so delighted,” he says of this long-awaited triumph. “Every year, I would always be in a really black mood at not winning. I would moan to all my friends, and vow never to enter again. But then I always would, and I’m glad I persevered. Winning is the best thing that’s ever happened to me.” Is his story, as it purports to be, autobiographical? “Yes, I’m afraid so. It recalls an intense daydream I had when I was 17. I’d seen Madonna on <em>Top of the Pops</em> [in 1985, when the story is set], and I wondered how I could possibly get to know her. This, believe it or not, seemed to be the only feasible idea I could come up with: that we’d meet in the pub, when no one else was around.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/29/you-need-to-look-outside-your-own-window-the-winner-of-our-graphic-short-story-prize-2020">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nutty flavours add a toasty warmth to kitchen treats, both savoury and sweet</p><p>The hazelnuts clatter into the warm, shallow pan and I start to toast them over a low heat. The browning seems to take forever at first, but I resist turning up the heat and continue to watch carefully, shaking the pan from time to time. Precious, plump little nuts, hazelnuts are expensive, and I really mustn’t allow them to burn again. Like cooking chickpeas from scratch, I burn hazelnuts as regularly as day turns to night. The alternative is to roast them in the oven, but I would rather have them close at hand, where I can keep an eye on their progress from white to biscuit brown.</p><p>The skinned nuts are getting a toasting to intensify their flavour. The difference between a raw nut and one you have lovingly bronzed over a low heat is astonishing and even more so when coated in dark chocolate or ground for a biscuit or cookie, which is I what I am doing today. The cookies are a much-needed treat; a batch of tiny round discs sandwiched together with a buttercream made from a paste of the nuts and sugar. And before that, there are roasted autumn vegetables with a nutty flavoured dressing of tahini and yogurt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/nov/29/nigel-slater-recipes-for-roast-roots-and-hazelnut-cookies">Continue reading...</a>

But whatever you do, don’t say she’s a late-bloomer</p><p>She’s a bad, bad momma. The matriarch of this bad family. A controlling, violent, <em>violent</em> woman…” says Lesley Manville, who has turned out to be spectacularly good at playing bad.

It is one of those grand Hollywood films, a western-slash-thriller, the kind of movie that meant Manville was offered a stunt double. After spending an hour in her company, it isn’t a surprise to discover she opted to do the stunts herself, surrounded, she says delightedly, by four Canadian firemen, who hid just off-camera.</p><p>“I’d never picked up a gun in my life,” she says, with a hint of fabulous theatre. “And of course Kevin [Costner, her co-star] is brilliant with all of that, fights and stunts. Kevin was very funny, because he was showing me how to use the gun and I played up the girly bit, because it was just too delicious not to.” She chuckles. “And then when I was pointing the gun at him and being all Blanche, he looked at me and he said…” Here she puts on a deep, movie-star, American drawl: “Well, you sure don’t look like you’ve never held a gun before to me, lady.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/29/lesley-manville-i-was-always-quite-savvy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Four-letter words were once rebellious and cool, but the denizens of the finance sector have put paid to that</p><p>Does Prince Charles ever swear at his plants, I wonder. Somehow I doubt it. We all know he talks to them, of course, because he said so in an interview in 1986 when discussing his garden. “I just come and talk to the plants, really,” he said. “Very important to talk to them. They respond.” This much-mocked revelation was supplemented only last year when the panel show <em>QI </em>tweeted that he also shakes hands with trees. At tree-planting ceremonies, he apparently always gives a branch a bit of a waggle to wish it well.</p><p>This all makes perfect sense to me. It’s no surprise that a man in his position, when presented with an array of silent and quivering organisms, automatically starts chatting and shaking limbs. That’s what almost all royal events must be like. The nervous crowd he’s presented with when he gets out of the Bentley to cut a ribbon isn’t going to be significantly more responsive than your average clump of dahlias. He’s been instinctively filling silences with inane chatter all his life and it’s vital for his self-esteem to believe that, on some level, these mute lifeforms appreciate the effort.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/29/trust-a-bunch-of-bankers-to-give-swearing-a-bad-name">Continue reading...</a>

## Julien Temple: 'People who are considered difficult are very rich subjects for a film'

<p>The film-maker on his new documentary about the former Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan, Johnny Depp’s role in it, and why he’s still hungry to create<br /><br /></p><p>When film-maker Julien Temple met Shane MacGowan to discuss making a documentary about his life, the 62-year-old, hard-living former Pogues frontman was watching a David Attenborough programme about snow leopards. The image has stayed with Temple: many times, while making <em>Crock of Gold: A Few Rounds </em><em>With Shane MacGowan</em>, he found himself feeling like a naturalist stalking an elusive species. The film, though, is a hugely entertaining and revealing one. While MacGowan wouldn’t sit still for Temple, he would for friends and fans such as Johnny Depp, Gerry Adams and Primal Scream’s Bobby Gillespie. Temple has made acclaimed documentaries on the Sex Pistols and the Clash, as well as the cult feature film <em>Absolute Beginners</em>. He’s 67 and lives in Somerset.</p><p><strong>Just how chaotic was it making a film with Shane MacGowan?<br /></strong>I knew it was going to be difficult going into it, so I can’t really blame anyone other than myself. Obviously, periods of turbulence were experienced. He’s a difficult guy on a lot of levels, but I guess that’s what makes him great. If you can weather the abuse and stay focused on the film, he’s definitely a subject who deserves respect. And he’s a subject for an exciting film, I believe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/29/julien-temple-crock-of-gold-shane-macgowan-documentary-interview">Continue reading...</a>

Why, in early autumn, were you more likely to be infected if you lived there? In part, this might be due to the seasonal nature of the virus and autumn comes first to the north.

The Swiss bank UBS calculates that the already vast fortunes of the world’s billionaires had <a href="https://www.ubs.com/global/en/wealth-management/uhnw/billionaires-report/billionaires-insights-2020.html" title="">surged to a record</a> $10.2tn by the end of this July.

If you and those you love have avoided being a victim of the virus and you’ve kept a well-paid job that can be performed from a comfortable home, the worst there is to complain about is Zoom fatigue. The rise in the savings ratio suggests you have probably been accumulating money. Your financial safety net will have improved because you haven’t been able to spend as much as usual on nice meals out, evenings at the cinema or theatre or going on holidays.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/29/rishi-sunak-reverted-to-tory-type-when-he-chose-to-leave-world-poor-behind">Continue reading...</a>

<p>They’re too young to vote or drive. But meet the children writing computer programs to track our health and wellbeing, choose a new school… and even how to cheat at online games</p><p>I started getting interested in coding when I was about 11. I joined a local community lab where biologists and computer scientists come together and conduct experiments. I wanted to join the lab because my brother was really into biology and at the time I wanted to be exactly like him. I was too young to participate in the experiments, so my mentor pushed me more towards coding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/29/coding-the-future-the-tech-kids-solving-lifes-problems">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jack Merritt devoted his short working life to transforming the hopes of prisoners. On the anniversary of his death, family, friends and ex-offenders talk about continuing his legacy</p><p>Dave and Anne Merritt weren’t sure how to mark today’s anniversary of the murder of their beloved son Jack. Milestone days are always the hardest. Unlike the day that would have been his 26th birthday, at the beginning of October, when they and their younger son Joe and Jack’s girlfriend, Leanne O’Brien, went for a long walk at one of his favourite places on the Suffolk coast, there are no good memories associated with 29 November. But still, Dave told me a week ago, with typical resolve: “We do want to try to somehow confront it.”</p><p>Jack, he says, was always making stuff: music, art, food. So they are inviting people to join in today with “Creating with Jack Merritt”, “whether that’s painting a picture or making up a new cocktail or doing a bit of creative writing”. The plan is to share the collective results on Instagram. “We don’t want to just spend the day thinking about the day,” Dave says. “I’m sure it will be very upsetting. But it’ll be as good a day as we can make it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/29/london-bridge-attack-one-year-anniversary-jack-dave-anne-merritt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Christmas comes early with two gloriously indulgent gourmet boxes sent from Lancashire</p><p><strong>Northcote at Home. Book by 10am Friday for delivery the next week (</strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.northcote.com/">northcote.com</a></strong></em><strong>). Autumn gourmet box for two £90, classic menu for two £105, delivery £10</strong></p><p>The doorbell rings and Christmas arrives early, enclosed in two sturdy, cardboard boxes.
