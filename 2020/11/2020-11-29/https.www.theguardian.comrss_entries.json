This Georgian side is famous for its forward muscle. But sarcasm aside, this is a big day for Ireland, who need to reassert themselves following that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/21/england-ireland-autumn-nations-cup-rugby-union-match-report\">pasting at Twickenham</a> last week. <br /><br />It\u2019s an especially big day for the Ulster fly-half Billy Burns, who will make his full debut, and overall for an Ireland side which features nine changes. By extension it\u2019s a big day for Andy Farrell and his coaching team who need to show that progress is being made and that they are developing a new identity post-Joe Schmidt. </p><p>A criticism of their performance at Twickenham last week is they played into English hands by running straight and looking for contact. Perhaps such a policy would pay off today, given Georgia\u2019s inferior fitness to England, but then again Ireland might do well to chuck the ball around a bit as well. England cannot be caught atop Group A, so it would make sense to put some emphasis on entertainment as well as achieving the right result at the Aviva Stadium, Lansdowne Road in old money.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/nov/29/ireland-v-georgia-autumn-nations-cup-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/nov/29/ireland-v-georgia-autumn-nations-cup-live", "date_published": "2020-11-29 13:36:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "South Africa v England: second men's T20 international \u2013 live!", "description": "<ul><li>Live updates from Boland Park, Paarl, 12.30pm GMT start</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/nov/28/sam-curran-england-t20-south-africa-ipl\">Sam Curran says IPL made him stronger for T20s in South Africa</a></li><li>Feel free to <a href=\"mailto:tanya.aldred.freelance@theguardian.com\">email Tanya</a> or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tjaldred\">@TJAldred</a><br /><ul><br /></ul></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-11-29T13:36:03.335Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p><p><strong>14th over: South Africa 97-5 (Linde 2, van der Dussen 12) </strong>Things slip-slipping away here for South Africa, with just the bowlers left to have a bat.
