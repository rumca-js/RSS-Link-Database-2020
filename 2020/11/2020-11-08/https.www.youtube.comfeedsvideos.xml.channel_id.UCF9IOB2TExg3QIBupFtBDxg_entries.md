All UK hospitals ordered to isolate new mutation

immediate action

Patients from Denmark must be isolated, treated in specialist centres, sequenced

Cluster 5, 12 cases, (8 + 4)

Passenger planes, ships and lorries carrying freight from Denmark will also not be allowed across the border

Anyone who travelled to Denmark within the last two weeks: 

No routine outpatient, ambulatory or primary care

Anyone who needs urgent hospital treatment: 

Should be separated from other patients and

managed in strict isolation in a single room with en-suite bathroom facilities

If the person subsequently tests positive for Covid:

Immediately be transferred to a specialised infectious diseases centre

Ended in the early noughties

Professor Fiona Mathews, Mammal Society

There's a chance it might have jumped to cousins of the mink, like otters

We know the virus came from animals, so it would be foolish not to look at whether it is already here

And of course there's a small chance that it might pose a risk to humans

Free supplies of vitamin D

https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/11/07/vitamin-d-delivered-millions-vulnerable-people-help-protect/

Scotland and now England

Delivered, 2.2 million over winter from December

Four-month supplies to be delivered directly

Boris Johnson

We are indeed looking at the possible beneficial effects of vitamin D, and ... we will be updating the House shortly

He is entirely right that we are indeed looking at the possible beneficial effects of vitamin D

Government expected to commission clinical trials

June, National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (Nice)

Insufficient evidence to recommend that vitamin D protects against the virus

Matt Hancock

I have asked the scientists to look once again at the impact of vitamin D on resistance and immunity. 

There has been some updated evidence that has come to light in the past few weeks, and I want to ensure that it is fully taken into account

David Davis

The Scottish Government are sending four months supply of vitamin D to everybody who shielded in Scotland

Given that it is low cost and there is no medical downside, will our Government consider the same approach in England?

Are we over the peak of the second wave?

Over a million reports

13,108 recent swab tests

Overall UK figures starting to fall

Two weeks up to 1st November

New cases, 42,049, down from 43,569

Now

37,132

North of England and Scotland

Daily new cases has fallen in the last week

South East and South West

Daily new caser rising slowly, but continue to be much lower than other regions in the UK

UK R value is 1.0 

England, 1.0

Wales, 1.0

Scotland, 0.9

Age

Infections have stopped increasing in most age groups

Modest increases in over 60s

Tim Spector

The worst affected areas have shown the most improvement, but large differences between regions remain

We are two weeks ahead of hospital data and four weeks ahead of most deaths

We urge everyone to respect the restrictions and help get the number of cases down as soon as possible to help the NHS, end the lockdown and get us in good shape for December

UK, Missing 50% of cases

Professor Mark Woolhouse, Edinburgh

Therefore not self-isolating

Mild or asymptomatic

Symptomatic but genuinely don’t recognise

Having symptoms and actually ignoring them

The idea of Liverpool is to try and find these cases and hopefully ... persuade them to self-isolate
