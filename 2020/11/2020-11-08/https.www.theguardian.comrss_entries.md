<ul><li>Manager accepts full responsibility for 3-0 loss</li><li>‘I didn’t see my team out there. They wanted it more’</li></ul><p>Mikel Arteta described Arsenal’s 3-0 home defeat by Aston Villa as the worst of his managerial career but was at a loss to explain a performance in which – as he put it – “I didn’t see my team out there”. Arsenal were second best in every department and Arteta was scathing about his team’s attitude as well as their execution.</p><p>“They wanted it more than us,” he said. “I’m struggling to find the reason, but obviously there was something there. If you can’t defend your box, it’s a really complicated way to win matches. We haven’t been scoring a lot of goals and today we looked open in transition, and if you don’t put chances away you have no chance to win. I take full responsibility.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/08/mikel-arteta-laments-worst-defeat-after-arsenal-are-thrashed-by-aston-villa">Continue reading...</a>

## The Trials of Oscar Pistorius review – what about Reeva Steenkamp?

<p>This docuseries could have asked bigger questions on domestic violence, or the murder of Pistorius’s scarcely mentioned girlfriend.

If you did not know the story, you would probably have thought you were about to watch a re-examination of a murder investigation gone wrong and the righting of a terrible miscarriage of justice. The BBC eventually apologised and replaced the advert with something they said was more representative of the tone of the film.</p><p>They should just have left it. It was a meretricious trailer for a meretricious film by a director – Daniel Gordon – who, in one of the press interviews for the series, said he was <a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/09/27/30-for-30-oscar-pistorius-espn-daniel-gordon/">“still flip-flopping”</a> on the matter of Pistorius’s guilt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/08/the-trials-of-oscar-pistorius-review-what-about-reeva-steenkamp">Continue reading...</a>

If it means torturing a witch with the scariest pair of tweezers ever seen on TV, so be it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/nov/08/his-dark-materials-series-two-review-ruth-wilson-brandishes-tvs-scariest-tweezers">Continue reading...</a>

And these days have been more harrowing than they should have been. As we all know, Joe Biden won the Democratic primaries based on the claim that he was the safest bet to beat Donald Trump. But even if the Democratic party base was much more politically aligned with Bernie Sanders, or Elizabeth Warren, in their support for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, for racial justice, the party was sure that Bernie Sanders was too risky. And so, as we all remember, they banded together and gave us Biden.</p><p>But I think that after days of gnawing our fingers down to the quick, it’s fair to say that Biden was not safe at all, as we always knew. Not safe for the planet, not safe for the people on the front lines of police violence, not safe for the millions upon millions of people who are seeking asylum, but also not even safe as a candidate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/08/joe-biden-risky-candidate-us-election">Continue reading...</a>

At midday on Wednesday 21 January, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden">Joe Biden</a> will stand on the west front of the United States Capitol, place his left hand on a Bible, raise his right and utter 35 words: “I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the United States.”</p><p>With that oath of office Biden will become the 46th president and power will drain from his predecessor, who will become a common citizen, an ex-president, number 45, no longer commander-in-chief, head of state or Oval Office occupier. The moment will thrum with pomp and pageantry. There will be drums, a bugle, the Hail to the Chief anthem and a 21-gun salute. A polished choreography, originating from George Washington’s inauguration in 1789, to symbolise the continuity of democratic rule and the peaceful transition of power.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/can-joe-biden-and-kamala-harris-put-bitterly-divided-america-back-together">Continue reading...</a>

Its 10 songs – all warped and distorted beats, alternately jarring discordance and woozy trip-hop – rattle past in just 23 minutes, their clipped, fat-free structures owing more to early Wire than any more obvious electronica peers, with no idea lasting long enough to outstay its welcome. Against this ever-shifting backdrop, Holt, an NHS nurse, holds centre stage, her unambiguous lyrics addressing racial identity (Who Am I) and police brutality (Pray for Timeless – musically, imagine a more austere take on Anohni’s 4 Degrees). It’s telling, however, that the outstanding moment comes with the irresistible momentum of No Use, wherein lie the most conventional pop dynamics of anything here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/08/iklan-album-number-1-review-law-holt">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our heating isn’t working, so my spouse has been making an ideological case against it. All I want is one simple thing: not to be too cold</p><p>Mr Z was floating a theory yesterday about public schools and public service. Sure, he said, the whole edifice is rotten, a class of people selected by birth for the nation’s highest offices, yada yada. But to get into the weeds of it, at least in the olden days they were bred to be tough. The experience of being at a public boarding school was to be always cold and always hungry; even if this brutalised your character, at least you ended up with a bit of backbone. It was understood that, quite aside from the offices of state, they were first and foremost being educated to fight in wars, which are notoriously uncomfortable.</p><p>Contrast this with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/jul/25/two-thirds-of-boris-johnsons-cabinet-went-to-private-schools">the current generation of those born to rule</a>, who went to school in the 70s and 80s with central heating and food. Boris Johnson, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/19/eton-david-cameron-memoirs-leaders-power">David Cameron</a> et al have all the noxious entitlement, but none of the self-abnegation. That’s why their judgment is so poor and their empathy so limited. People who have always been warm enough have never had to consider the consequences of hardship or, indeed, anything. This is how great dynasties have fallen throughout history: at the start, the overlords are hard as nails; it is when they become pampered that their privilege turns to fecklessness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/nov/08/my-partner-and-i-are-in-a-gender-war-how-high-should-you-put-the-central-heating">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former prosecutor and senator is the first woman to fill her upcoming White House role. What does her life so far tell us about how she will govern?<br /></p><p>Kamala Harris has spent her life crashing through glass ceilings and accumulating “firsts”. She was the first female district attorney of San Francisco, the first female attorney general of California, the first Indian American in the US Senate, the first Indian American candidate of a major party to run for vice-president. Soon she will become the first female vice-president. If Joe Biden only serves one term, as expected, there is a chance that in 2024 she could become the first black female president.</p><p>The problem with phrases like “first black female president” is that they confine the California senator to the sort of boxes she has always tried to avoid. “When I first ran for office that was one of the things that I struggled with, which is that you are forced through that process to define yourself in a way that you fit neatly into the compartment that other people have created,” she told the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/i-am-who-i-am-kamala-harris-daughter-of-indian-and-jamaican-immigrants-defines-herself-simply-as-american/2019/02/02/0b278536-24b7-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html">Washington Post</a> last year. “I am who I am … You might need to figure it out, but I’m fine with it.” She does not agonise over her identity – she simply calls herself a “proud American”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/08/the-meaning-of-kamala-harris-the-woman-who-will-break-new-ground-as-vice-president">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Republic)<br />The pop titan’s sex-fixated sixth album belies its introspective soft centre</p><p>Whether she’s singing about her exes or world-shaking tragedy, or both, <a href="https://www.arianagrande.com/">Ariana Grande</a> has always been an open-book superstar. But few expected the balladeering Barbarella to release a sixth album so explicitly about bonking. Clearly she’s been having a more eventful pandemic than most, though the warped MGM strings on <em>Positions</em> suggest that Grande, a lifelong Judy Garland fan, is blurring Pornhub and eroto-pop fantasy.</p><p>With her pleasure-seeking hubris leaving little to the imagination (well-fitting vaginas! cunnilingus!), perhaps it’s unsurprising that the production plays it fairly safe: Grande falls comfortably back on 90s-indebted, trap-speckled R&amp;B, her voice breathy and gleaming.

<p>Would you harm yourself just to get at someone else? Spite is in us all, but there are unexpected benefits to it</p><p>On a memorable episode of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/20/curb-your-enthusiasm-metoo-larry-david" title="">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a></em>, the curmudgeonly protagonist Larry David is angered by the lukewarm lattes at his local café so he opens a “spite” café. It is an identical coffee shop and right next door, but everything is cheaper. He runs it at a personal financial loss, but is driven by the thought of putting his neighbour out of business. It is magnificently mean-spirited, petty, spiteful – and humorous.</p><p>A murkier question is can spite be good? It seems counterintuitive to put an optimistic spin on behaviour that, by definition, involves hurting others while incurring harm to yourself. But a new book by Simon McCarthy-Jones explores its benefits. “Spite came from the darkness… It seeks to harm the other and to bring about changes in dominance. Yet it can help us into the light,” writes McCarthy-Jones, an associate professor in clinical psychology and neuropsychology at Trinity College in Dublin. “Spite is a sword of Damocles dangling over our interactions. It has made society fairer and more co-operative.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/08/is-it-ever-good-to-be-spiteful">Continue reading...</a>

It would be a good time for a few games of chess, except that Heller isn’t interested in chess. “I feel like I should pretend that I am. My kid has started learning how to play and was taking classes before the quarantine began. But yeah, my five-year-old knows more about chess than me,” she says.</p><p>This is an endearingly unguarded declaration from a woman who has returned to acting, after the best part of a decade behind the camera, for a Netflix series that is all about the rise of a chess prodigy.

<p>War is the domain of tragedy and chance, not of reassuring patriotic stories – as my Red Army grandfather well understood</p><p>I remember, as a 17-year-old taking an A-level in history, coming home from school and one of my mums asking what I had learned that day. She knew we were studying the Soviet Union, and it was a subject she felt close to: her parents were Polish-Jewish refugees who’d found safety in the USSR after fleeing east in 1939. Her father was in the Red Army from 1939 to the end of the war. When I replied that I’d learned how many people Stalin had killed, estimated at 6 million or more, my mum bristled: “Is that really all they teach you?”</p><p>At the time, my mum’s prickly response surprised me. Stalin’s death toll seemed too big to carry any caveats. The sheer enormity of the number – which included many Jews – eclipsed any curiosity for marginal histories or rival experiences, however close to home. But our exchange stayed with me, and over time crystallised into a lesson that every history syllabus struggles to convey: sweeping narratives of heroes and villains, victors and vanquished, good democracies and evil dictatorships, cannot capture the contradictions of how life is lived on the ground.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/08/remembrance-day-amnesia-patriotic-stories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fed up with modern finance and Britain’s broken banking system, Anne Boden decided there was only one thing to do: set up a bank that ran in the way she wanted it to</p><p>The first time I met Anne Boden was last December at a glitzy awards ceremony where I knew no one, felt out of place and was skulking in the loos. In she bustled – she’s smaller than me (I’m 5ft 1in), older than me (she’s 60), a little eccentric and perhaps the friendliest person in the place. She didn’t stop talking. She ushered me out, remained by my side until the ceremony started (think Disney’s Fairy Godmother) and, along the way, mentioned that she was the founder and CEO of <a href="https://www.starlingbank.com/" title="">Starling Bank</a>, the event’s main sponsor.</p><p>I couldn’t have been more surprised – or picture a less likely “banking mogul”. When she explained that Starling was an app-based bank, I rewarded her with the worst response possible. “You mean like Monzo?” (My daughter had signed up to Monzo, the trendy “no branches” bank, to acquire its distinctive coral-coloured card, which now gathers dust on her bookshelf.) Boden was gracious but flustered. I ascertained that Monzo had been founded by her former business partner <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/11/the-bank-manager-will-see-you-now-is-monzo-ready-to-grow-up" title="">Tom Blomfield</a>. He was considerably younger, more hip, more Hoxton – and he’d left her, taking the other directors with him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/nov/08/its-crazy-but-i-set-up-my-own-bank-the-story-behind-starling-anne-boden-ceo-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The key to a successful wine investment, it appears, is not to drink it</p><p>Are you happy with your relationship with wine? I’m finding mine a bit complicated. Last week, my wife and I went to a swanky restaurant for dinner. The second lockdown was coming, and it was our last chance to have food brought to us by people who weren’t driving scooters. And of course I wanted to order some wine. A bottle of wine, in fact. A 75cl bottle of red wine, to be precise.</p><p>Except of course, when it comes to wine, that isn’t being very precise. A waiter handed me a long and tightly printed list, which was vaguely reminiscent of the incomprehensible pages in the middle of my grandfather’s copy of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> on which share prices were printed. Roughly 46% of the items on this impenetrable document were 75cl bottles of red wine. I scanned the names for something familiar and saw various references to tempranillo, which rang a bell.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/08/for-me-wine-goes-down-too-easily-to-ever-go-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For years, I repressed thinking about three things that shaped my life and my body. But the fourth blow of coronavirus pushed it all out into the open</p><p>For six years now, I have been writing down three good things that have happened in my day, every day. It doesn’t matter how big or small they are. It could be having pastries in bed. Spotting a fox in the garden. Successfully descaling a kettle. I do not call this my gratitude journal, because I am not a motivational wellness blogger. But I have found it vital, in order to rewire my brain to focus on the things that have gone right. Left unattended, my thoughts have a tendency to slip into a downward spiral, to somewhere much darker.</p><p>I grew up in Italy, where there is a saying: “<em>Non c’è due senza tre</em>”, which roughly means “Good (or bad) things come in threes”. For most of my adult life, there have been three main issues that have preoccupied my thoughts when I’m lying in bed at night. I have guarded them preciously: I barely mention them, even to my closest friends. But, sometimes, repressing thoughts takes more effort than confronting them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/08/how-long-covid-forced-me-to-confront-my-past-and-my-identity">Continue reading...</a>

It has to be established to entice a big name to give a candid TV interview. It is also, of course, the basis of many a scam. Pulling off a confidence trick commonly involves first offering your “mark”, or target, something useful, in an open-handed way, to build up trust, before going in for the kill.</p><p>The BBC and its journalist Martin Bashir now both stand accused, once again, of perpetrating this kind of con on Diana, Princess of Wales and her brother, Charles Spencer, to set up Bashir’s sensational <em>Panorama</em> interview in 1995: the programme that fully exposed the discord at the heart of the most famous marriage in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/focus/2020/nov/08/princess-diana-her-brother-and-the-questions-about-the-martin-bashir-interview-that-wont-go-away">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rob Brydon’s quick-wit has charmed us all. But it wasn’t always so simple. Here, he talks about his five children, being prodded by Boris and the moment his fortunes changed…</p><p>There are two versions of the comic Rob Brydon: Television Personality and Twickenham Dad. And although the two identities have lived hugger-mugger inside him for decades, occasionally overlapping, “like tectonic plates”, says the 55-year-old, they are rarely seen out in public at the same time. I’m lucky this afternoon that I get to meet both Brydons: the performer, who is polished and smiley if a touch remote, as well as the softer, more relatable father-of-five. It’s Twickenham Dad I meet first. When I come up on Brydon on a London street he is peering through the window of a home-furnishing showroom, taking pictures of a nice bit of garden furniture that’s caught his eye.</p><p>This furniture looks to be hewn out of stone and (we both note) has no obvious price tag. “So whatever you think it costs,” says Brydon, in his measured and pleasing Port Talbot accent, “add lots of <em>zeroes</em> on.” He is wearing a fitted, felty suit and has his charcoal hair neatly parted. The enduringly youthful face, lightly scarred from teenage battles with acne, is mostly covered by a pale pandemic mask. He removes the mask once we’re seated in a nextdoor restaurant. Angling his thick-framed bifocals, Brydon studies the menu, taking an age to choose and dramatising his indecision for the waiter’s amusement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/nov/08/rob-brydon-interview-i-love-this-job-i-want-to-keep-doing-it-fatherhood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Robbie Lawrence’s poignant portrait of botanist Jim Taggart captures a man whose life was devoted to an alternative paradise</p><p>This portrait of Dr Jim Taggart, a renowned botanist and climate activist, was taken not long before he died last year, aged 84. Over 50 years, Taggart created one of Scotland’s most magical gardens on the Rosneath peninsula in Argyll and Bute. With his son, Jamie, Taggart had collected around 4,000 plant species from across the world, including rare magnolias and acers, 40 kinds of bamboo, and 300 different rhododendrons. Right up until his death, visitors were welcomed to the three rocky acres of Linn Botanic Gardens with soup and sandwiches, and given a philosophical guided tour of the rarities that thrived in its curious subtropical microclimate.</p><p>Among those visitors to Linn in 2016 was photographer Robbie Lawrence, who returned to capture the garden in all of its misty seasons, and struck up a friendship with Taggart. A book of Lawrence’s photographs, <em><a href="https://www.stanleybarker.co.uk/products/a-voice-above-the-lynn">A Voice Above the Linn</a></em>, is published this month, with poems by John Burnside. The book stands as a celebration of a singular life. Above the Italianate villa at the centre of his private jungle, Taggart had hoisted the red flag. He was a stalwart of anti-nuclear protests at the Trident base at nearby Faslane on the far bank of Gare Loch.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/nov/08/the-big-picture-gardener-of-eden">Continue reading...</a>
