Although African American women have influenced rock and roll, their presence in the genre has been diminished in favor of narratives of rock being dominated by White men. Journalist, cofounder and driving force behind NPR Music's Turning The Tables series Ann Powers will interview Maureen Mahon, author of Black Diamond Queens, to discuss how African American women have laid the foundation for rock and roll\u2014from chart-topping hits and stage personas. The interview will also highlight recordings, albums, photographs, and other archival materials within the museum\u2019s collections that document African American women\u2019s history in rock and roll between the 1950s to the present. \n\nThis program is produced in partnership with The National Museum of African American History and Culture, and part of the Smithsonian American Women\u2019s History Initiative - #BecauseOfHerStory\n\nBlack Diamond Queens can be purchased at the Duke University Press website.

Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAbby O'Neill | November 6, 2020\nAscending R&B talent Tiana Major9 welcomes us into her South London home with a band she assembled for her Tiny Desk (home) concert. Tiana gained the music world\u2019s attention in August when Adele took to Instagram to call the song \u201cSame Space?\u201d \u201cabsolutely stunning!!\u201d (The post was liked more than 430,000 times.) I was lucky enough to witness a private Tiana showcase in Los Angeles several months earlier, where I was moved by the refined nature of her voice.\n\nShe begins her Tiny Desk with an ending of sorts: the devastating \u201cCollide,\u201d written for the final sequence of Lena Waithe\u2019s critically acclaimed film Queen & Slim. Later, she shows off her range and timbre on \u201cThink About You,\u201d a stunning love song that infuses elements of jazz, alternative R&B and her Jamaican roots. The sweetness in its refrain \u201cI need more hours in the day \u2026 just to think about you\u201d feels like a blueprint for how to spend the third wave of quarantine. \n\nSET LIST\n\"Collide\"\n\"...Exclusively\"\n\"Think About You\"\n\"Lucky\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nTiana Major9: vocals\nDaniella Bernard: keys\nGaetan Judd: guitar\nBenjamin Bekantoy: bass\n\nCREDITS\nVideo By: Lauren Ambersley\nAudio By: PRGRSHN\n\nTINY DESK TEAM\nProducer: Abby O'Neill\nVideo Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith\nAudio Mastering: Josh Rogosin\nAssociate Producer: Bobby Carter\nTiny Production Team: Bob Boilen, Kara Frame, Maia Stern\nExecutive Producer: Lauren Onkey\nSenior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzYBAe-Af-Y", "date_published": "2020-11-06 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
