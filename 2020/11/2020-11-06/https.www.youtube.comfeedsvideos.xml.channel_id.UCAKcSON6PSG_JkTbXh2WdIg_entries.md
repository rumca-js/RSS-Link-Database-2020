Since April, the National Independent Venue Association (NIVA) has represented America's independent music and entertainment venues in their struggle to survive amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Rev. Moose, NIVA's executive director, told The Current's Jay Gabler where things stand - and what's being lost as venues start to permanently close.

November 5 is the birthdate of the great soul singer Charles Bradley. Nicknamed the "Screaming Eagle of Soul," Bradley visited our studio a handful of times, and each time was as special and memorable as the last. An extraordinary person, Bradley's career began in earnest at the age of 62, when he released his debut album on Daptone Records in 2011, proving it's never too late for musical talent to emerge. Prior to that, Bradley had worked as a James Brown impersonator, and in the years before that, he had worked in various jobs around the country. Sadly, Bradley passed away in 2017 at the age of 68, but his voice and his performances are immortal. Enjoy these marvelous songs by Charles Bradley, recorded live in our studio in 2013 and 2016.
