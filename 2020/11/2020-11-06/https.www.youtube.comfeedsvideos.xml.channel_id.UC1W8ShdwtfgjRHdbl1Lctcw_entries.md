I colorized, restored and created a sound design for this video of San Francisco 1930s, The trip begins at the Embarcadero clock tower and merely runs straight up Market Street. Notably, the old Examiner building and marquee pop up at the 3:14 mark, and the video switches to some manner of parade at the end.

Video Restoration Process:
✔ FPS boosted to 60 frames per second 
✔ Image resolution boosted up to HD 
✔ Improved video sharpness and brightness
✔ Colorized only for the ambiance
✔added sound only for the ambiance
✔restoration:(stabilisation,denoise,deblur) 

Please, be aware that colorization colors are not real and fake, colorization was made only for the ambiance and do not represent real historical data.
