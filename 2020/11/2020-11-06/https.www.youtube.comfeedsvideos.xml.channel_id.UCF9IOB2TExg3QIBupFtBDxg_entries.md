Update on the Danish mutation and a flattening of cases in the UK
Denmark

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54851042

Has locked down some areas

Self-isolation for return announced on Friday

UK has imposed an immediate ban

UK nationals or residents can return, to isolate, with all members of their household for 14 days

Announced at 02.00 Saturday

Applies from 04.00 Saturday

World Health Organization, it is too early to jump to conclusions

1) The northwestern part of Denmark where the infected mink are, is under lockdown and people cannot enter/leave the region

2) There are no cases of the mutation in the eastern part of Denmark where Copenhagen is located.

3) Denmark has decided to be much more responsible in reporting this mutation widely and early in order to avoid the situation in China where alarms were not sounded appropriately.

Cases, + 60,486

Deaths, + 828 deaths

One week into a second lockdown

Curfew, 22:00 to 06:00

Hospitalisations, + 553

(lowest in 3 weeks)

Health Minister Olivier Véran

Stick to the lockdown rules

Intensive care units would be overwhelmed, middle of November without the restrictions

The more rigorous we are, the shorter the lockdown will be

The situation is very serious - the second wave is here and it is violent

Denmark
5.8 million people
17 million mink

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54818615

Cull all mink, 207 farms effected, 1,000 farms overall

Mutated form of coronavirus

Transmissible to humans, 12 transfers so far 

Virus may therefore already be in the local human population

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen

Mutated virus posed a risk to the effectiveness of future vaccine

Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, US

UK response

Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, announces travellers arriving after 4am on Friday must self-isolate for 14 days

https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/05/danish-covid-19-mink-variant-could-spark-new-pandemic-scientists-warn

Prof Kåre Mølbak, vaccine expert and director of infectious diseases

State Serum Institute

The worst-case scenario is that we would start off a new pandemic in Denmark 

There’s a risk that this mutated virus is so different from the others that we’d have to put new things in a vaccine

and therefore [the mutation] would slam us all in the whole world back to the start

Dutch virologist and zoonosis expert, Wim van der Poel

more research needed

It seems the mink-variant mutation is found in the spike protein of the Sars-Cov-2 virus

but we don’t really know 

Weasels, badgers, otters, ferrets, martens and wolverines

Prof Ian Jones, virologist at the University of Reading

The idea that the virus mutates in a new species is not surprising …

as it must adapt to be able to use mink receptors to enter cells and so will modify the spike protein to enable this to happen efficiently

The danger is that the mutated virus could then spread back into man

and evade any vaccine response which would have been designed to the original, non-mutated version of the spike protein
