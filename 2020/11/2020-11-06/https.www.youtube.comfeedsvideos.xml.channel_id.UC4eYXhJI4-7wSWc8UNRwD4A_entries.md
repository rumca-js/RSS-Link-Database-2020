In partnership with The National Museum of African American History and Culture, join NPR Music for an engaging conversation highlighting African American women who have played a pivotal part in the rock and roll genre. Although African American women have influenced rock and roll, their presence in the genre has been diminished in favor of narratives of rock being dominated by White men. Journalist, cofounder and driving force behind NPR Music's Turning The Tables series Ann Powers will interview Maureen Mahon, author of Black Diamond Queens, to discuss how African American women have laid the foundation for rock and roll—from chart-topping hits and stage personas. The interview will also highlight recordings, albums, photographs, and other archival materials within the museum’s collections that document African American women’s history in rock and roll between the 1950s to the present. 

This program is produced in partnership with The National Museum of African American History and Culture, and part of the Smithsonian American Women’s History Initiative - #BecauseOfHerStory

The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | November 6, 2020
Ascending R&B talent Tiana Major9 welcomes us into her South London home with a band she assembled for her Tiny Desk (home) concert. Tiana gained the music world’s attention in August when Adele took to Instagram to call the song “Same Space?” “absolutely stunning!!” (The post was liked more than 430,000 times.) I was lucky enough to witness a private Tiana showcase in Los Angeles several months earlier, where I was moved by the refined nature of her voice.

She begins her Tiny Desk with an ending of sorts: the devastating “Collide,” written for the final sequence of Lena Waithe’s critically acclaimed film Queen & Slim. Later, she shows off her range and timbre on “Think About You,” a stunning love song that infuses elements of jazz, alternative R&B and her Jamaican roots. The sweetness in its refrain “I need more hours in the day … just to think about you” feels like a blueprint for how to spend the third wave of quarantine.
