a stimulus package once the election is done and dusted.</strong></p><p>However, it probably won\u2019t match the $3trn deal that <a

year</a>.</p><p>Biden\u2019s legislative agenda will be at the mercy of either the majority Republican Senate or their blocking filibuster tactic if they fail to win the majority. Other more moderate Democrats could also spoil the party. Hence, it is much less likely that Biden will be able to pursue his more progressive \u201cgreen\u201d infrastructure stimulus deal. It will also be much more difficult to pass many of his other favourite initiatives, including the proposed tax increases, changes to healthcare and increased regulation. Biden would need to try to negotiate with the Republicans via the budget reconciliation process and using his executive powers. Alternatively, he might need to move to outlaw the filibuster tactic, although this would probably be met with resistance and traditional Democrats in the Senate appear reluctant to change the rules.<br /></p><p>Despite the uncertainty, I believe there is a good chance that a new fiscal package will be agreed before Inauguration Day next January, although the size of any deal is likely to be considerably smaller than the Democrats would like. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/nov/06/election-tensions-markets-japan-nikkei-ftse-dow-us-jobs-non-farm-business-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/nov/06/election-tensions-markets-japan-nikkei-ftse-dow-us-jobs-non-farm-business-live", "date_published": "2020-11-06 13:13:54+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'Care work is hugely uplifting': meet the driving instructor who did a career U-turn", "description": "<p>When 32-year-old Camilla realised clients were cancelling their driving lessons because of Covid-19, she decided to take a leap of faith and try something new ...</p><p>Having painstakingly built up her business as a driving instructor over the past four years, the decision to shift careers during lockdown was not an easy one for Camilla, 32, from Worcester.

The announcement of a follow-up starring Parker\u2019s understudy Miles Morales caused great excitement in June, but that soured a little when developer Insomniac clarified that it would be a spin-off rather then a sequel \u2013 a shorter, alternative take on the original, but at full price.

But although Miles Morales is definitely more condensed than its predecessor, it is hugely enjoyable and even moving in its own right.</p><p>Peter Parker is off on holiday for a few weeks, leaving young Miles to protect New York as a sort of substitute-teacher Spider-Man.

If you want to remain aware, the best way to measure cortisol, the primary stress hormone, is by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/03/scientists-hail-earwax-test-for-checking-stress-hormone-levels\">analysing your earwax</a>, according to a study from University College London\u2019s Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience. Alternatively, you could count the unbelievably stupid things you have done over the week.</p><p>Stress is usually considered an internal state \u2013 something amiss in your mind that the outside world can perceive only by a slight squeak to your voice. (You might also get a stress headache, but only in an advert.) Really, though, it is where the internal meets the external that the problems start. Distraction, absent-mindedness: none of this would matter if you hadn\u2019t also put your phone in the fridge and your wallet in the bin and set loose a cascade of errors to which catastrophic lateness for everything is the background music.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/06/how-should-you-deal-with-stress-in-2020-first-ditch-the-meditation\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/nov/06/how-should-you-deal-with-stress-in-2020-first-ditch-the-meditation", "date_published": "2020-11-06 09:42:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Myanmar minorities, including Rohingya, excluded from voting in election", "description": "<p>Rights groups say poll, which Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s NLD is expected to win, is \u2018fundamentally flawed\u2019 </p><p>Myanmar is preparing to go to the polls for the country\u2019s second general election since the end of full military rule, a vote that is expected to return Aung San Suu Kyi to power, but will exclude about 2.6 million ethnic-minority voters.</p><p>While Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy rose to victory on a wave of optimism in 2015, this year\u2019s elections are overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis and intense conflict in parts of the country \u2013 where the military has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/myanmar-army-accused-new-atrocities-attack-rakhine-buddhist-village-rohingya\">accused of atrocities</a> reminiscent of those inflicted on Rohingya in 2017.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/06/myanmar-minorities-rohingya-excluded-voting-election-poll-aung-san-suu-kyi-rights\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/06/myanmar-minorities-rohingya-excluded-voting-election-poll-aung-san-suu-kyi-rights", "date_published": "2020-11-06 09:41:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Manchester bomber's parents among six sought for questioning", "description": "<p>Police want to question Salman Abedi\u2019s mother and father in connection with 2017 attack</p><p>The parents of the suicide bomber Salman Abedi are among six people detectives want to question over the Manchester Arena bombing, a legal ruling has revealed.</p><p>Abedi\u2019s father, Ramadan Abedi, and mother, Samia Tabbal, are among four suspects, while police want to trace and eliminate two other people from their investigation.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/06/manchester-bombers-parents-among-six-sought-for-questioning\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/nov/06/manchester-bombers-parents-among-six-sought-for-questioning", "date_published": "2020-11-06 09:33:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "UK students: how are you affected by the lockdown in England?", "description": "<p>We\u2019d like to hear how your situation has changed due to the national lockdown </p><p> As coronavirus cases continue to rise, we would like to hear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/nov/05/security-fence-manchester-university-student-flats\">how students are coping</a> with the national lockdown in England, and what difference it has made to their experience at university.</p><p>We\u2019d like to hear how students are coping.

It is rich with hidden archaeology and characterful ancient trees, all in the most atmospheric setting \u2013 on the Solway coast. The wood is a nature reserve and seems more feral every time I visit, but it has a long history of management. Exploring here will reveal medieval bank systems enclosing the castles built 800 years ago, while an even larger enclosure was added around 400 years ago, and there are banks studded with old coppiced oaks and the occasional pollard.
