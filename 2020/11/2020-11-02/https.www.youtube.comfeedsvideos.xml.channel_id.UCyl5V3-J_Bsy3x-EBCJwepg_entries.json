Chesterton the avowed Catholic was dear friends with staunch atheist George Bernard Shaw. And don\u2019t forget the inspiring story of Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un. Among the greatest friends across enemy lines was Antonin Scalia and RBG. They were the best of friends, though they disagreed on politics. \n\nIn this emotional, moving ballad, The Babylon Bee makes a tribute to the American value of civility and friendship despite intense disagreement. \n\nShare this video and be someone's Scalia, and maybe they'll be your RBG.\n\nLyrics: \nJust a couple wings, mine\u2019s on the right\nYours is on the left so I guess we\u2019re supposed to fight\nBut isn\u2019t there more than politics to this life?\ncan I take your hand in friendship across this great divide?\n\nI\u2019ll be Rocky, you be Apollo Creed\nYou Be the Colms to my Hannity\nI\u2019ll be\u00a0 Chesterton, and you be Shaw\nYou be dennis Rodman, I\u2019ll be your Kimmy Jong\n\nI\u2019ll be Dubya, You be Ellen D\nYou be Hitchens, I\u2019ll be your brother Pete\nI\u2019ll be the Dems, you be 2McCain\nYou be Daryl Davis, I\u2019ll be your KKK\n\nWoody and Buzz found love though they were enemies\nI\u2019ll be your Antonin Scalia, you be my RBG\n\nMike Tyson\u00a0 went and bit Evander Holyfield\u2019s ear off\nBut nowadays he doesn\u2019t mind him\nWhen Big Bird got kidnapped by a couple of scheming carnies\nOscarthe grouch\u00a0drove his\u00a0sloppy jalopy to\u00a0try and find him\nYou know the Rock often mocked Steve Austin but they\u2019re just actors\noff the mat they had each others backs- just like two chiropractors\n\nJoe Rogan loves everyone\nmaybe it\u2019s the DMT\nAnd you may have heard that Larry Bird\nAnd\u00a0 Magic Johnson are friendly\nAnd maybe one day Elena Kegan will be down with ACB\nEvery Antonin Scalia needs an RBG\n\n(Together we can dream)\nWe can protest peacefully \n(This ain\u2019t the UFC)\nLike Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee, WWJD? \n(Let\u2019s get some KFC)\nYou can torch cop cars, I\u2019ll read Thomas Sowell \nWe\u2019re not all bad (I\u2019m like the BFG)\nI\u2019ll be your Antonio Scalia\nBe my RBG", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcXLA0cwjNg", "date_published": "2020-11-02 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
