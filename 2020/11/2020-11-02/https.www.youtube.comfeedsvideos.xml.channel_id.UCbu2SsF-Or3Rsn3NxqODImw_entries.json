We were able to test out Horizon\u2019s tactical ability on the latest map, checking out how the new legend interacts with the abilities of the other Apex Legends characters.\n\nGameSpot's Max Blumenthal and Erick Tay play around with Horizon\u2019s Gravity Lift, a plantable rift that launches squad members--and, surprisingly, items--high into the sky.\n\nPlayers can even toss the abilities of other legends into Horizon\u2019s Gravity Lift. Mirage\u2019s holographic decoy Psyche Out can get a lift if sent through the ability. And most legends that have a throwable, like Bloodhound and Lifeline, will see their abilities blast off if thrown directly into Gravity Lift as well.\n\nNot all abilities interact with Gravity Lift, though. This is the case with Wraith\u2019s Into the Void tactical ability. When activated, Wraith simply sprints through Gravity Lift--which makes sense since she enters a different dimension. The same happens with Pathfinder\u2019s Grappling Hook tactical ability.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8VTDMow9aC8", "date_published": "2020-11-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Call Of Duty's Top 10 Broken Guns Of All Time", "description": "Call of Duty has a long history of imbalanced, infamous guns that tarnish the multiplayer experience. Let's take a look at some of the series shining examples.\n\nCall of Duty has a history of broken guns throughout the years. Guns that are way too powerful that require patches to fix, or guns that are so weak and flawed that we wonder why it was added into the game at all. While we look back on some of them with rose-tinted glasses, others we wish we could forget. As time goes on, developers are quick to hear the Call Of Duty community\u2019s outcry for guns that need fixing, but this wasn\u2019t always the case, especially in the series\u2019 heyday. Here\u2019s our list of the most broken guns from Call Of Duty 4 to 2019s Modern Warfare.\n\nThe HS-10 shotgun from Black Ops 1 seems like a fun addition to the gun roster, but aside from its flashy looks, the HS-10 was barely functional. The range was low, the ammo count was weak, and dual-wielding them did nothing to help. Next up is the Grau 5.56 from 2019\u2019s Modern Warfare. For a while, this gun was the king of Warzone. It was steady, deadly, and could pick people off from several meters away. Reminiscent of the ARC from MW2, the Grau was eventually patched in numerous ways. That being said, it\u2019s still a very popular choice for Warzone players. Going back to MW2, the UMP45 is a nasty submachine gun from a time where patches happened less often. Easily the most popular submachine gun, the UMP has a quick time to kill and can be enjoyed akimbo! Normally that means less control with your aim, but it works surprisingly well...too well\u2026 Modern Warfare was also responsible for the snake shot .357. This deadly sidearm became a primary thanks to its kill range, and high damage snake shot ammunition. Like the Grau 5.56, it was nerfed, but not forgotten. After the awesome weapons offered in MW2, Black Ops felt lackluster in comparison.\n\nNext, we jump into the future! Advanced Warfare\u2019s BAL 27 was a quick fan favorite at launch. Once word got out about its outlandish fire rate and time to kill, the BAL was patched within a month. Even with its quirk of increased fire rate over time, the patch\u2019s damage had been done. Next is the Dragunov. No matter what Call Of Duty game you\u2019re playing the Dragunov does you no favors. It has high recoil and low damage: A deadly mix that no player enjoys. You\u2019ll lose gunfight after gunfight using this ancient weapon with no benefits. A prime example being the HK-10 light machine gun. This underwhelming gun has bumpy recoil, low ammo count and few attachments to make it better. Trust us when we say, any other LMG would work better. Next is the FMG9 from Modern Warfare 3. This rapid-fire machine pistol will melt enemies at short range. Even at a distance, the FMG9 has the potential to win fights against submachine guns and even some shotguns. Another classic broken gun is the Desert Eagle from Call Of Duty 4. With its low recoil and high damage, this was a popular choice as a primary weapon. We also can\u2019t forget that iconic sound. Last but not least is the infamous and iconic Model 1887 from MW2. Straight from the golden era of COD, the model 1887 was an overpowered mess with way too much range. Using it akimbo was destructive and memorable. When you think of broken, overpowered guns in Call Of Duty, you\u2019re probably picturing these bad boys.\n\nIntro: 00:00\n10) Desert Eagle: 00:13\n9) Snake Shot .357: 01:14\n8) BAL-27: 02:13\n7) Dragunov: 02:54\n6) HK-10: 03:42\n5) HS10: 04:46\n4) Grau 5.56: 05:31\n3) UMP45: 06:27\n2) FMG9: 07:20\n1) Model 1887: 08:21", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=px7rjCwcJYg", "date_published": "2020-11-03 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity Crazy Combos", "description": "With the Zelda game Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity arriving on November 20 for Nintendo Switch, we recently had the opportunity to go hands-on with the title ahead of release, and we made the most of it.
