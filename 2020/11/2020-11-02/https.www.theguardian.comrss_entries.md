<p><strong>Royal Lyceum, Edinburgh/online<br /></strong>The comedian – on a solo tour of UK theatres – finds warm and funny layers of humanity in the small details of everyday lives</p><p>Daniel Kitson doesn’t strike you as an everyman. With his unkempt beard, his pyrotechnic turn of phrase and his insistence on doing things his own way (this solo tour among them), he is more of a great British eccentric than a man with the common touch. Telling a story about choking while cycling, he describes himself as “Typhoid Mary with a beard and a backpack”. Even he thinks it reasonable for the kids in his London street to choose him as the victim in a game of truth or dare.</p><p>With characteristic lateral thinking, the comedian-turned-storyteller is touring Dot. Dot. Dot. to theatres around the UK, the novelty being he’s the only one in the house. “I’m not going to be using any of this,” he gestures at the empty velvet-and-gold Lyceum auditorium on his opening night, as he sits down at a table on the bare stage. The rest of us, limited to the audience capacity of each venue, watch from our screens.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/nov/02/dot-dot-dot-review-daniel-kitson-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Gary Chilton, whose father, Chris, scored a record 222 goals for Hull City, accuses the PFA of treating former players with dementia ‘like the elephant in the room’</p><p>Ten days ago the Chilton family were at breaking point. Chris Chilton, 77, was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia in 2012. Eight years later he needs a level of care his family cannot afford.</p><p>They did not know where to turn, or what to do. They felt utterly alone. This even though he was one of the best forwards in England in the 1960s. He scored a record 222 goals for Hull City, where he formed a famous strike partnership with Ken Wagstaff. The Professional Footballers’ Association (PFA) paid for Chilton to spend four weeks in a care home and the family had pulled together enough from their savings to pay for a fortnight more. But that was about to run out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/nov/02/dementia-football-rife-game-not-doing-enough-to-help-chris-chilton-gary-chilton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A sense of despair and outrage among young people over global heating is being met with indifference and dismissal among some older relatives</p><p>The climate crisis lingers in the back of Gemma Gutierrez’s mind, a gnawing anxiety that blossoms fully when she reads about wildfires, flooding or other climate-related disasters. It’s a nagging concern that clouds how the 16-year-old sees her future.</p><p>“I have a sense of dread,” says Gutierrez, who lives with her parents in Milwaukee. “I dread that in my lifetime the clean water I have now or the parks I’m lucky enough to be able to go to won’t be there any more.

## Even if Donald Trump loses the election, the US isn't going to heal any time soon | Richard Sennett

<p>The anger that drives the president’s supporters was visible 50 years ago.

Those Maga caps, Trump-branded jackets and gun-butt decals are precious symbols for an estimated 30% of Americans. The “real” America belongs to them; if the election turns out wrong, the base will go to extremes to get it back. In a country of more than 300 million, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/11/10/13587462/trump-election-2016-voter-turnout">30% of people</a> is a lot of extremists. </p><p>Trump’s base is in part trying to work out how to use its whiteness as a political tool, conveying purity and nostalgic wholesomeness as well as skin colour. Excluding outsiders – as when Trump called Mexican migrants “rapists” and “criminal cheats” – and segregating people of colour inside the country are justified for the same reason; both groups are regarded as “impure bodies”. But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/13/black-americans-fear-racism-trump-has-let-out-of-the-bag">racism</a> alone can’t explain the sneering aggression, the viciousness of the base towards other Americans.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/02/donald-trump-us-election-base-extreme">Continue reading...</a>

But for this year’s winner Shaheeda Sinckler – AKA Nova – it’s about more than money: the prize is a vindication of her total self-sufficiency.</p><p>The rapper is virtually unknown – she had only around 300 monthly listeners on Spotify prior to her win – but her coolly confident, lyrically deft debut album Re-Up is a deserving winner, spanning grime, trap, Afrobeats, dubstep and frosty electronica in collaboration with some of Scotland’s fastest-rising producers. It beat far more prominent nominees, including Lewis Capaldi and Anna Meredith, by capturing the spirit of the nation’s underground nightlife, but most importantly it cements Sinckler’s own identity as an artist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/nov/02/nova-shaheeda-sinckler-scottish-album-of-the-year-award-re-up">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Edward Morris, 56, met Anja, 57, at Victoria station in London in 1985. They are married with two children and live in Bavaria</p><p>In October 1985, Edward Morris was invited to spend a year as an academic guest at ETH Zurich, a research university in Switzerland. “I’d just finished my degree in physics when I went on the exchange programme,” he says. He planned to take the ferry to mainland Europe from Dover. “First, I had to take the train from London to the coast and I arrived at Victoria station with lots of luggage.” Edward realised there was a mistake on his ticket and he needed to speak to a supervisor. He spotted Anja Langenstein standing at the station and asked if she would watch his bags. “She looked lovely and was very tall so she stood out.”</p><p>When they arrived at Dover, he saw her again, struggling with her own ticket. Edward went over to help and they struck up a conversation. “I asked whether he would sit with me on the boat,” she says. “I’m from Germany and we have a reputation for being very direct.” Edward says he was “bowled over” by the request. “She was so pretty,” he says. It was a warm evening and the pair played cards on deck. “It was such a clear night, we could see the stars and both sides of the coast,” says Edward. They chatted continuously for four hours, with Anja describing him as “a very British gentleman”. She told him she had been in Wales visiting friends and had stopped in Shrewsbury, staying just 10 minutes from where Edward’s family lived.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/02/how-we-met-at-the-start-he-was-too-british-to-argue-i-had-to-teach-him">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Tilda Swinton-starring short addresses the isolation of our Covid era, while also revealing cinema’s ability to adapt to it</p><p>It is based on a Jean Cocteau play from 1930, but Pedro Almodóvar’s The Human Voice could well be the movie that best captures our bizarre modern times. Being Almodóvar, it does so with consummate elegance, controlled melodrama and enviable home decor, but this one-room, one-person, half-hour piece somehow expresses both our own feelings of domestic isolation and the unstable ground of cinema itself.</p><p>The set-up speaks to our lockdown neuroses: Tilda Swinton indoors, alone and increasingly distraught. She is on a phone call with her ex, though we only hear her end of the conversation as she pads about her tasteful apartment wearing AirPods and an array of haute couture outfits. There are cultural trappings galore: her DVDs (Douglas Sirk, Kill Bill), art books, Chanel bags, paintings (De Chirico, Alberto Vargas). Even the axe she buys looks designer.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/nov/02/pedro-almodovar-new-film-lockdown-the-human-voice-tilda-swinton">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A report shows black and minority ethnic people are dying at a higher rate, but has little to say on the cause <br /></p><p>Powerful people like to point out that Covid-19 does not discriminate. Indeed, the rain, too, does not discriminate against those it falls on. But one’s ability to stay dry beneath a downpour is dependent on the availability of an umbrella. Similarly, our access to security in a pandemic depends on the safety net of the state. Umbrellas can be shared or withheld. Those without one can be listened to – or ignored.</p><p>I’m a youth worker, and throughout 2020 I have mentored young people from black African and Caribbean, and south Asian origins who mostly live in population-dense social housing. More often than not, their parents worked on the frontline throughout the national lockdown – carers, bus drivers, NHS receptionists, cleaners – or have pre-existing health conditions. As part of a book I’m writing, I have also interviewed many community members, including pastors, rappers and youth club managers, who fall into these same demographic groups.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/nov/02/link-racism-covid-ignored-report-black-and-minority-ethnic-people-dying">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jota offers Liverpool a Firmino alternative, Southampton enjoy away trips and Olsen’s Everton debut ups the ante for Pickford</p><p>Anyone suggesting a member of Liverpool’s established attacking trio would find their place under threat at the start of the season would have been accused of heresy, and rightly so, but that is the position Roberto Firmino finds himself in with Diogo Jota making an immediate impact at Anfield. The Portugal international has improved the competition and the options in the final third for Jürgen Klopp, and opposition defences require even greater levels of concentration and energy against the champions in the process. Against West Ham, when Jota replaced the Brazilian and scored for the third successive game at Anfield, Klopp offered a glimpse of an alternative front three with the £41m signing on the left, Mohamed Salah moving into the middle and Sadio Mané switching to the right. “Mo and Sadio were making exceptional runs and we needed connected movements, that’s why we made the change,” explained Klopp. “It’s not nice for defenders.”<br /><strong>Andy Hunter</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/02/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To continue with European competitions at a time like this feels like an exercise in futility and jaw-dropping complacency</p><p>There is a debate to be had over who is the real villain in the movie Jaws – the shark that patrols the waters off the resort of Amity devouring the appetising and unwitting, or Larry Vaughn, the wilfully myopic mayor who refuses to close the popular local beaches despite having been alerted to the predator’s presence. Following one such discussion on an episode of an American podcast, a listener felt compelled to contact the Jaws screenwriter, Carl Gottlieb, and the 82-year-old ventured the opinion that neither the maneater nor its human enabler were entirely blameless.</p><p>“Well, clearly the shark is the primary villain since he’s the one that actually bites people,” he opined. “But the mayor is a contributing villain because by his failure to take action and his denial, he puts more people in jeopardy and more people get killed.” Gottlieb went on to explain that Mayor Vaughn wasn’t entirely deserving of opprobrium because he was at least trying to serve the greater good in the face of totally “unpredictable uproar”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/nov/02/uefa-ceferin-plays-mayor-vaughn-and-ploughs-on-champions-league-europa">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The fashion photographer and documenter of 60s London looks back in the company of old friends and lovers in a raw and surprising memoir</p><p>Spare a thought for the sleepless nights of Mr Edward Shrimpton, a self-made builder, who by 1960 had bought himself a 200-acre farm in Buckinghamshire, and sent his two daughters to the best local convent school. First, his eldest, Jean, 18, falls for a married man, an East Ender, who has been taking “glamour” pictures of her. And if that weren’t enough, his younger daughter, Chrissie, is knocking around with an art student, whose only prospect of gainful employment seems to be with a music group who are yet to release a record. Faced with the prospect of David Bailey in his hay barn and Mick Jagger in his back bedroom, it seems that Edward Shrimpton could not decide who to aim his shotgun at first.</p><p>Sixty years on, Jean Shrimpton and Bailey can still conjure the thrill of those early liaisons, in which at least one free-spirited image of the decade that followed was created. They never did an interview together in the years that they made each other famous, as far as they recall, so when they sit down here, at the heart of Bailey’s predictably candid memoir, it’s like they are piecing together little fragments of a shared fantasy: the landmark <em>Vogue</em> shoot in New York, taking studio fashion on to the street, him bringing flowers to her, and carrying them without embarrassment, their first sex, on Littleton Common (“ah yes, I remember it well”). “It took me three months to get my leg across,” Bailey recalls, to emphasise his gallantry.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/nov/02/look-again-by-david-bailey-review-girls-camera-action">Continue reading...</a>

Why? “This tree is a survivor,” he says. “Like many old American elms, it’s located in an isolated place where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/12/us-forests-pests-risk-climate-crisis-resource">Dutch elm disease</a> couldn’t get to it.”</p><p>The elm, which Kaufman estimates to be about 150 years old, stands in the middle of a field against the backdrop of the Berkshire Hills in western Massachusetts. It’s 95 miles from the nearest urban area, the small town of Egremont. Kaufman says that if you position yourself in a certain way, you can get a clear view of the tree with no evidence of human presence in the background. “It’s only when I photograph the tree that I realise how alone it really is. It’s very peaceful,” he says. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/nov/02/tree-of-the-week-an-american-elm-that-survives-in-peaceful-isolation">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Donald Trump faces a major challenge to repeat the swing states victory he achieved in 2016. The Guardian’s Chris McGreal takes a US election road trip and meets voters who explain why they are standing by the White House incumbent</p><p>For Donald Trump to win a second term this week, he needs another strong showing in the swing states that backed him in 2016. According to the polls, he is facing a huge challenge. But many of those who swung behind Trump last time are sticking with him again this year – and they aren’t necessarily the brash, loud voices featured on news clips from Trump rallies. </p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Chris McGreal </strong>has spent months criss-crossing the swing states – from the south, through Appalachia and up to the north and midwest. He tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>how in West Virginia he met <strong>Bo Copley</strong>, who lost his job in a coalmine before 2016 and credits Trump with overturning environmental regulations to reinvigorate his industry. He meets<strong> Andrea Zupancich, </strong> a part-time mayor in Minneapolis, who had twice backed Barack Obama and switched to Trump last time. She believes the Democrats have become too radical and recoils from slogans brandished by some supporters such as “defund the police”. In North Carolina, he also hears from <strong>Lisa Matthews</strong>, another person who backed Obama and then switched to Trump. She says that as a black single parent, she felt the Democrats stopped trying to lift people like her up and instead spoke about handouts. With only one day to go until polling day, McGreal looks back on his journey and despite the sense that many of the voters Trump is relying on may be drifting away, he can’t discount the possibility of another shock win for the former reality TV star. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/nov/02/us-election-2020-who-are-the-voters-sticking-with-trump-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
