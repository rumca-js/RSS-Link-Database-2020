One man’s experience

https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11535369/boris-johnson-on-fight-against-coronavirus/

Doctors prepared to announce his death

They gave me a face mask so I got litres and litres of oxygen and for a long time I had that and the little nose jobbie

It was a tough old moment, I won’t deny it

the bloody indicators kept going in the wrong direction

He realised there was no cure for Covid-19.

It was hard to believe that in just a few days my health had deteriorated to this extent. 

I remember feeling frustrated. I couldn’t understand why 

I wasn’t getting better

But the bad moment came when it was 50-50 whether they were going to have to put a tube down my windpipe

That was when it got a bit . . . they were starting to think about how to handle it presentationally
