<p>Don’t let the breaks pass by in a blur. With some savvy planning, you can turn your days off into proper adventures</p><p><strong>Maximise the Easter break … and embark on a tour of Belgium<br /></strong>Take four days off before or after the long Easter weekend and you can enjoy a leisurely 10-day break from the office. In early spring, Belgium comes into its own – cafe terraces become more appealing, gardens begin to bloom and chocolatiers create picture opportunities of colourful Easter window displays. Board P&amp;O Ferries’ Hull to Zeebrugge ferry in the evening and you’ll be relaxing in one of Bruges’ canalside cafes by the morning. The overnight crossing departs daily and takes 12 hours, so you can get a proper night’s kip en route.</p><p>With more than a week for exploring, you’ll also have time to take in delightful, olde worlde Ghent. The <a href="https://www.mskgent.be/en" rel="nofollow">Museum of Fine Arts</a> is hosting a much-anticipated exhibition dedicated to Renaissance painter Jan van Eyck from 1 February until 30 April. And it’s the perfect time to visit Hallerbos forest, 12 miles south of Brussels. Here, bluebells create a floral carpet amid towering sequoias. Before heading home, grab some Easter treats from one of the country’s celebrated chocolatiers, such as family-run <a href="http://www.sweetchocolatedreams.be/" rel="nofollow">Spegelaere</a> in Bruges.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-holiday-your-way/2020/jan/20/get-more-time-off-five-ways-to-make-the-most-of-your-bank-holidays">Continue reading...</a>

## Look back in Vanya: my encounters with Chekhov's classic over 60 years

<p>From Rome to Paris to London, Uncle Vanya delivers fresh meanings wherever and whenever it’s performed<br /></p><p>Which is Chekhov’s greatest play? It tends to be the one you’ve seen most recently. But my own personal favourite is Uncle Vanya. It may not have the symphonic richness of Three Sisters or The Cherry Orchard but it confronts personal failure unflinchingly and, because of its awareness of climate crisis, currently seems the most topical. That may explain why it is on view in two theatrical capitals. Ian Rickson’s production of Conor McPherson’s new version opens this week at London’s Harold Pinter theatre. Meanwhile, Channel-hoppers can still catch Stéphane Braunschweig’s extraordinary production – played in Russian with French and, on certain dates, English surtitles – at the Odeon, Paris.</p><p>Braunschweig, who has directed all the major Chekhov plays, is explicit about why he was drawn to Uncle Vanya: he sees the characters’ destruction of each other as a “mini ecosystem” that symbolises the wilful ruination of nature. Played against a curved wooden wall – sadly, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/19/paris-transport-set-to-return-to-normal-as-rail-union-suspends-strike">current strikes</a> deprived us of the forest that was part of the design when the show premiered in Moscow – the production leaves us in no doubt about the tangible despair of Chekhov’s people. Elisaveta Boyarskaya’s magnetic Yelena – the pivotal performance of the evening – is both destructive and herself destroyed. Her beauty hypnotises both Vanya and the climate-conscious doctor, Astrov. Yet she is chained by marriage to a gouty Professor whose very touch causes her to shiver with revulsion. This Yelena is clearly a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/20/look-back-in-vanya-how-chekhovs-classic-changes-with-the-climate-toby-jones">Continue reading...</a>

Italian film-maker and author who became a founding member of the British Free Cinema movement<p>The Italian film-maker and author Lorenza Mazzetti, who has died aged 91, declared herself to be a genius on her first day at the Slade School of Fine Art in London, and she made good on her promise. She unleashed a capacity to tell stories in film and literature that evoked a childhood trauma in Italy that she found too painful to discuss in person. Living in Britain after the second world war, she became a founding member of the British <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/mar/22/artsfeatures" title="">Free Cinema</a> movement alongside <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-lindsay-anderson-1445974.html" title="">Lindsay Anderson</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/28/guardianobituaries.filmnews" title="">Karel Reisz</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/30/tony-richardson-classics-mademoiselle" title="">Tony Richardson</a>.</p><p>Her most acclaimed movie, made in 1956 with the support of the BFI’s Experimental Film Fund, was Together, a heartbreaking depiction of urban isolation. In this largely dialogue-free film, the painter <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/incoming/obituary-michael-andrews-1593014.html" title="">Michael Andrews</a> and the sculptor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/apr/23/guardianobituaries.obituaries" title="">Eduardo Paolozzi</a> appear as two brothers, both deaf and without speech, working as dockers in the blitz-struck East End of London, who are snubbed and taunted by locals, with terrible consequences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/20/lorenza-mazzetti-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

That’s all she does. And a lasagne is one of the easiest things in the world to cook.

<p><strong>St David’s Hall, Cardiff</strong><br />Two conductors, two orchestras and two pianists recreated this historic four-hour four-premiere concert in a passionate and glorious evening of music</p><p>Beethoven’s 1808 benefit concert was one of classical music’s most remarkable evenings: it featured four premieres, including the 5th and 6th symphonies and the 4th piano concerto, and lasted four hours. Yet, in this recreation of that freezing December night in Vienna’s Theater an der Wien – six months before Napoleon invaded the city for the second time – it was not just the event’s scale that created the impact, but the sense it engendered of a genius at work. For the St David’s Hall audience, the buzz came from being part of something where history was being relived, giving substance to the Beethoven 250th celebrations. Here, it took two each of orchestras, conductors and pianists to realise what Beethoven – composer, fixer, conductor and soloist – effectively achieved alone.</p><p>Beginning with the Pastoral Symphony No 6 – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/21/arts.artsnews">Carlo Rizzi</a> conducting a storm in its thunderous 4th movement with the Welsh National Opera Orchestra – the programme’s faithfulness to the original happily didn’t extend to replicating the many inaccuracies that Beethoven grumbled about. Soprano <a href="https://jamesblackmanagement.com/artists/alwyn-mellor/">Alwyn Mellor</a> brought heft to the high tessitura of the concert aria Ah, Perfido!</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/20/beethoven-the-1808-concert-review-st-davids-hall-cardiff-carlo-rizzi-jaime-martin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The San Francisco 49ers quarterback wasn’t terrible in the NFC championship game. But the strength of his supporting case meant he had very little to do</p><p>When the 49ers kneeled for the final time on Sunday, officially launching themselves to a Super Bowl berth <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/19/raheem-mostert-runs-packers-ragged-as-49ers-reach-super-bowl">after a 37-20 annihilation of Green Bay</a>, Levi’s Stadium shook with joy. Kyle Shanahan threw down his headset and hugged every warm body in sight, the players’ families swarmed the field, and red and gold confetti rained down until there was barely a blade of visible grass left on the field. Running back Raheem Mostert celebrated his 220 yards and four touchdowns, and also the fact that he has found such an idyllic home after being cut by six other teams. The defensive backs pranced knowing they had mostly neutralized Aaron Rodgers. Then there was Jimmy Garoppolo, whose smile was as big as anyone’s despite the fact that he could have read a Dostoevsky novel for much of this game and the result would have been unchanged. Garoppolo produced virtually nothing in the NFC Championship because he didn’t have to.</p><p>“We were running the hell out of the ball tonight. It made my life very easy. It was a fun night,” said Garoppolo with his signature grin.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/20/jimmy-garoppolo-san-francisco-49ers-super-bowl-nfl">Continue reading...</a>

## Ignorance about menopause is destroying lives – and it’s not only women who suffer | Diane Danzebrink

These days it’s pretty much all I think, talk and write about, but that was never the plan. In the summer of 2012, I had to undergo a total abdominal hysterectomy, including the removal of both of my ovaries, due to suspected ovarian cancer.</p><p>Two days after surgery I was back at home, my feet up as instructed, which was perfect timing for the London Olympics. There was no discussion before or after my surgery about all the possible implications of surgical menopause, the state I now found myself in. When leaving the hospital I was simply told to see my GP at some point to discuss hormone replacement, but <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/15/hrt-hormone-replacement-therapy-wont-kill-you-but-menopausal-women-still-face-a-difficult-decision" title="">concerns</a> about it meant that I initially chose not to take it.

<p>A visit to the butcher is a reminder that meat should be a privilege, not an everyday convenience, and should be cherished in time-honoured dishes like this Roman-inspired lamb ragu with pasta</p><p>As my butcher bones out a leg of lamb and cuts the meat into pieces with a precise “thwack thwack”, or joints a chicken, we talk. About the lamb or chicken; how old it is and where it came from; the nature of the cut and the goodness of fat. We talk about what I plan to do with whatever I have bought when I get home. She is generous with advice when I ask for it, in that moment shifting roles from butcher to the sort of confident home cook who inspires trust. We also talk about being the mums of difficult eight-year-old boys, and swing between big headlines and the minutiae of every day: dry hands and cold mornings.</p><p>Manuela’s hands are worth watching: like her brother, mother and grandmother before her, she is incredibly skilled, with the strength of a lumberjack and the precision of a surgeon. The other day she cut a <em>gallina</em> (boiling fowl) in half to reveal eggs; one almost at full size in its opaque sack, the rest a bunch, like tiny grapes, only bright yellow. It was a shock, to be honest; I wanted to turn away. It was Manuela’s reaction that made me turn back, her practical admiration of the animal before her and then the way she carefully cut away the cluster of eggs and lifted them into a tub and told me to poach them in the broth I was about to make. Again, I was shocked by her suggestion; the familiar comfort of my morning shop and cooking plans disturbed by the reality of the meat I chose to eat.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/20/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-lamb-ragu-with-pasta">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>England 499 beat South Africa 209 &amp; 237 by an innings &amp; 53 runs</li><li>Lead series 2-1 before fourth and final Test in Johannesburg</li></ul><p>The victory was so easy, despite a cheerful, preposterous last wicket partnership of 99, that it becomes hard to assess. At Cape Town England had to graft, dig deep and snatch every chance to win. Here they dropped half a dozen chances, with Ben Stokes the unlikely yet most regular culprit – though he does stick himself wherever he thinks the ball will go – and still they won by an innings and 53 runs.</p><p>The mopping-up operation on a breezy day was clumsy but not too stressful, partly because the sun deigned to make an appearance again. Joe Root opened with Stuart Broad, who for the second morning in a row dismissed Vernon Philander in his first over, with Ollie Pope taking his sixth catch of the match. Root himself decided to partner Stuart Broad at the start, which made sense given his success on Sunday, though it was surprising and ultimately embarrassing that he should bowl unchanged for 80 minutes without success. His last over yielded 28 runs (including four byes); it also removed the smile from Root’s face and equalled the most expensive one delivered in Test cricket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/20/england-thrash-south-africa-third-test-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A new documentary sheds light on the career of the forgotten Frenchwoman who helped write the rules of film</p><p>Call yourself a cinephile and you’ve never heard of Alice Guy-Blaché? Don’t worry, most film-makers haven’t heard of her either. But we all should have done. In fact, there should be statues of her and cinemas named after her. At the very least, Guy-Blaché’s name belongs in chapter one of cinema history, because she was the first female film director; indeed, for a good decade she was the only female film director.</p><p>Guy-Blaché was in the room when the Lumière brothers held the first ever cinema screening, in Paris in March 1895. By the following year, she was making her own films. And while the Lumières were still hung up on cinema as a technological spectacle – “Look! A train!” – Guy-Blaché immediately saw its potential for telling stories. Even her 60-second debut, The Cabbage Fairy, had a fictional narrative (a fairy conjures babies from cardboard cabbages). As time went on, Guy-Blaché helped write the rules of this brand new medium. She incorporated now-standard techniques such as editing, primitive special effects and hand-tinted colour. She might even have invented the music video, back in 1905, with her use of newfangled “chronophone” technology, by which singers were filmed lip-syncing to a prerecorded playback.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/20/why-was-pioneering-director-alice-guy-blache-erased-from-film-making-history">Continue reading...</a>

But what if the solution lies closer to home? Bukayo Saka is 18 and earlier this season was being rightly lauded for his rich promise as a flying winger. But he has filled in at full‑back four times in the past month, most recently against Sheffield United on Saturday, and looks the part. Saka is tenacious, diligent, has speed and energy to burn and a knack of picking out teammates with his deliveries. “I think he could,” Mikel Arteta said when asked if Saka could carve out a long-term future in the role. “He is someone that’s never played there before but he’s really trying to do it as well as possible. You can see that he’s got many strengths to play in that position.” Club and manager might have hit upon something far more exciting than they expected. <strong>Nick Ames</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/20/premier-league-10-talking-points-from-the-weekends-action">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Celebrate China’s lunar new year with classic and updated dishes, including dongpo pork, stir-fried okra and braised fish with chillies</p><p>The diversity of Chinese cuisines is extraordinary but one food ritual unites Han Chinese communities all over the country and the world: the lunar New Year’s Eve dinner. (This year’s Chinese new year is on 25 January.) It’s the time when families traditionally gather for a lavish feast, prefaced by ritual offerings to gods and ancestors, and followed at midnight by a storm of firecrackers.</p><p>There are few rules for this “family reunion” (<em>tuannian</em>) meal except that there should be extraordinary amounts of food, particularly fish, meat and poultry (<em>dayu darou</em>: “great fish and great meat”). In the countryside, many households still fatten a pig as the holiday approaches, eating the prime cuts over the festivities, then making bacon, sausages or confit pork to eke out over the months ahead. The other essential is a fish, served whole and never quite finished, because the phrase “a fish every year” (<em>niannian youyu</em>) sounds the same in Chinese as “every year a surplus”. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/20/five-recipes-chinese-new-year-feast-fuchsia-dunlop">Continue reading...</a>

## How to be a good listener: my mission to learn the most important skill of all

The author Kate Murphy thinks our inability to listen properly to other people is leaving us all feeling isolated. In a world of smartphones and busy schedules, can we re-engage?<p>I was very suspicious about this assignment. Kate Murphy’s new book, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/11/youre-not-listening-kate-murphy-review" title="">You’re Not Listening</a>, suggests that many of us – absorbed in our own thoughts and dreams, occupying our little digital bubbles – have lost the ability to listen, creating an epidemic of loneliness and isolation. The thesis seems inherently plausible – but why me? Are you trying to tell me something about my inability, or perhaps unwillingness, to listen?</p><p>As my editor started telling me how I might approach this piece, I began – much to the amusement of our colleagues – interrupting her. OK, maybe I do have a little problem shutting up for a few minutes to listen; a tendency to anticipate what the other person is going to say and reply before they have even had the chance to express it the way they want to. “Bad listeners are not necessarily bad people,” Murphy says in her book, but being unable or unwilling to listen is not an attractive characteristic. It’s time for a spot of re-education. Let’s hope that after a life of lecturing rather than listening, it’s not too late.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/20/how-to-be-a-good-listener-my-mission-to-learn-the-most-important-skill-of-all">Continue reading...</a>

## Nadia Whittome, Britain’s youngest MP, on race, Rees-Mogg – and taking a massive pay cut

<p>The 23-year-old Labour member for Nottingham East still lives at home – and, despite the steep learning curve, she is determined to shake up parliament</p><p>When Nadia Whittome was growing up, her mother told her that, as a working-class girl of colour, she had to be twice as good as others to be judged half as good. Evidently, it was a lesson that the youngest MP to enter parliament at after last month’s general election took to heart. After all, not every 23-year-old’s nights out clubbing end with them trying diligently to unionise the staff. “Sometimes in the club toilets there are women selling deodorants or sweets. And I’ll go up to them and have a chat and just get to know them and ask whether they’re in a union,” explains the new Labour MP for Nottingham East, grinning. “My friends are always like: ‘Nadia, we’re going to get the shots in ...’ But politics is life, isn’t it? We live it every day.”</p><p>She is living it very differently these days, however. Almost overnight, Whittome went from living at home with her mum in Nottingham to representing her city in parliament and being grilled on the Today programme. Her election victory was a light on an otherwise dark night for the radical left. But it is a lot to take in for someone selected only 24 hours before the election was called and who had never lived away from home before she was elected (although she now has a flat in London for weeknights, she is still under her mother’s roof in her constituency). “People keep asking me how I feel, and the truth is there’s no time to process how I feel. I’m just getting on with the job,” she says. “It does feel really odd that, not very long ago, I was looking for Christmas temp work – got rejected from a lot of Christmas temp work – and now I’m a member of parliament.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/20/nadia-whittome-britain-youngest-mp-working-class">Continue reading...</a>

The booze-free drink market is worth at least double that if supermarket sales are taken into account as Britons try to cut their alcohol intake at home too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/20/uk-brewers-invest-in-low-alcohol-drinks-trend">Continue reading...</a>
