Universal Audio (UA) has introduced LUNA, a recording environment based around the UA Console for its line of hardware-accelerated audio interfaces and DSP chips. Since Universal Audio were very kind and hosted me at NAMM this year, I took some time to talk to them about this new product. It actually looks pretty cool and is free to all UAD hardware platform users.

The Roland booth at NAMM 2020 was a bit of a fustercluck. I had booked time there but I realized I didn't know what that meant and I couldn't find anyone I had talked to. So I hunkered down on the MC-101 and tried it out. This is that footage.

## Preset Surfing the Sequential Pro 3 at NAMM 2020

The Pro 3 is the brand new synth from Sequential. It's a 3 oscillator mono/paraphonic with a wavetable oscillator, multi-mode filter, awesome motion sequencer, great effects, and some other cool bells and whistles. 

I put my hands on one for the first time at NAMM 2020. This is that footage.

I didn't expect to love this thing as much as I did. It's got an incredibly unique sound, huge and techy, grungy and distorted, sharp and round. 

Please, papa Dave, notice me.

## Sonicware LIVEN Chiptune Groovebox Intro and Demo

The Sonicware LIVEN is a super unique little chiptuney synthesizer with a robust sequencer and internal resampling. I asked them to give me an intro and play demo, and then I came back and tried it myself later. It's not super easy to figure out without a manual, but it seems really cool.

Great price too. Check it here: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sonicware/liven-8bit-warps-8bit-wave-memory-synthesizer-8

## Surfing the Waldorf Kyra at NAMM 2020

I touched Waldorf's Kyra for the first time at NAMM 2020. This is that footage. 

I'm honestly not really feeling this synth. It feels like it wants to and could be a modern Virus TI but this was the synth I struggled most with in terms  of interface and tweaking. There are some really important controls not on the front panel and I didn't like the menu system. 

I think there's a very powerful synth under the hood here, but I didn't enjoy playing it that much.
