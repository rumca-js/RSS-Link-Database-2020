<p>The Brexit challenger on the battle to save our constitution, how she gets her adrenaline fix and her fears about the Weinstein trial</p><p>The justice campaigner Gina Miller won two landmark legal victories that forced the government to be accountable to parliament over Brexit. Her autobiography, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/aug/23/rise-gina-miller-review-woman-defeated-government-article-50" title=""><em>Rise</em></a>, charts an extraordinary life of challenges faced and traumas overcome, including harassment and violence. She was born in British Guiana, daughter of Doodnauth Singh, who educated himself despite modest beginnings to become attorney general of independent Guyana. She has lived in Britain since she was 11.</p><p><strong>In your new year Twitter message, </strong><strong>you quoted </strong><strong>Maya Angelou</strong><strong> about the need “to step off the road in a new direction”. Is that how</strong><strong> you feel?</strong><br />I chose it because what I’m finding quite worrying is that – on all sides – we seem to be stuck in a rut psychologically, emotionally and intellectually. And that’s not a good thing. The time for reflection didn’t seem to happen over Christmas. Maybe people still need to vent the anger before we move on. But we still seem to be stuck in these silos.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/11/gina-miller-i-think-keir-starmer-has-best-qualities">Continue reading...</a>
