Apple released its $5,000 ProDisplay XDR in December 2019 bragging about its capabilities compared to reference monitors used in Hollywood coloring houses that go for well over $50,000. While many remained skeptical, most praised the monitor as a heck of a deal. What didn't do so well, however, was the $1,000 Pro Stand for ProDisplay XDR. So... is it really worth $1,000? This parody character sure seems to think so... Joking aside, it's honestly not a very good monitor stand and we'll talk about why in our final review of the ProDisplay XDR coming soon.
