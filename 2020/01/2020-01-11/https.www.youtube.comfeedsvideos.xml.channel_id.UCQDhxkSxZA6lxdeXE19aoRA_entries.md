The decade old 5,1 Mac Pro's are still high performers when it comes to CPU and memory performance but the biggest bottle neck being the SATA 2 interface which offers painfully slow speeds compared to modern computers. In this video I am going to be taking this Mac to the max. 
Just how fast can the storage in this old Mac Pro go? and can it exceed Apples new Late 2019 Mac Pro?
