LYRICS

Hey you
It’s your birthday
So you
Can have free cake
Any other day you would have to pay
But today it’s your birthday

Hey you
Should have a good time
Go do
That thing you really like
With that
Person who wants to
Make your every wish come true

Everything you’ve ever dreamed

Nananananana
Yeah ok alright
This is your day
You can wear a unicorn hat if you wanna play
All night
That’s right
One, two, three
Nananananana
Yeah ok alright
It’s a good day
Do what you want not do what you should day
Go all night
But be polite
One two three
Nananananana

Hey you
It’s not your birthday
So you
Don’t get free cake
Unless you know somebody who
Will always give free cake to you

Everything you’ve ever dreamed
