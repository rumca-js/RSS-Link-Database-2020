Uh oh, the time travelling reporter is back and he's discovered a WHOLE BUNCH of social media platforms. How is he gonna explain Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube :/ Uh oh.

 Here's my Amazon "Influencer" link where you'll find all the equipment I use to make these videos! If you buy anything on Amazon through this link (not just items from this equipment list) Amazon gives me a little bit of money! And that lets me buy food for my cats!
