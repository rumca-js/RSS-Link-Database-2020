<p>The past five years – and the past decade – are the hottest in 150 years, the latest research has shown. It is bringing increasingly severe storms, floods, drought and wildfires, with one scientist saying the records being broken year after year is “the drumbeat of the Anthropocene”.

Sign up now!</a></p><p>Newcastle United are going to win the FA Cup for the first time since 1955, The Fiver really is beginning to believe it. Partly because they nearly fell at the first hurdle against Rochdale the other weekend, the perfect sliding-doors start to a Cup fairytale. Partly because Joelinton is now the sort of goalscoring machine that puts the likes of Malcolm McDonald, Kevin Keegan, Peter Beardsley, Andy Cole, Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer (combined major honours with the Toon: 0) to shame. But mainly because, when Newcastle finally win something again, which most mathematical models suggest they probably will at some point in the next few centuries, they’ll be managed not by a messianic bleeds-black-and-white Keeg/Bobby/Rafa-style crowd favourite, but an underwhelming and unpopular former Sunderland boss instead. The story, eight decades in the making and counting, is just bound to end that way.

<p>Don’t worry if you haven’t kept your promises this month: there’s always the rest of the year to feel the expectation to make yourself better</p><p>At the start of every year, my friends and I discuss new year resolutions: comparing and contrasting them, keeping each other on course and consoling each other when we’ve all caved come February. But a number of them were uncharacteristically unbothered about the chance to set goals at the start of the new decade. New year resolutions simply are not as relevant to them as they once were, now they are in perpetual pursuit of improvement.</p><p>The rise of “wellness” and the encroaching culture of public goal-setting means our resolutions start anew not annually but every few days.

First, that there is funny stuff on there; second, there is interesting stuff, too; and third – the main thing – that it is a sewer of vileness. I thought I had better take a look. I picked a pseudonym or nom de twit or whatever you might call it, sought advice on a few good follows, and off I went. I don’t tweet, I just watch; or lurk, perhaps.</p><p>My first shock was just how brilliant it all is. Following thinkers and writers from across the political spectrum, I have quickly learned an almost embarrassing amount about life and the universe and the different prisms through which people see them. I have come across very little vileness; I must be following the wrong people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/learned-to-love-twitter-once-muted-narcissism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This intriguing documentary shines a light on the astonishing career of the first woman to direct a film – and possibly the first director ever</p><p>Pamela B Green’s hectic, garrulous, fascinating documentary recovers the story of French film-maker Alice Guy-Blaché (working from Alison McMahan’s book Alice Guy-Blaché: Lost Visionary of the Cinema). She was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/mar/07/women-pioneers-of-early-cinema-alice-guy-blache-mary-pickford">a hugely important pioneer of early cinema</a> who was the first woman to direct a feature film – perhaps the first director ever – a figure admired by Eisenstein and Hitchcock, and a prolific director, screenwriter, producer and prototypical studio chief who helped invent the idiom of modern movie-making. The notice “Be Natural” on the wall of her Solax studio in New Jersey was a testament to her belief that, however stylised and generic, acting and films in general should not be bizarre pantomimes but artworks connected to the real world.</p><p>The documentary is narrated by its producer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/jodie-foster">Jodie Foster</a>, and tells the remarkable life story of a woman who was one of the first entranced witnesses to the Lumières’ initial screenings of their cinematograph invention in Paris. She was employed by a photography company taken over by Léon Gaumont, and from there developed her own interest in the cinema, directing what is perhaps the world’s first narrative film, entitled <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223341/">The Cabbage Fairy</a> (1896) and then establishing a studio in Fort Lee, New Jersey – the place where American movie-making happened before the big move west to Hollywood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/15/be-natural-the-untold-story-of-alice-guy-blache-review-first-female-film-director">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Invoking the dispute resolution process has upped the stakes, and it risks escalating the crisis</p><p>The three European parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal – France, Germany and the UK (known as the E3) – announced yesterday that they were triggering the agreement’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/european-states-trigger-dispute-mechanism-iran-nuclear-deal" title="">dispute resolution mechanism</a>. In a joint statement, the E3 insisted that the move was undertaken “<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/e3-foreign-ministers-statement-on-the-jcpoa-14-january-2020" title="">in good faith</a>” and was aimed at salvaging the accord in response to Iranian breaches, not expediting its collapse. But resorting to the mechanism could set in motion the deal’s demise, unless Europe engages both Tehran and Washington.</p><p>First, some context. The Trump administration abandoned the nuclear deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) to give it its official name, in 2018. It put in place biting sanctions against Iran. This unilateral move upended the multilateral bargain at the deal’s core, under which Iran restricted its nuclear programme and allowed rigorous international monitoring of its facilities in return for economic normalisation. With the deal’s remaining parties (France, Germany, the UK and the EU, along with Russia and China) failing to provide economic respite, Iran incrementally broke the deal’s restrictions, arguing that fewer financial dividends merit lessened compliance, a logic dismissed by the Europeans. While Tehran has ostensibly ceased observing key nuclear limits, it has not yet followed through with steps that would set off alarm bells, such as ramping up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/05/iran-announces-injection-of-uranium-gas-into-1044-centrifuges" title="">uranium enrichment</a> to 20% or limiting the access of international inspectors.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/europe-iran-nuclear-deal-dispute-resolution-process">Continue reading...</a>

American conceptual artist who cremated all his paintings in 1970 and later effaced the images of public figures with stick-on dots<p>A recent episode of The Simpsons saw America’s favourite dysfunctional cartoon family take a step back in time. In one scene, the young Marge Simpson, a reporter on the Springfield Shopper, interviews a local conceptual artist about his change of subject from mouths to noses. “So,” rasps Marge, “you’ve moved into painting giant schnozzes.” “Marge,” the artist replies, “the mouth has had its day. It’s time to find out what the nose knows.” The artist in question, who voiced his cartoon character himself, was John Baldessari, who has died aged 88.</p><p>Unusually for a conceptual artist, the maker of the (real) series titled <a href="https://artfacts.net/exhibition/john-baldessari-noses-ears-etc/56255" title="">Noses &amp; Ears, Etc</a>. (2006), was known for his sense of humour.

The study of 650 women, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-51093999">conducted by Imperial College London and KU Leuven in Belgium</a>, found that almost a third of women showed symptoms of PTSD a month after the miscarriage and 18% at nine months. Others experienced anxiety and depression as a result.</p><p>This raises the question of whether women are supported enough around early miscarriages. Given that most women do not share the news of their pregnancy until the 12-week scan, after which the risk of miscarriage reduces, many go through it without family, friends and colleagues knowing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/15/share-your-experiences-of-how-early-miscarriage-impacted-on-your-mental-health">Continue reading...</a>

How long can sport, like Hollywood, continue to wave away the contradictions between its activities and its supposed ideals?<p>Someone once told me about a film actor who had developed a powerful ecological conscience, and in this spirit he bought every cast and crew member on his latest production a reusable coffee cup. As the shoot wore on, he’d make spot checks to see if they were using them. This was a source of some irritation but more amusement to the crew, who’d observe darkly to each other that – with the best will in the world on the old coffee cup front – they were literally MAKING A MOVIE HERE. There are few more disposably indulgent, bigger footprint projects than creating a second-tier romantic comedy (unless it’s maybe failing to be able to tell the Spiderman story in less than two and three quarter hours).</p><p>It’s hard not to think about such ironies as far as sport the climate crisis go, and it will be even harder as the Australian Open gets under way this week.

## A 25C wash is greenest – but can it really clean filthy clothes?

Researchers claim a 30-minute, low-temperature cycle sheds fewer microfibres. Now the onus must be on detergent manufacturers to ensure their products work in colder water<p>Clothes washed at 25C on a 30-minute cycle shed fewer microfibres into waste water and keep their colour for longer, <a href="https://www.leeds.ac.uk/news/article/4524/quicker_and_cooler_is_best_for_clothes%0D" title="">researchers at the University of Leeds</a> have found. This makes sense. After all, consumers have long been advised by detergent manufacturers and environmental organisations to turn down the dial on the washing machine to 30C. Dropping to 25C is a small adjustment, but possibly a greater psychological one: will clothes really be clean at that temperature, and on such a short cycle?</p><p>Lucy Cotton, the report’s lead author, explains that 25C is usually the “inlet” temperature of water in a washing machine – the natural, unchilled and unheated temperature at which the water enters the drum. Her research tested the release of dye and of microfibres from a range of consumer clothing, such as Fruit of the Loom T-shirts. However, the clothes were not dirty when they went into the wash, and only the release of microfibres and desorption of dye were measured. “We weren’t testing for cleanliness,” she says. “One of the things that is useful about this study is that it puts the onus on detergent manufacturers to explore this area. Can they make the cleanliness happen in a cold, quick wash?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2020/jan/15/25c-wash-is-greenest-can-it-really-clean-filthy-clothes">Continue reading...</a>

The gardens and sculptures integrated into the park intensify the natural shapes and colours in the wider, wildlife-rich landscape, whether it’s a mossy willow by the Wensum or a weeping silver birch by Moon Water (Pensthorpe’s main lake). BBC Springwatch was filmed in the park three years running, looking out for badgers, barn owls and bullfinches.

As The Trial of Christine Keeler retells the Profumo affair from the women’s point of view, its star talks sex, scandal and solidarity</p><p>Any actor in regular paid employment could be described as having a charmed life, but it’s a particular kind of good luck to look exactly like Christine Keeler when the world is ready to have the Profumo affair retold from the perspective of Keeler herself. In fact, in the BBC’s flagship show <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/29/the-trial-of-christine-keeler-review-another-very-english-scandal">The Trial of Christine Keeler</a>, Sophie Cookson looks so like the protagonist that Keeler’s son said that, in one shot of her in the back of a car, it was as if he was seeing his mother. In real life, drinking mint tea in a cafe in London’s Gloucester Road, Cookson looks more like a friendly version of Keira Knightley. In other words, she could probably look like just about anybody.</p><p>What now seems fascinating about the Profumo affair is the realisation that we have been looking at this well-worn moment in British public life from such a strange angle: always from the point of view of the establishment. What mattered was what it meant for the secretary of state for war John Profumo, whose career ended when it was revealed that the teenager he had been “involved” with, Keeler, had also been “involved” with a Soviet naval attache. It was a political story with a cold war spying angle. Rarely, if ever, has it been seen for what it was: a sex scandal in which predatory men in late middle age procured teenage girls, then derided them as sex-crazed liars and schemers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/15/sophie-cookson-playing-trail-of-christine-keeler-vilification-profumo-affair">Continue reading...</a>
