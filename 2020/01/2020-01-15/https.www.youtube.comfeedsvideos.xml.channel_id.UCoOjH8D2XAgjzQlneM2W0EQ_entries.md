Depending on which study you read, in the next few decades, humanity will reach the singularity. The point at which computers will match or exceed human intelligence.

If you think about it, all humanity has ever achieved has been because of 3 factors: how much information we can take in, how much information we can process, and how much information we can put out.

Every problem we haven’t solved yet - curing cancer, going to mars, all comes back to how fast, or how slow, we can interact or interface with the world around us

The real bottleneck are the first and last factors

Compare that to artificial intelligence - when it reaches its singularity point, it will be able to think like us and process info like us, except it won’t have the bottleneck of physical bodies.

Humanity’s “interface” with the world, our senses and physical bodies have very “low bandwidth” as Elon Musk likes to call it

In 2017, Elon Musk launched a secretive startup called Neuralink.

Neuralink’s long term goal is to free humanity from this bottleneck by bypassing our archaic limbs altogether, and augment that connection between our brains and the outside world with a computer chip that connects the two together. AKA cyborgs with what’s called Brain-Machine Interface devices or BMI’s

Once you have the BMI installed, it would connect wirelessly to an outside wearable so you don’t have wires sticking out of your head and to a smartphone app

With something like this, as the technology progresses, Neuralink offer us, not just a way out, but a way in to ride the wave of real Ai, instead of being crushed by Skynet

A lot of people talk about how revolutionary Ai is, blockchain, even me with quantum computing
But if you think about it - all those innovations operate outside of humans, it’s just another tool we interact with
