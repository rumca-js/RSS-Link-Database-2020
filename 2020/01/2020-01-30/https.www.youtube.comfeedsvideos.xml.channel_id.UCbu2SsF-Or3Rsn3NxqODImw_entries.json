The Xbox One UI is notorious for being difficult to use, but this update improves things.\n\nUpdate #2002--which makes me wonder if there have been 2001 updates before this--is now available for people in the Xbox Insider Alpha-Ring, and in this video we're covering five new features that make the console look and perform even better. You can check out the full blog post on Microsoft's website to see a rundown of everything new in the update, as it also includes improvements for Mixer and data-storage.\n\nOverall, this new Xbox One dashboard is a welcome improvement on what has historically been a difficult-to-use platform. It still takes more than a few button presses to get where you want to go and see what you want to see, but I like the strides Microsoft has made here. Not only does the update give the Xbox One a facelift, it feels like the dashboard is snappier and more responsive, which means that while you still need a bunch of button presses to get where you're going, it moves along faster.\n\nThis update is expected to roll out for everyone in February, so be on the lookout for these features soon.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogxZJ89CqXM", "date_published": "2020-01-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Byleth Joins The Smash Bros.

Ubisoft's newest entry in the franchise tries to break into the auto battler genre, but will it be able to succeed?\n\nThe Might & Magic franchise is back--but perhaps not in the way you'd expect. Ubisoft's newest entry into the high fantasy series is a free-to-play auto-battler called Might & Magic: Chess Royale where you compete in one-on-one matches against 99 others until one person wins. \n\nSelf-described Might & Magic superfan Jess McDonell talks about why she's happy to see the Might & Magic series continue, but cautious as to whether the auto-battler genre is the right path forward. \n\nChess Royale is in an early access state right now on PC, iOS, and Android, and it currently feels shallow and lacking for a variety of reasons that Jess explores in the video. \n\nThat being said, Jess also talks about how Chess Royale has some redeeming qualities, and with the barrier to entry at $0.00, you might want to at least have a look. \n\nCheck out the full video above, and be sure to let us know if the draw of red dragons and harpies is enough for you to want to try this one out, if you've tried out the auto battler genre, or if you're still holding out hope that it isn't the end of the line for the Might & Magic franchise's mainline entries.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NIDn2HZPYU", "date_published": "2020-01-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
