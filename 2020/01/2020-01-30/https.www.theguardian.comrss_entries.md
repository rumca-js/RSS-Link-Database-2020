<p>Studies project rapidly deploying HPV vaccine in 78 of the world’s poorest countries could help prevent more than 74 million cases </p><p> More than 74m cervical cancer cases and 62m deaths could be averted in the next 100 years if 78 of the world’s poorest countries rapidly deploy HPV vaccinations, cervical screening and cancer treatment, two new studies have projected.</p><p>The predictive modelling is published on Friday in Lancet by Université Laval, Harvard University and Cancer Council New South Wales working with the World Health Organisation.

## Pollutionwatch: where would we be without EU environmental laws?

<p>Netherlands study offers UK good indication how it would have fared without EU rules</p><p>For more than four decades the UK contributed to EU-wide <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/index_en.htm">environmental law</a><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/air/index_en.htm">making</a>, but what have these regulations and directives done for us? The nearest data that we have comes from the Netherlands. There, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1352231019307484">scientists</a> compared two alternative realities for their country: one with no EU laws and a version of today’s reality. European-wide laws began with exhaust standards for cars in the 1970s. Acid rain and forest dieback led to industry regulation and limits for total air pollution that each country could produce. The <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=invisible+killer">final step</a> was to set minimum standards for the quality of the air that we all breathe.</p><p>Without EU laws, particle pollution in Amsterdam, Utrecht, Rotterdam and The Hague would have risen steadily to be about 10 times greater than they are today; only slightly better than <a href="https://www.who.int/airpollution/data/cities/en/">cities</a> across China, India and Iran. Average life expectancy across the Netherlands would be about six years shorter; that equates to about 66,000 extra Dutch deaths annually and a health cost of €35bn-€77bn (£30bn-£65bn) a year. The UK is further from some of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/oct/24/pollutionwatch-european-air-quality-map-exposes-dangers">Europe’s big pollution centres</a> than the Netherlands, but with a population that is four times greater, we can be sure that the impact of EU laws on annual deaths would be larger.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/30/pollutionwatch-where-would-we-be-without-eu-environmental-laws">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Labour can outflank the Tories by rethinking the firm and who controls its surplus rather than just nationalising it</p><p>In 1970 Milton Friedman published his seminal <a href="http://umich.edu/~thecore/doc/Friedman.pdf" title="">“greed is good” essay</a> in the New York Times magazine. In it the rightwing academic tarred managers who thought there were corporate responsibilities beyond profits as “unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society”. Friedman’s view of shareholder primacy became the conventional wisdom, boosted by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Since 1979 the idea that only company owners are the rightful claimants of the fruits of the economy gained traction. Nowadays shareholders are the central actor in economic life. This has been a damaging and unwise road to take.</p><p>Putting shareholders first means less cash for workers and other stakeholders, hampering efforts to tackle in-work poverty and climate change. While the UK’s largest listed companies have doubled in a decade the amount paid out to shareholders (<a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a711e64d-420e-4f61-bcf5-4a88dee950e4" title="">a record £110bn last year</a>), the average wage in November 2019, measured as weekly real pay, was <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/averageweeklyearningsingreatbritain/january2020" title="">lower</a> than in February 2008. If the £110bn was divided up between the <a href="https://merchantmachine.co.uk/profit-per-employee/" title="">5 million people</a> employed by the FTSE 100 companies, each worker would receive £22,000 each.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/the-guardian-view-on-labours-worker-ownership-plans-power-to-the-people">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ditching the heavy-handed slapstick of its last series, Larry David’s arch-misanthrope gets back to causing chaos in this furious return to form </p><p>When is it too late to wish someone a happy new year? In this opening episode of the 10th season of Curb Your Enthusiasm, belated felicitations join soft scones, wobbly tables and human bowls borrowed by dogs as the latest prompts for Larry David’s raging misanthropy. With characteristic cleverness, though, each of these minor irritants transitions into a crucial plot device with astonishing agility. After a two-year absence, this is a strong, confident and very funny return for the Seinfeld co-creator.</p><p>Some fans thought season nine was underrated, but I felt it lacked the vitality of the best of Curb – occasionally, watching it could be a bit of an endurance sport. The Guardian described its slapstick as <a href="https://theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/oct/13/the-new-curb-your-enthusiasm-is-appalling-slapstick-what-was-larry-david-thinking">“fourth-rate Benny Hill”</a>, Vulture said it felt <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/curb-your-enthusiasm-premiere-review.html?utm_source=nym&amp;utm_medium=f1&amp;utm_campaign=feed-full">“like a throwback in a bad way”</a>. It got better as it went along, but pegging the whole season to Larry writing a musical comedy about the fatwa on Salman Rushdie, which turned into him dealing with a fatwa of his own, felt like a stretch – even if Hamilton’s creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, did arrive to brighten everything up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/30/metoo-to-maga-curb-your-enthusiasm-is-back-and">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Manchester United’s new midfielder gained plenty from a spell in Italy before blossoming at Sporting to secure his big move</p><p>In a relatively small country, nothing stays a secret for too long. As Bruno Fernandes stepped outside his home and on to the street, he was swiftly doorstepped by a reporter from the television news station SIC. “It’s not the moment yet for my final message to Sporting fans,” he said with an amiable smile. Would he at least confirm that going to England was his preference? “It always was,” said Fernandes, without a second’s hesitation.</p><p>All things come to those who wait and how Sporting Clube de Portugal’s captain waited. In the past year it was abundantly clear that Sporting couldn’t hold him much longer, and with his talent demanding a wider audience it would have been so even if they had been in better financial shape. So <em>Sportinguistas</em> savoured every moment over that period, from last April’s stealthy rocket from range to oust Benfica from the Taça de Portugal in the semi-final to the deflected drive that put them on the road to victory in the final against Porto.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/30/bruno-fernandes-pass-master-goals-tempo-manchester-united-sporting">Continue reading...</a>

A chance to listen without passing judgment, and to break the habits of a lifetime by accepting some personal responsibility. However difficult and insincere that might be. Fake it to make it and all that. It was all most irregular, though highly effective. The day that Dom became Sub.</p><p>You’d have thought that what with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/28/the-guardian-view-on-huawei-and-5g-the-risks-are-real">UK’s decision to grant Huawei access to its 5G infrastructure</a> and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/donald-trump-israel-palestinians-middle-east">US going rogue both on Iran and a one-sided Middle</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/30/donald-trump-israel-palestinians-middle-east"> East peace</a> deal that didn’t involve the Palestinians, there might have been a little tension in the talks between Raab and Pompeo. But in the capable, Mogadon hands of Dean Godson, director of the thinktank Policy Exchange, neither man said a word out of place. Indeed they barely completed a sentence through which anyone – themselves included – could stay awake. As though the whole event had been deliberately designed to be as dull as possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/30/sub-dom-shrinks-in-the-face-of-big-mikes-stage-managed-bantz">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Everyone harbours a secret that could ruin them, don’t they? They certainly do in this addictive Netflix thriller based on the Harlan Coben page-turner. Don’t make any evening plans</p><p>Imagine the horror: you are busy getting on with your safe, middle-class existence, singing aloud to Springsteen with your kids while driving through suburban streets on your way to the dads v lads football match (actually it already sounds like a nightmare), when suddenly a stranger turns up, tells you a terrible secret then disappears, leaving you with nothing but all the information necessary to blow up your entire life.</p><p>That is the premise of The Stranger, an eight-part Netflix thriller predicated on the notion that everybody harbours at least one secret with destructive potential. Adam Price (Richard Armitage) is a lawyer with two kids, a vivacious wife called Corinne (Dervla Kirwan) and not much to concern him beyond his woeful goalkeeping. Then, after the match, a total stranger – a young woman in a baseball cap (Hannah John-Kamen), with a manner both flirtatious and menacing – drops into the seat beside him and tells him that Corinne’s pregnancy and subsequent miscarriage from two years before had been entirely faked.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/30/the-stranger-harlan-coben-netflix-review-was-she-ever-even-pregnant">Continue reading...</a>

## How do you know when the Oscars have gone vegan? Answer: they keep telling you

<p>New ways to save the planet are always welcome. So let’s hear it for the 100% plant-based menu the Academy will be serving its pampered guests this year</p><p>In many ways, all you need to know about any awards ever is that the Oscars telecast holds the record for most Emmy wins in history, having won 47 times and been nominated 195. As a reminder of the cap on human achievement, it’s up there with the ineluctable logic decreeing that ultimately Own Goal will end up being England’s top scorer. (Having previously topped the rankings, Own Goal is currently just behind Wayne Rooney. But don’t worry – it’ll have the top spot all to itself soon enough. No man can keep it down.)</p><p>Alas, though, no matter how garlanded the Oscars are, the Academy is always seeking out new affectations and ways to congratulate itself. It remains extremely unclear why – certainly to viewers, who watch the event in smaller and smaller numbers each year. Last year, the Oscars telecast <a href="https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/oscars-ratings-2019-1203144417/" title="">peaked at 29.6 million US viewers</a>, although the zombie statistic that it is watched by “a billion people around the globe” staggers on. Indeed, it presumably accounts for all the winners’ attempts to contemplate Big Themes in their humble speeches, which serve as thankful outreach to all the citizens of the world who make them possible. The Congolese children, for instance, who watch the Oscars to unwind after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/16/apple-and-google-named-in-us-lawsuit-over-congolese-child-cobalt-mining-deaths" title="">a day down the cobalt mine</a> surfacing the materials necessary for people to make memes on their phones about the red-carpet outfits.

<p>Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 thriller about the spread of a deadly virus has been back in the iTunes Top 10 – so is this epidemic another thing we can blame on Gwyneth Paltrow?<br /></p><p>Conventional wisdom has it that audiences flock to escapism in troubled times, but an unexpected new entry on the <a href="https://itopchart.com/gb/en/movies/" title="">UK iTunes movie rental chart </a>suggests otherwise. Nestling among the current hits is a film made nine years ago that paints a more terrifying picture of humanity than Joker and Downton Abbey combined. As the coronavirus scythes outwards from China, there have been enough rentals of Steven Soderbergh’s 2011 thriller <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/contagion-film-review" title="">Contagion</a> to propel the movie into the Top 10. (At the time of writing, it’s at No 13.) The picture, which stars Gwyneth Paltrow and concerns a deadly virus with the potential to decimate the global population, has, in a very real sense, gone viral.</p><p>Twitter users have been posting variations on the theme of: “Is it just me or did Contagion predict the coronavirus?” I missed Soderbergh’s film when it was released, and I happen also to be frightened of dying from viral pneumonia, so I killed two birds with one download and watched the movie this week. It’s true that the similarities are striking enough to suggest a case of life imitating … well, if not art exactly, then a top-of-the-line B-movie. In both fictional and real-life cases, the outbreak originates in China and in each instance bats are implicated. As a doctor (played by Jennifer Ehle) at the Centers for Disease Control explains: “Somewhere in the world, the wrong pig met up with the wrong bat.” Worst Tinder date ever.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion">Continue reading...</a>

## The psychology of small plates: why food service radically changes how much we eat

<p>Two hundred years ago a group of aristocrats changed the way we eat – for the worse. If you ever worry you’ll still be hungry after dessert, here’s why</p><p>I was confronted by a conundrum at the weekend. My sister had made chickpea curry for 14, and a lentil and mushroom curry, also for 14, and there were 22 of us, and if you’re wondering why there was no meat on this table, it’s because all the meat eaters of the older generation are dead. Take heed, carnivores. Oh, but also, there were sausages.</p><p>Anyway, hours in, when I was on my fourth or fifth helping, I noticed that there was no end to it. No, there was more of it than when we started. There was a lake of chickpeas. We had got to the “Would you like to take some home?” stage. And here’s what was truly bizarre: the quantities weren’t actually for 14; she had taken a recipe for two, and tripled it. So, it was basically two dishes for six, and it could have fed three generations of extended Williamses for a week. How is this possible? How do you explain this exponential thing that happens, when you scale up a recipe a few times and somehow end up with enough to feed 1,000 people?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/30/the-psychology-of-small-plates-why-food-service-radically-changes-how-much-we-eat">Continue reading...</a>

<p>David asks how best to tell if a PC is fast enough for community groups on a limited budget</p><p>I am working on a project that helps various groups in the community to become more PC proficient, and some clients now wish to purchase their own systems for the first time. What is the best advice to give them about specifications etc, bearing in mind their finite budgets?</p><p>A user who wants a desktop PC to deal with email and social media, office files, surfing the web and streaming some video will also need to buy peripherals, including a monitor. Some will need a printer. Often the advice will be to get the best PC possible, but they may not get the full benefit if other parts of the system are too compromised. <strong>David</strong></p><p>Almost every PC on the market will perform basic tasks such as writing emails and browsing the web. Even cheap laptops can run Microsoft Office and its rival suites, which are relatively lightweight by today’s standards. Most can also do simple photo and video editing, though rendering and other video processing tasks can take a very long time. The problem is not so much the type of task as the resources required by the software and the size of your files.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/jan/30/whats-the-minimum-specification-for-someone-buying-a-pc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Moving somewhere smaller and more design-efficient is sold as a lifestyle choice. Try telling that to those trapped in shoebox-sized accommodation<br /></p><p>Sheri Koones, author of Downsize: Living Large in a Small House, <a href="https://apnews.com/f094372b46bae82020c174907eb953c0" title="">recently suggested</a> renaming the downsizing trend “right-sizing”. Koones draws on her experience of relocating from a 6,800 sq ft house to a 1,400 sq ft one, and suggests that “the key is to have a home that is efficiently designed, both in terms of energy use and space”.</p><p>Of all the annoying lifestyle trends, downsizing is the biggest smack in the face for anyone in the private-renting trap. Shoebox-sized, sub-par rental accommodation is the norm in London, while nationwide studies show that homes are getting smaller. Younger adults who have managed to get on the housing ladder know all about the shortage of affordable, spacious accommodation.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/jan/30/downsizing-a-slap-in-the-face-for-the-young-and-poor">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘I’m from Texas, about 60 miles from the Mexican border. It’s hard to not think about the border when you live here’</p><p>I have photographed these sisters, Sam and Lizzy, many times, in many costumes, over many years. This was a particularly difficult time in my life. It was late February, and my mum had been killed in a car crash the September before. After she died, I just wasn’t interested in photography. My mother had liked to sew when I was young, so instead I started cutting up old clothes or using scraps to make crude flags. I was just trying to make sense of what was happening in my world. I thought I might use them as props in the future.</p><p>I was also going for daily walks with my dog, and a few houses down the road I came across this bizarrely tied-together pegboard fence. I see things cinematically. Bits of stories emerge from whatever I’m looking at. This image came from me sitting at my mother’s sewing machine, sewing those flags, and then finding that fence. I called up Sam and Lizzy and said: “I really need to do a picture – I need you to come over.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/30/nancy-newberry-best-photograph-restaging-spaghetti-western">Continue reading...</a>

Most of their chef-owners have chosen to return to their hometowns in attempt to wow customers with extravagant tasting menus, following experience at Spain’s top restaurants. This year’s winner – the first woman champion in 17 years of the contest – is Camila Ferraro, from Seville.

It’s about 6ft high and the width of my outstretched arms, but you can still see my shiny, plum-faced embarrassment through it. “First you hate the wall,” internationally renowned mime artist <a href="http://www.nolarae.com/">Nola Rae</a> prompts, as we scratch and smack at the stale air, “and now you love the wall.” We drool and shimmy against the imaginary bricks and I wonder if I’m secretly being filmed for a prank show.
