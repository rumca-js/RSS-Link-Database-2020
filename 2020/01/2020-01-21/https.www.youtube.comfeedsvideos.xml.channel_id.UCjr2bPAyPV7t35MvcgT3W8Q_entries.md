If you want to regain more control over your device and enhance your privacy and security, F-Droid is where you want to start. F-Droid gives you the opportunity to take your phone completely Google-free, because you can find a free and privacy-respecting alternative for pretty much any mainstream app on Play Store that doesnâ€™t sell your data to Facebook or Google. If you are running LineageOS or some other custom ROM, you can avoid Google privacy invasion through Play Store by using F-Droid instead.
