<p><b>WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT OF DEAD ANIMALS</b></p><p>An estimated 1 billion animals have been killed during or as a result of Australia's catastrophic bushfire season, and experts fear some species now face extinction. Huge numbers of mammals, birds, reptiles, insects and other species have been lost, with images of burned koalas and kangaroos fleeing the fire front beamed around the world. Slow-moving native animals have been hit particularly hard.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>'We really sleepwalked into this disaster,' says University of Sydney ecology professor Christopher Dickman, who explains what the crisis means for the country's wildlife and why it may take up to 100 years for the ecosystems the animals depend on to bounce back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/20/more-than-100-threatened-species-australian-bushfires-towards-extinction">More than 100 threatened species hit hard by Australian bushfires, pushing many towards extinction</a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/jan/21/will-australias-wildlife-recover-from-this-bushfire-season">Podcast: will native animals recover from this bushfire season?&nbsp;</a><br /><br /></li></ul> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2020/jan/22/why-it-could-take-a-century-for-australias-animals-to-recover-from-the-bushfires-video-explainer">Continue reading...</a>

## Why six-packs are an oppressive status symbol for women

<p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge said the washboard stomach she sported at the SAG awards was painted on by a makeup artist. Are these visible contours the height of body fascism?</p><p>The only time I have ever seen abdominal muscles that had actually been painted on by a makeup artist was on a man dressed as a pirate at a fancy-dress wedding. Fair enough; you would struggle to survive on the open seas without being buff. But this ab trend is generally more of a woman-thing, and finds its purest expression in Phoebe Waller-Bridge, as so many woman-things do: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/20/sag-awards-phoebe-waller-bridge-outstanding-female-actor-in-a-comedy-for-fleabag" title="">she appeared at the Screen Actors Guild awards</a> in midriff-centric attire by Armani Prive, looking as if she could have lifted a Robin Reliant simply by engaging her core. Her abs, though, were really all down to a shading effect, for which she thanked her makeup artist.</p><p>Visible contours have become a must-have status symbol for women, thanks not so much to the stomach crunching of pioneers, as the obsessive media watch: household names – Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Lopez – are boosted by their washboard tums, and there are definitely people, Bella Hadid, for one, whose myology I feel I know better than their professional output (although since Hadid is a model, you could say there was an overlap). I put it to you, patriarchy, that the six-pack is the ultimate policing of the female form, the point at which the requirement of ever-greater thinness – a basic and timeless tool of oppression – meets the demand for constant self-improvement and maximisation. In a contortion typical of late capitalism, the effort has become more important than the appearance, so you probably wouldn’t even make it as a beach body now if your stomach were merely flat. The message is very much on brand for perhaps even the apotheosis of body-fascism; there is no such thing as difference and variety, there is only trying and not trying, success and failure.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/jan/21/why-six-packs-are-an-oppressive-status-symbol-for-women">Continue reading...</a>

## If women ruled the world: Dior's Judy Chicago tribute is more than a gimmick

<p>Would buildings resemble wombs? Would God be female? Would there be violence?

Guests were seated within a custom version of an unrealised sculpture the influential feminist had first proposed in 1977 as Inflatable Mother Goddess. Chicago’s proposition “What If Women Ruled the World?” set the tone for a fashion collection inspired by proto-feminist heroines dating back to prehistory.</p><p>Embroidered banners, three-metres high, posed follow-on questions: “Would Buildings Resemble Wombs?” “Would God<strong> </strong>Be Female?” “Would There Be Violence?” “Would Both Women and Men Be Gentle?” It was a spectacular backdrop for the fashion show, though Chicago pointed out that the sculpture and its hangings were more than that. “We made art,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/t-magazine/dior-judy-chicago.html">she told the New York Times</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/21/dior-judy-chicago-feminist-banners">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sail to Spain’s lush northern coast for a memorable week-long drive from Santander to Bilbao, taking in world-class food, art and vistas along the way. Amanda Statham takes charge of the satnav</p><p><strong>Day one: sail to Santander</strong><br />Set sail from Portsmouth or Plymouth and, after a leisurely crossing, arrive the next day in Santander. Capital of the Cantabria region, it’s a fabulous mix of historic buildings, golden stretches of sand and atmospheric plazas. Begin your trip with a coffee and churros at <a href="https://www.chocolateriaaliva.com/" rel="nofollow">Chocolateria Aliva</a>, before taking a stroll through the ornate Banco Santander arch. Make your way to the gothic Catedral de la Asunción, some of which dates back to the 12th century, and explore the vaults and beautiful cloister. When your stomach starts to rumble, head to Barrio Pesquero (the fishing quarter) – it’s about a 20-minute walk from the city centre, but more than worth it for a table at <a href="http://www.lospenucas.com/" rel="nofollow">Los Penucas</a>, which serves delicious paella and squid. Enjoy an afternoon stroll along the promenade and dip your toes in the sea on El Sardinero, Santander’s most scenic stretch of sand. Finally, collect the car and head to the <a href="https://www.castillatermal.com/en/hoteles/balneario-de-solares/" rel="nofollow">Castilla Termal Balneario de Solares</a> hotel, which lies just outside the city and boasts a wonderful spa, complete with thermal spring pool – the ideal place to relax after a day’s sightseeing.</p><p><strong>Day two: journey west through the Asturias<br /></strong>Set the satnav for Oviedo and head west through the Asturias region, home to exhilarating scenery including the Picos de Europa mountains. A compact, characterful city, Oviedo’s impressive Catedral de San Salvador and <a href="https://www.turismoasturias.es/en/descubre/cultura/museos-y-espacios-culturales/museos/museo-arqueologico-de-asturias" rel="nofollow">Museum Arqueologico de Asturias</a>, which lies in a restored 16th-century monastery, are both must-visits. Treat yourself to tapas bites at the bar of <a href="http://www.tierra-astur.com/sidrerias-restaurantes-asturias/oviedo-gijon-aviles/inicio_10_1_ap.html" rel="nofollow">Tierra Astur</a>, or, if you can get a table, order a huge grilled veg platter and a sharing plate of local cheeses. Swap the city for sand in the afternoon, with a leisurely drive to the coastal city of Gijón, where green-fingered tourists flock to the Atlantic Botanical Garden which boasts thousands of varieties of plants and 400-year-old trees. Stay at <a href="https://www.parador.es/en/paradores/parador-de-gijon" rel="nofollow">Parador de Gijón</a>, a former mill set in Isabel la Católica park. From there, head off on foot to San Lorenzo beach for sunset, before returning to try hearty regional dishes such as fava bean and pork stew in the rustic restaurant.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-joy-of-slow-travel/2020/jan/21/sun-sea-and-sensational-scenery-a-grown-up-road-trip-in-northern-spain">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Cafe Oto, London<br /></strong>The indefatigable saxophonist breathes endless life into the standards, straddling the line between tension and release</p><p>The standard is a quintessential concept in jazz. A canonical composition reinterpreted and disassembled by both new players and established elders, they are works that cement their place in tradition through virtue of their lasting capacity to be transformed yet maintain the essence of their identity.</p><p>Defined like this, saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton is something of a standard himself. With more than 350 works to his name, he has been heralded as a luminary of free jazz, bearing influences such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/john-coltrane">John Coltrane</a> and Eric Dolphy, as well as a radical composer of opera and orchestral pieces in the lineage of experimentalists such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/karlheinz-stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>. His music often encapsulates what might be seen as “difficult” in jazz – rattling bursts of energy, woozy and unpredictable harmony, outright guttural noise – yet he always keeps a guiding hand on melody, maintaining his ineffable sonic identity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/21/anthony-braxton-standard-quartet-review-cafe-oto">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The team’s trip for a 1-1 draw with Australia involved an arduous trek across the globe and came with scandal and drama aplenty</p><p>England’s 500th Test match on foreign soil, which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/20/england-thrash-south-africa-third-test-cricket" title="">concluded in Port Elizabeth on Monday</a>, prompted a lot of people to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/15/england-500th-overseas-test-match-cricket" title="">reminisce about tours past</a>, but few could hope to match the tale of England’s voyage to their first ever away Test, played in Melbourne in March 1877. It is a tale of death, drama, donkeys and cross-dressing, and one that was thankfully diarised in sometimes excruciating detail by an unnamed player in a series of letters to the Sporting Life.</p><p>In all 255 days passed between the players setting sail from Southampton and their return to London’s Charing Cross station. The correspondent details every day of the outbound trip. Along the way they stopped at Gibraltar, Malta (“the beggars and guides are a perfect nuisance, pestering you the whole time”), Port Said and Suez at either end of the Suez Canal (“Suez is a wretched town. No pleasure can be got by a visit to the place, which is a tumble-down, narrow-streeted, stinking hole”), Yemen and Galle, before the players switched boats for the leg to King George’s Sound. Before they reached Malta one of their shipmates died. “About half-past 10 a death occurred on board, and at two the funeral took place. A very impressive ceremony – the ship stopping, and the knell tolling as the body was committed to the deep,” wrote the player. At Suez several players engaged in a donkey race, during which Allen Hill, the bowler who was to take the first ever Test wicket, fell off his ride and injured an elbow – the line of totally unnecessary injuries sustained by touring England cricketers engaged in completely unnecessary pursuits having started long before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/02/england-rory-burns-ankle-injury-before-second-test-south-africa" title="">Rory Burns did his ankle</a> playing football.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/21/england-first-test-tour-the-spin-death-brawling-betting-1877-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie ends her novel soon after the end of the Biafran war, though the trauma is far from over for her characters. With spoilers</p><p>It’s a historical fact that the Biafran war lasted from 1967 until 1970. But like all apparently objective historical facts, this one feels more subjective the more you look at it. For whom, exactly, did the war end? Active hostilities may have ended on 15 January 1970, but politically, Biafran independence remains a fraught question. Meanwhile, one of war’s tragedies is always that it never really ends for those who survive. Ceasefires cannot erase scars, loss or memories.</p><p>This lack of closure must have presented a challenge for Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie as she wrote Half of a Yellow Sun. On the one hand, there’s the natural breaking-off point at the declaration of peace. On the other, there’s the knowledge that to accurately represent the experience of her characters is to acknowledge the fact that they can never really leave their suffering behind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/21/half-of-a-yellow-sun-ends-abruptly-but-at-the-right-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Britain’s foremost food sorcerer has been away ‘resharpening his saw’ on a five-year hiatus from TV. As he returns, he talks self care, sexism – and much more </p><p>Heston Blumenthal doesn’t stop talking. At speed. His thoughts veer off in a thousand directions, seemingly simultaneously. “Question everything” is the motto the chef plumped for on the coat of arms he was granted a few years back, and he does just that: our conversation takes in Newton, Darwin, Homer, Harry Potter, the Bible, the Qu’ran, the invention of the telephone, the invention of social media, breathing, Jaws and saws.</p><p>The violence of the last two make me blink. Having spoken out in 2015 about TV becoming “too formulaic” and subsequently disappearing from our screens, Blumenthal likens the need to take a step back to the scene in Jaws where Roy Scheider is on the beach and hears a scream in the water, as the camera simultaneously zooms out and moves in. He segues swiftly into another metaphor, of a carpenter sawing away with an ever-blunter implement. “He should stop and have a rest,” he says, “resharpen his saw and start again. But when you’re in the middle of it, you think ‘I can’t stop, I don’t have time.’” Is this a sign of the culinary wizard coming back an even more intense character? Or perhaps he’s just bringing the drama he’s famous for in the kitchen to our conversation. “I have some funny metaphors I still need to work on,” he concedes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/21/heston-blumenthal-the-most-intimate-relationship-you-can-have-with-your-breath">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are vulnerable young Vietnamese people being routinely trafficked into the UK to work in cut-price nail salons? Amelia Gentleman joins a police raid on one shop suspected of involvement in exploitation</p><p>Online reviews for this small south-London nail bar are mixed. “Best nail bar in Peckham,” one says. Most comments, however, are more grudging. “Suppose you get what you pay for,” another concludes (customers here do not pay very much, just £10 for a full manicure). Most telling are the comments about the staff. “The younger girls and boys seem to be learning as they go”; “Communication is close to none as they don’t speak English.”</p><p>It is this lack of English that is one of the warning flags that has put the shop on a list of nail bars requiring investigation for possible exploitation.

<p>The Wigan MP, who is standing for the leadership of her party, seems to have actually had a life – which sets her apart from the field</p><p>‘There are no fit men at this university,” wrote Lisa Nandy in her university newspaper. “The only solution is to quit the manhunt and wait till after uni when you’re back among normal people.” She also posed in what the Mail on Sunday described as a “steamy photo casebook” in bed with another woman. All this makes me like her even more than I already do, and I like her a lot. I may as well say that now, as she is not seen as a big contender in the Labour leadership contest. But she and Jess Phillips seem like people with lives I can relate to.</p><p>I don’t have a dog in the contest – not even a miniature poodle – and am aghast at how long it is going to take. Is Jeremy Corbyn simply going to sulk in situ until April? Keir Starmer is safe and dull, and should pass the mic.

<p>The scheme’s new list of activities, such as becoming a mentor, can help young people build meaningful lives</p><p>Do you really have to suffer to “build character”? This narrative was particularly pervasive during the slog of my secondary school years – and never more so than when my teachers talked about the Duke of Edinburgh award. The scheme, which is aimed at 14- to 24-year-olds, centres on the idea of “personal development”, and certainly pushed students to their limits when I was at school. Gaining the certification – split into sections of “skills”, “physical”, “volunteering” and “expedition”, – demanded months of work and hobby-building. But the DofE’s bronze-level main event was the gruelling, day-long expedition.</p><p>I’ll never forget when my sister and her friends in the years above me participated. The day after the trek she asked to stay home sick, and when I got to school her friends were a mass of anguished groans, achy arms and wobbly thighs. When my time came to sign up, I was told the award would look great on my university personal statement – like so many other unappealing activities, such as attending talks, giving classroom tours, joining chess club, that teenagers are faced with in the later phase of school. But it was a firm no from me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/21/duke-of-edinburgh-award-climb-mountains-build-character">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How the president’s reckless fixation on immigration threatened to shatter democracy. By Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig</p><p>‘I alone can fix it.” On 21 July 2016, as he accepted the Republican presidential nomination in Cleveland, Ohio, Donald John Trump spoke more than 4,000 words, but these five would soon become the tenet by which he would lead the nation.</p><p>That night, Trump stood by himself at the centre of Quicken Loans Arena on an elevated stage, which he had helped to design. A massive screen framed in gold soared behind him, projecting a magnified picture of himself along with 36 American flags. This was a masculine, LED manifestation of his own self-image. His speech was dark and dystopian. He offered himself to the American people as their sole hope for renewal and redemption. Past presidential nominees had expressed humility, extolled shared values and summoned their countrymen to unite to accomplish what they could only achieve together.
