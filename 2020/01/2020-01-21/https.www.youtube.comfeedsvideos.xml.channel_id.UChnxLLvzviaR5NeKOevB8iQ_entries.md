Universal Audio (UA) has introduced LUNA, a recording environment based around the UA Console for its line of hardware-accelerated audio interfaces and DSP chips. Since Universal Audio were very kind and hosted me at NAMM this year, I took some time to talk to them about this new product. It actually looks pretty cool and is free to all UAD hardware platform users.
