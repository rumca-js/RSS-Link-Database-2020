See Ben Collins' now-deleted tweet or this montage of CNN and MSNBC for example.\r\n\r\n   \"They're not coming to peacefully protest. They are coming to intimidate and cause harm,\" Gov Northam said declaring a state of emergency and banning all carrying of guns in the capital square.\r\n\r\n    22,000 gun rights activists showed up and finished peacefully. They even cleaned up after themselves.   People were openly and legally carrying firearms, including AR-style rifles, outside the gun-free Capitol Square.\r\n\r\n   Story 2 -  Bernie Sanders Clarifies His Gulags Will Be Democratic Gulags\r\n\r\n   Project Veritas (James O\u2019Keefe, a conservative political activist) releases undercover video of one of Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201ctop tier Iowa organizer\u201d Staffer Kyle Jurek saying cities [will] burn\u201d if President Donald Trump is re-elected, \u201cfree education\u201d policies to \u201cteach you how to not be a \"flowerbed\"-ing nazi.\u201d; 'There is a reason Stalin had Gulags'; 'Expect violent reaction' for speech. If Bernie doesn't get nomination \"Milwaukee will burn\"... Project Veritas says they have more clips of more people too.\r\n\r\n   The video has millions of views, almost zero coverage in mainstream media, and zero comment from Sanders campaign.\r\n\r\n   Story 3 -  Pelosi Releases Limited-Edition Replica Of Dentures Worn During Trump Impeachment\r\n\r\n   'They claim it's a somber, serious occasion they're heartbroken over...and then they pass out impeachment-signing pens with special cases.'\r\n\r\n   The pens look like they are especially engraved, with gold, and were brought out on silver platters of some kind.\r\n\r\n   Hate Mail - We got a special flowerbed-filled hate mail this week that trashed us and our audience.\r\n\r\n Topic of the Week - Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Race\r\n\r\n   MLK Jr was the most visible spokesperson for civil rights through non-violent protest movements inspired by Mohatma Ghandi/India Independence. \r\n\r\n   1955 organized Montgomery bus protest after Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat.\r\n\r\n   Fought against desegregation and for voter\u2019s rights\r\n\r\n   In 1963 March on Washington gave his 'I Have A Dream' speech\r\n\r\n   In 1964 won the nobel peace prize.\r\n\r\n   Was investigated and spied on by the government for his supposed communist sympathies\r\n\r\n   Assassinated in Memphis, TN in 1968.\r\n\r\n   Joe Carter of TGC has  9 things you need to know about him. \r\n\r\n   Dr.  Robert Gagnon points out some of the controvery in modern evangelical circles regarding whether we should we praise King while condemning Trump.\r\n\r\n     Is MLK cancelled? \r\n\r\n   Conservatives and leftists both try to make MLK Jr supports their views on social justice, economics, or affirmative action.\r\n\r\n   What does the Bible say about race?\r\n\r\n   What did MLK\u2019s speech actually say ( we read from lengethier sections)\r\n\r\n   \"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.\"\r\n\r\n   \"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.\"\r\n\r\n   \u201cUnearned suffering is redemptive.\u201d Ethan also mentions Man\u2019s Search For Meaning\r\n\r\n       What are some principles we can apply to the race issue to cut through the...", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvTDCNbVJP8", "date_published": "2020-01-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
