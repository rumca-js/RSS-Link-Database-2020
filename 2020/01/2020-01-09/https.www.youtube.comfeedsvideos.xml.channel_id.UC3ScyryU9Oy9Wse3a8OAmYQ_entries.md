A new FRONTLINE documentary traces the use of online misinformation at high levels of the American political conversation back years further than the 2016 election — to Sarah Palin, a former Alaska mayor and the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate.

“She is the first of a generation of politicians who live in a post-truth environment. She was, and there’s no polite way to say it, but a serial liar,” Steve Schmidt, who helped lead John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and pushed him to choose Palin as his running mate, tells FRONTLINE in the upcoming documentary America’s Great Divide: From Obama to Trump.

“She would say things that are simply not true, or things that were picked up from the Internet,” the former GOP operative, who had also worked as a campaign adviser to President George W. Bush, continues. “And this obliteration of fact from fiction, of truth from lie, has become now endemic in American politics. But it started then.”

This excerpt from the series explores how, as President Barack Obama made health care reform a priority in 2009, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate reemerged — exploiting fear with a new phrase that went viral, “death panels,” and taking to Facebook to spread the false claim directly to her audience.

A new FRONTLINE documentary points to Sarah Palin as a precursor to Donald Trump: Plain-spoken and not “too high-brow,” she entered the national political scene as a “almost a pre-Trump” and “electrified that GOP base like no one I had ever seen,” former Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly says in this excerpt from “America’s Great Divide: From Obama to Trump.”

The McCain-Palin ticket wouldn’t prevail in the 2008 election, but the anti-establishment fervor Palin had tapped into would only grow -- helping to pave the way for Donald Trump's rise.
