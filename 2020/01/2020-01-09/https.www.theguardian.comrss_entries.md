The panel, chaired by Anil Kumble, will offer its recommendation to the world governing body’s executive committee, with such a significant change likely to also require sign-off from the full ICC board before being implemented.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/andrew-strauss-five-day-tests-icc-four-day">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The FA has questions to answer but so too do governments past and present over the rapid rise of football betting since deregulation in 2005</p><p>It was, on the face of it, classic haplessness of the Football Association to have used the FA Cup third round as a stage for its “take a minute” <a href="http://www.thefa.com/news/2019/dec/02/fa-cup-third-round-one-minute-heads-up-021219" title="">campaign for mental health</a>, while a clutch of matches were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/08/fa-cup-seven-uk-betting-companies-streaming-games" title="">streamed live</a> exclusively on betting sites, a looming risk to financial and mental health.

## The Doll by Ismail Kadare review – a fascinating study of difficult love

The Albanian author explores his relationship with his mother and bittersweet memories of home<p>At first acquaintance, Ismail Kadare’s autobiographical novel can be read as an elegant, slightly bittersweet coming-of-age memoir, touched with nostalgia for a homeplace that is now long lost. That homeplace is the Albanian city of Gjirokastra and, more specifically, the house of Kadare’s parental ancestors, a cold but historic stone edifice that divides the two women who must share it. On the one hand, Kadare’s grandmother, its original mistress, refuses to leave the place, attempting, so it seems, to grow into the very fabric of the building. By stark contrast, his mother – the Doll of the title, who enters this dilapidated pile as a defenceless young bride – is altogether overwhelmed by having to endure her disdainful mother-in-law’s dominion, claiming that “this house eats you up”. It is here, in the midst of a conflict that is mostly tacit but nevertheless deeply felt, that the precocious teen grows into a would-be litterateur, writing one “novel” after another that consist mainly of the “big-headed” young author proclaiming his incipient genius. He even decorates each tome with its own price tag in the old, pre-communist currency and “advertisements” of its brilliance and originality.</p><p><em>The Doll</em> is full of compelling details of life in a changing Albania, as the citizenry come to terms with various hues of communist rule under Soviet-backed Enver Hoxha. One of the funniest accounts is of the day, in 1953, when condoms arrive for the first time in the pharmacy: “There were contradictory instructions permitting and prohibiting them. It was suspected they might be a test to identify any weakening of the class struggle after the death of Stalin. But then it was realised that the measure was at the insistence of the Soviets and was linked to women’s rights (Rosa Luxemburg, etc), and after some hesitation by the party committee over whether communists should be advised to avoid the pharmacy and leave those bits of rubber to the increasingly depraved bourgeoisie, everything calmed down.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/09/the-doll-by-ismail-kadare-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 31-year-old quarterback looked like the best he could hope for was a role as a back up. Then he went to Tennessee and transformed his career</p><p>When the Tennessee Titans face the Baltimore Ravens in Saturday’s divisional round of the NFL playoffs, one quarterback will take the field and stick it to the critics who questioned his ability to thrive at the position. In between, one supposes, Lamar Jackson will take some snaps, too.</p><p>To be clear: no signal-caller has had a better season than Jackson, the Ravens’ dazzling dual threat, whose <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/11/lamar-jackson-mvp-baltimore-ravens-nfl-wrap">inevitable coronation as the league’s most valuable player</a> is sure to make even bigger fools of the talent evaluators who pegged him as a better fit at wide receiver or running back <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/is-the-criticism-of-qb-lamar-jackson-rooted-in-racism/">simply because he’s black</a>. But if there’s a redemption story that comes close, it’s Ryan Tannehill of the Titans. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14876/ryan-tannehill">This past season</a> saw the quarterback register Joe Montana-like numbers in completion percentage (70.3) and yards per attempt (9.6), while throwing 22 touchdowns against six interceptions. For an encore the 31-year-old made his maiden playoff appearance last week and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/04/tennessee-titans-new-england-patriots-playoff-score">led the Titans to a road upset</a> of the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. And while Tannehill didn’t perform anywhere near his best against the Patriots’ top-ranked defense, logging 15 attempts for a scant 72 yards while throwing an interception and fumbling twice, he did toss an early touchdown that set the table for Tennessee’s second playoff win in 11 seasons.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/09/ryan-tannehill-titans-ravens-nfl-playoffs-quarterback">Continue reading...</a>

## Fitbit for chickpeas, Zipcar for leftovers: the food tech we really need in the 2020s

From a way to share recipes to an alert when you have run out of Nutella, these apps could revolutionise the way we eat<p>What useful things could the tech of the 2020s bring to our diet? In the 00s, for a brief time, there was a website you could go to when you had made too much lamb cobbler (say), so you could take it round to a neighbour who was too frazzled or infirm to make one of their own. It was the most charming idea, which never took off: you would log on, and the nearest taker would be in Birmingham, or a vegetarian, or they had made a stew of their own. It was like some ancient barter system gone wrong, where everybody was making weapons but nobody was breeding any rabbits.</p><p>That’s the first app someone should invent this decade: leftovers sharing that actually works. If Zipcar works (it really shouldn’t, on paper, driving off and <a href="https://support.zipcar.co.uk/hc/en-gb/articles/115008083887-Roundtrip-or-Flex-" title="">leaving cars at random</a> – the entire fleet ought to wind up outside the same bar), somebody can tackle food. Ideally, it would team up with a driving app so you could leave your casserole in a hire car, though I left some taramasalata in a glove compartment once and that went really badly for me. People still talk about how disgusting I am.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/09/fitbit-for-chickpeas-zipcar-for-leftovers-the-food-tech-we-really-need-in-the-2020s">Continue reading...</a>

## A World Without Work by Daniel Susskind review – should we be delighted or terrified?

<p>It has long been argued that workers will be replaced by machines, but now the threat is real. How will we bring about a revolution in both work and leisure?</p><p>Oscar Wilde dreamed of a world without work. In <em>The Soul of Man Under Socialism</em> (1891) he imagined a society liberated from drudgery by the machine: “while Humanity will be amusing itself, or enjoying cultivated leisure … or making beautiful things, or reading beautiful things, or simply contemplating the world with admiration and delight, machinery will be doing all the necessary and unpleasant work.” This aesthete’s Eden prompted one of his most famous observations: “Is this Utopian? A map of the world that does not include Utopia is not worth even glancing at.”</p><p>In Wilde’s day the future of work was the first question that every aspiring utopian, from Edward Bellamy to HG Wells, needed to answer. Everything else, from gender relations to crime prevention, flowed from that. But proponents of the more attainable goal of drastically shorter working hours have also included Benjamin Franklin,<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2013/nov/18/bertrand-russell-philosopher-religion-ethics-life" title=""> Bertrand Russell,</a> AT&amp;T president Walter Gifford and<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/05/seven-things-john-maynard-keynes" title=""> John Maynard Keynes</a>. When the great economist coined the phrase “technological unemployment” (“unemployment due to our discovery of means of economising the use of labour outrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour”) in <em>Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren</em> (1931), he focused on the potential benefits a century hence.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/09/world-without-work-david-susskind-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Adam Sandler gives a terrific, career-best performance as a Manhattan jeweller with a perilous gambling habit in a rollicking, high-energy thriller</p><p>This sensationally good New York crime drama is rocket-fuelled with greed and crack-fumed with fear. It is directed by the Safdie brothers, Benny and Josh, who create something deliciously horrible, working with their longtime screenwriter-collaborator Ronald Bronstein. It conjures up the work of James Toback and John Cassavetes – and indeed early Martin Scorsese, who is an executive producer here. There is a consistency of purpose that their earlier film, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/25/good-time-review-robert-pattinson-safdie-brothers-cannes-2017">Good Time</a>, lacked. In its unforced, gripping, black-comic chaos, Uncut Gems resembles nothing so much as a super-violent, feature-length episode of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/curb-your-enthusiasm">Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>.</p><p>The Safdies have cast as their leading man <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/adamsandler">Adam Sandler</a> who gives a glorious, career-best turn as a fast-talking Manhattan diamond dealer called Howard Ratner (dare we hope for a cheeky reference to the British jeweller Gerald?), sporting a black leather jacket, dark glasses, earrings and an ingratiating, unreliable grin. Sandler has been known for pretty crass comedies in the past, though polite broadsheet opinion traditionally makes an exception for his performance in Paul Thomas Anderson’s 2002 film <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2003/feb/07/artsfeatures1">Punch-Drunk Love</a>.

What links an eccentric Oxford classics don, the millionaire US evangelicals with money to burn and a tiny, missing fragment of an ancient manuscript? Charlotte Higgins unravels a multimillion-dollar riddle<p>To visit Dr Dirk Obbink at Christ Church College, Oxford, you must first be ushered by a bowler-hatted porter into the stately Tom Quad, built by Cardinal Wolsey before his spectacular downfall in 1529. Turn sharp right, climb a flight of stairs, and there, behind a door on which is pinned a notice advertising a 2007 college arts festival, you will find Obbink’s rooms. Be warned: you may knock on the door in vain. Since October, he has been suspended from duties following the biggest scandal that has ever hit, and is ever likely to hit, the University of Oxford’s classics department.</p><p>An associate professor in papyrology and Greek literature at Oxford, Obbink occupies one of the plum jobs in his field. Born in Nebraska and now in his early 60s, this lugubrious, crumpled, owlish man has “won at the game of academia”, said Candida Moss, professor of theology at Birmingham University. In 2001, he was awarded a MacArthur “genius” award for his expertise in “rescuing damaged ancient manuscripts from the ravages of nature and time”. Over the course of his career, he has received millions in funding; he is currently, in theory at least, running an £800,000 project on the papyrus rolls carbonised by the eruption of Vesuvius in AD79.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/09/a-scandal-in-oxford-the-curious-case-of-the-stolen-gospel">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Indecently funny in every way' – Peter Cook's legacy by Eddie Izzard, Lucy Porter and more

<p>His influence is everywhere – but is the great, groundbreaking comedian being forgotten? Twenty-five years after his death, we reassess his impact </p><p>The reports of Peter Cook’s death on 9 January 1995 had no difficulty arriving at a consensus about him, but then there had been plenty of time to consider his legacy. Although Cook was only 57, his triumphs and innovations were generally agreed to lie in the distant past. There was Beyond the Fringe, the groundbreaking revue he wrote and performed with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/alanbennett">Alan Bennett</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/27/sir-jonathan-miller-obituary">Jonathan Miller</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/mar/28/guardianobituaries.media">Dudley Moore</a>, and which brought new bite to British satire. There was Not Only … But Also, the TV sketch comedy in which he and Moore played Pete and Dud, a pair of flat-capped, mackintosh-wearing amateur philosophers. And there were the improvised Derek and Clive albums that pushed comedy into the realms of scabrous obscenity.</p><p>Even toward the end of his life, Cook was still an inspired improviser. This could be in an official capacity (in Why Bother?, upper-class braggart Sir Arthur Streeb-Greebling, one of his longest-running characters, was quizzed by the young satirist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/chris-morris">Chris Morris</a>) or in an impromptu one (he would call late-night radio phone-ins under assorted guises including Sven the Norwegian fisherman). But such activity did nothing to subdue the image of Cook as a man with a bright future behind him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/09/peter-cook-comedian-legacy-eddie-izzard-lucy-porter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fitness coaches don’t all start out as slim and healthy twentysomethings. Here’s how three overcame obesity and illness – and their advice for the rest of us</p><p>‘Don’t go on a diet.” That’s one tip from personal trainer <a href="https://bighealthandfitness.co.uk/" title="">Graham Waugh</a>, 50, and may be surprising given that he once weighed three times as much as he does now. A few years ago, he was 330kg (52st) and stuck at home, feeling as if he was waiting to die. Exercise had never been a part of his life, but after bariatric surgery, he began visiting the gym. When his weight reached 111kg (17.5st), the gym owner suggested he become a personal trainer. “I said: ‘You’re joking, aren’t you? I’m too fat and old.’” But then Waugh realised he could specialise in training people who had had similar problems with their weight and health. “I’d seen a lady in the waiting room at the obesity clinic and she looked plump, at worst. I thought to myself: ‘If she had a gym she felt comfortable in, maybe she wouldn’t need surgery.’”</p><p>Waugh isn’t the only personal trainer with a powerful life story. For many trainers, it is the enormous change to their health and happiness that they experience at the gym that leads them into their chosen field – whether they have lost weight, gained strength or tackled physical or mental health issues. A prominent recent example is the former deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, 52. When he announced he was stepping down from politics in November, he also revealed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/12/tom-watson-lost-seven-stone-reversed-type-2-diabetes-interview" title="">he was retraining as a gym instructor</a>. Watson has been on what he describes as a “health journey”, losing 51kg (8st), and reversing his type 2 diabetes diagnosis through diet and exercise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/09/lose-220kg-beat-back-pain-love-yourself-personal-trainers-on-lessons-that-changed-their-lives">Continue reading...</a>
