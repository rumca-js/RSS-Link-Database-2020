She was, and there\u2019s no polite way to say it, but a serial liar,\u201d Steve Schmidt, who helped lead John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign and pushed him to choose Palin as his running mate, tells FRONTLINE in the upcoming documentary America\u2019s Great Divide: From Obama to Trump.\n\n\u201cShe would say things that are simply not true, or things that were picked up from the Internet,\u201d the former GOP operative, who had also worked as a campaign adviser to President George W. Bush, continues. \u201cAnd this obliteration of fact from fiction, of truth from lie, has become now endemic in American politics. But it started then.\u201d\n\nThis excerpt from the series explores how, as President Barack Obama made health care reform a priority in 2009, the 2008 Republican vice presidential candidate reemerged \u2014 exploiting fear with a new phrase that went viral, \u201cdeath panels,\u201d and taking to Facebook to spread the false claim directly to her audience.\r\n\nFor the full story, stream \u201cAmerica\u2019s Great Divide: From Obama to Trump\u201d -- a two-night, four-hour documentary series on how America\u2019s polarized politics came to be that provides new insights and crucial context for the 2020 election year.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Great Divide: From Obama to Trump\u201d will be available first, in its entirety, at pbs.org/frontline, at pbs.org and on the PBS Video App. Stream the full two-part, four-hour series there beginning Mon., Jan. 13 at 6 p.m. E.S.T./5 p.m. C.S.T.
