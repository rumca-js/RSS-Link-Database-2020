That homeplace is the Albanian city of Gjirokastra and, more specifically, the house of Kadare\u2019s parental ancestors, a cold but historic stone edifice that divides the two women who must share it.

A few years ago, he was 330kg (52st) and stuck at home, feeling as if he was waiting to die. Exercise had never been a part of his life, but after bariatric surgery, he began visiting the gym. When his weight reached 111kg (17.5st), the gym owner suggested he become a personal trainer. \u201cI said: \u2018You\u2019re joking, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m too fat and old.\u2019\u201d But then Waugh realised he could specialise in training people who had had similar problems with their weight and health. \u201cI\u2019d seen a lady in the waiting room at the obesity clinic and she looked plump, at worst.
