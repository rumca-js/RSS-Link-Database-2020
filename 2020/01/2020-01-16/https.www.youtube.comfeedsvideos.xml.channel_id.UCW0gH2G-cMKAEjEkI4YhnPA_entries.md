With the recent passing of Christopher Tolkien, I wanted to share my thoughts, and gratitude, when it comes to this instrumental figure in expanding the world of Middle-earth.  From Silmarillion, to the History of Middle-earth, to his three recent publications of The Children of Húrin, Beren and Lúthien, and The Fall of Gondolin, Christopher Tolkien has played a pivotal role in realizing his father, JRR Tolkien's vision for the world he created.

In this video, I share my thoughts, condolences, and appreciation for the incredible work done by Christopher Tolkien over the past four decades.  Namárië, Christopher Tolkien.  You have shown your quality - the very highest.
