From Silmarillion, to the History of Middle-earth, to his three recent publications of The Children of H\u00farin, Beren and L\u00fathien, and The Fall of Gondolin, Christopher Tolkien has played a pivotal role in realizing his father, JRR Tolkien's vision for the world he created.\n\nIn this video, I share my thoughts, condolences, and appreciation for the incredible work done by Christopher Tolkien over the past four decades.  Nam\u00e1ri\u00eb, Christopher Tolkien.  You have shown your quality - the very highest.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc6gbGr4FGA", "date_published": "2020-01-17 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
