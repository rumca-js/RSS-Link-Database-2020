<strong>David Purvis</strong> wishes the departing Guardian columnist well after 26 years of inspirational writing<p>I was sad to read in his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/10/bleak-times-thrive-last-column-guardian" title="">column last week</a> that Gary Younge will be leaving the Guardian. I’ve enjoyed his work over his years at the paper, which I always found informative, entertaining and thought-provoking, and I will miss his writing. His series of dispatches from the American south a few years ago was especially timely; his ongoing warnings and coverage of the dangers posed by racism, intolerance and prejudice has proved to be increasingly important, as over the last five years we’ve seen these topics drive a wedge through societies at home and abroad.</p><p>His parting words in his last column summed up our current situation, advocated resistance in the face of adversity, and will, I hope, prove inspirational to others: “The propensity to despair is strong, but should not be indulged. Sing yourself up. Imagine a world in which you might thrive, for which there is no evidence. And then fight for it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/16/gary-younge-will-be-greatly-missed">Continue reading...</a>

For the world’s biggest fund manager and its fellow shadow banks, self-policing can never be sufficient<p>Let’s not beat about the bushfires.

Since 1996, only two jockeys have held the title, Sir Anthony McCoy being succeeded on his retirement by Richard Johnson, but a dogged and determined effort at breaking that hegemony is being made by Brian Hughes and it promises to turn the last three months of this season into a day-by-day battle.</p><p>Aged 34, Hughes is not as well known as he should be beyond racing’s core supporters, even though a dozen years have passed since he was champion conditional jockey, the brightest talent among the sport’s junior ranks at the time.

<p>A Dog’s Tale, written by cat-loving playwright Poppy Hollman, tells the story of a British institution and has a canine/feline rap battle</p><p>Tom Hooper’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/19/cats-review-tom-hooper-judi-dench-idris-elba-taylor-swift">extravagant blockbuster</a> may have given cats all the attention but a lovably scruffy new stage musical puts their canine rivals in the spotlight. A Dog’s Tale, written by Poppy Hollman, is a story of terrors and terriers, charting the frayed nerves and fierce competition at Crufts. Hollman’s play, which will tour the UK, explores the famous dog spectacular’s origins in the Victorian era, with the ambitious Charles Cruft – who masterminded the first event in 1891 – emerging as a PT Barnum figure. It is not so much the Greatest Showman, perhaps, as the Best-in-Showman.</p><p>Hollman says her “guilty secret” about the comedy, which is her first professional commission, is that she shares her family home not with dogs but cats. (Two ginger toms, one fussy and one greedy, who tend to sleep on her laptop.) But she adds that Cruft himself “always dodged the question about what dog breed he had. After he died, his wife said, ‘We had cats!’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/16/a-dogs-tale-poppy-hollman-musical-crufts">Continue reading...</a>

• <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket/match/2020-01-16/england-cricket-team" title="">England 224 for four at stumps on first day of third Test</a><br />• Stokes unbeaten on 39 and Pope 38 not out overnight<p>This was a slow burner of a day – except for those spectators foolish enough to stay out of the shade as a fierce sun blazed out of a cloudless sky. The pitch was slow, the band was surprisingly slow to play their trademark “Stand By Me” and for much of the time the batting was slow, until Ollie Pope launched a mini-assault against the second new ball in front of an admiring Ben Stokes. Yet it would be foolish to conclude that in the 21st century it will stay as serene as this. Matches tend to accelerate on this ground. Despite a bland, innocuous-looking surface draws are now a rarity here.</p><p>When the players left the field England, after winning the toss, were 224 for four and, oddly enough, both sides could feel content with their efforts. The batsmen had battled away but only the best of them, which included Pope, could score with any freedom. None of them could post a half-century but the unbeaten partnership of 76 between Pope and Stokes in the final 90 minutes gave England the edge.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/16/south-africa-england-third-test-day-one-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Journalist who had a meteoric rise up the political ladder to become a minister in the government of Harold Wilson<p>The former Labour defence minister Lord Chalfont, who has died aged 100, had perhaps the most precipitous and unlikely rise to a political career in modern history. He was Alun Gwynne Jones, defence correspondent of the Times, at the time of the election of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries" title="">Harold Wilson</a>’s first Labour government in October 1964, and in a matter of days was summoned for an unexpected briefing with the prime minister at No 10, leaving a short time later as both a minister – for disarmament, based in the Foreign Office, not the Ministry of Defence – and a life peer.</p><p>“If the word had been invented I would have said I was gobsmacked,” Chalfont told the Independent in 1995. “I have never expressed any political views that could characterise me as left or right.” In that, over time, he advised all three main parties on defence issues, he was correct. Many, however, would query that assessment, as he later took increasingly authoritarian stands in support of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/apr/08/margaret-thatcher-political-phenomenon-dies" title="">Thatcher</a> government, which led to her recommending his appointment in 1989 as deputy chairman of the Independent Broadcasting Authority and in 1990 as chairman of the Radio Authority.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/16/lord-chalfont-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The film business used to run on hunches. Now, data analytics is far more effective than humans at predicting hits and eliminating flops. Is this a brave new world – or the death knell of creativity? <br /></p><p>If Sunspring is anything to go by, artificial intelligence in film-making has some way to go. This short film, made as an entry to Sci-Fi London’s 48-hour film-making competition in 2016, was written entirely by an AI. The director, Oscar Sharp, fed a few hundred sci-fi screenplays into a long short-term memory recurrent neural network (the type of software behind predictive text in a smartphone), then told it to write its own. The result was almost, but not quite, incoherent nonsense, riddled with cryptic nonsequiturs, bizarre turns of phrase and unfathomable stage directions such as “he is standing in the stars and sitting on the floor”. All of which Sharp and his actors filmed with sincere commitment.</p><p>“In a future with mass unemployment, young people are forced to sell blood,” says a man in a shiny gold jacket. “You should see the boy and shut up. I was the one who was going to be a hundred years old,” replies a woman fiddling with some electronics. The man vomits up an eyeball. A second man says: “Well, I have to go to the skull.” And so forth. An unwitting viewer might be unsure whether they were watching meaningless nonsense or a lost Tarkovsky script.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/16/its-a-war-between-technology-and-a-donkey-how-ai-is-shaking-up-hollywood">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Concussion can have lifelong consequences and children are particularly at risk</p><p>The death in 2002 of the former England and West Bromwich Albion striker Jeff Astle from degenerative brain disease placed the spotlight firmly on the possibility of a link between heading footballs and the risk of dementia. The coroner at the inquest ruled that Astle, 59, died from an “industrial disease” brought on by the repeated trauma of headers, and a later examination of Astle’s brain appeared to bear out this conclusion.</p><p>At that time there was sparse scientific data on the issue, but since then the balance of evidence has steadily tipped further in favour of a link.

<p><strong>Wilton’s Music Hall, London</strong><br />A transatlantic voyage in 1910, with the silent stars onboard, is the basis of Told By An Idiot’s beguiling comedy</p><p>Charlie Chaplin and Stan Laurel shared a boat from the UK to New York in 1910, as part of Fred Karno’s music hall troupe. Stan later understudied for Charlie – before they went their separate, and separately legendary, ways. Is that a “strange tale”? Not really – it’s just a scrap of biography, a fleeting association about which little is known. But in this silent comedy for the <a href="https://mimelondon.com/">London international mime festival</a>, Told By An Idiot mine it for beguiling oddity, as Chaplin, Laurel and Karno shuttle and pratfall around a transatlantic liner and episodes from their past and future vault into view like salmon from the sea.</p><p>The effect is less tale, more short stories. It is assembled with minimal rhyme and reason, but with the follow-its-nose logic (and illogic) to which the company’s fans – myself included – are well accustomed. Director Paul Hunter valued “fiction over fact [and] fantasy over reality”, the programme tells us – which explains the central sequence, in which Chaplin accidentally kills his underling with a frying pan and (after the obligatory manhandling-a-corpse slapstick sequence) hurls the hapless Lancastrian overboard.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/16/the-strange-tale-of-charlie-chaplin-and-stan-laurel-review-wiltons-music-hall-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Let’s hear it for mindless eating: for noise and clamour, for shouting and burping</p><p>Amid the blizzard of diet cobblers that fills my inbox at this time of year, generally promising to cleanse you of all evidence that you ever ate anything at all, is one email that made me roll my eyeballs with such intensity I’m sure the neighbours could hear the grinding of flesh. It proposes “mindful eating”. A few ill-advised clicks later and I land on a self-styled food guru’s manifesto. “Have you ever noticed,” it starts, “how incredibly silent it becomes at dinner as soon as the food hits the table? Then you may have experienced mindful eating.”</p><p>Honestly, no. Not in my house. And long may that continue. According to our nutritional adviser too many of us eat semi-consciously. We are careless. We give no consideration to taste and texture. We are bad to the core. Part of the solution, apparently, is silence. This, she suggests, will help us towards<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jun/14/the-mindfulness-conspiracy-capitalist-spirituality" title=""> mindful eating</a>.

Gender norms compound the trauma for men who are victims of rape and sexual abuse. It’s time to give them support<p>Callum Hancock was 10 years old when he was raped by a longstanding bully in a den in his back garden. “They made it sound like a game, they said it’s like smoking, something you do when you’re older, that if you tell your parents you’ll be in trouble.”</p><p>Speaking in a broad Sheffield accent, the well-built 28-year-old recalls having loving parents and a happy childhood – “plenty of holidays, lots of laughter” – punctured by trauma. Later, as puberty crept along and girls caught his eye, he wondered if the attack meant he was really gay. He started to ask himself if maybe he’d dreamed it: anything to suppress what had happened. He took up boxing because it “was my way of proving that I was a man, that I was going above and beyond to prove I was a man”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/16/male-rape-victims-sexual-abuse-support">Continue reading...</a>

They look quite silly without a pointy end, but they also call into question why this has never been done before – indeed, why kitchen knives evolved to be the shape they are. Because you never use the point, or maybe you do once every couple of years for a particularly slidey tomato. All regular chopping is done with the blade edge.</p><p>I shall not be buying a pointless knife but I thought I would take the opportunity to run through the top kitchen injuries of myself and everyone I know, so that younger readers can avoid them.

<p>Gene and Sandy Ralston are a married couple in their 70s, who also happen to be among North America’s leading experts at searching for the dead. By Doug Horner</p><p>When Gene and Sandy Ralston returned to their truck after a day on the Beardsley reservoir in northern California in March 2002, they discovered several handwritten notes taped to the doors and windscreen: “Call Lieutenant Lunney as soon as you get back to town. It’s urgent.”</p><p>The Ralstons, a married couple from rural Idaho, had been scientists until the late 1980s, when they began helping out on local search and rescue missions. By the winter of 2002, they had volunteered on more than a dozen searches for victims of drowning across the US, and had developed an uncanny ability to find bodies. They had just helped Lt Lunney’s sheriff’s department locate the remains of a man who had drowned in the reservoir three-and-a-half years earlier, after falling off his boat while fishing.

And in all those hours, in common with many of Peter’s Saturdays, not to mention his Sundays, he had no meaningful interaction with another human being. “The only person I spoke to,” he says, “was the lady who came over to verify my bottles of beer at the supermarket self-checkout.”</p><p>During the week, Peter, 62, is too busy to be lonely. His commute from Brighton to London means that his working life is “a tunnel” he enters on a Monday and from which no daylight is glimpsed until Friday. But just when Peter re-emerges, he is stymied by an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Instead of providing respite from the stress of office life, a chance to reconnect with family and friends, the weekend looms as a vast emotional and social wilderness that must be traversed before work takes hold again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/16/the-agony-of-weekend-loneliness-i-wont-speak-to-another-human-until-monday">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As an MP, Femke Halsema helped make prostitution legal in the Netherlands. So why does she now want to overhaul an area where sex workers famously ply their trade? </p><p>The local football team, Ajax, had just won the championship, and as is traditional, the mayor of Amsterdam expected some abuse at the victory parade. “It is a Dutch tradition – it is usually just screaming and throwing cans of beer,”said Femke Halsema, the first woman to take the highest office in the Dutch capital.</p><p>Halsema, 53, a former leader of the national Green party, though, faced a difference grade of barracking: shouts of “bitch” and “whore”, and a wall of middle fingers. “It was a moment when I was confronted by being a woman,” she said, laughing. “I think the last mayor wasn’t called a bitch.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/16/amsterdam-green-mayor-reform-red-light-district">Continue reading...</a>

<p>History is littered with stories of the psychoactive properties of <em>deli bal</em>, still produced today in the Kaçkar mountains</p><p>It is no surprise that a substance powerful enough to take out 1,000 battle-hardened mercenaries of the Roman republic has been the subject of fascination for millennia. Stories cataloguing the delights and the dangers of <em>deli bal</em>, or Turkish “mad honey”, crop up throughout history.<br /><br />Pompey the Great was admired and feared throughout the ancient world, but an early misadventure with mad honey near the modern-day Black Sea city of Trabzon almost derailed his entire career.<br /><br />The Roman general was pursuing the army of Mithridates VI in 97BC when in a stroke of military genius the Greco-Persian king ordered his troops to place bowls of the locally produced honey in the path of the advancing Romans. Three detachments of soldiers fell upon it, becoming delirious or fainting as they succumbed to its psychedelic effects. Mithridates’ troops returned to find Pompey’s men incapacitated and proceeded to slaughter the lot of them.<br /><br />Mad honey is still produced in small quantities by beekeepers in the Kaçkar mountains above the Black Sea, the only place in the world other than the foothills of the Himalayas where indigenous species of rhododendrons produce a potent neurotoxin called grayanotoxin. If bees feed on enough rhododendron nectar, the mud-red honey they produce has a sharp scent, bitter taste – and for human consumers, a potential high.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/16/creating-a-buzz-turkish-beekeepers-risk-life-and-limb-to-make-mad-honey">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour party has been narrowed to five candidates this week. Political editor Heather Stewart looks at the challenge ahead for the party as it faces five more years of opposition. Plus: John Abraham on the historic warming of the oceans </p><p>Labour MPs returned to Westminster minus 60 of their colleagues who lost their seats in last month’s election.
