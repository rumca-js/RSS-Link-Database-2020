## ‘Part-science lab, part-playground’: how kids made museums take fun seriously

<p>From London to California, architects are helping museums provide interactive learning experiences that can’t be found on screen</p><p>Last year, the Hoxton-based architecture practice <a href="http://www.theaoc.co.uk/" title="">AOC</a> set up the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/exhibitions/open-studio/" title="">Open Studio</a> at the <a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/" title="">V&amp;A</a><a href="https://www.vam.ac.uk/moc/" title=""> Museum of Childhood</a> in nearby Bethnal Green, east London. The 147-year-old institution was set to be renovated and initial consultation of local schoolchildren had found that they wanted the space turned into the “most joyful museum in the world”. AOC set up the Open Studio to find out how this could be done. It was a test-lab of forums and workshops for children and families, a space where visitors were encouraged to hold objects from the V&amp;A’s collection and answer questions such as: “What is a museum?”</p><p>Geoff Shearcroft, who is co-founding director of AOC and led the Open Studio, said consensus among children was that a museum is “a place for collecting and looking at objects”. But they also thought the top attractions at the Museum of Childhood were “playing on the rocking horse, the sandpit, running up and down the ramp and having an ice cream”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/19/museum-science-lab-playground-children-fun-architects">Continue reading...</a>

## Neneh Cherry: ‘Rap is a kind of freedom’

<p>Thirty years after her debut, the singer recalls how hip-hop broke the mould for British women - and we chart the rappers that followed in her path, from Cookie Crew to Cassie Rytz</p><p>One of BBC Four’s recent <em>Top of the Pops</em> reruns from the late 1980s<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m000d26k/top-of-the-pops-05011989" title=""> features a performance </a>that many of us who were young girls at the time vividly remember. It was the debut in 1988 of an exhilarating, in-your-face artist, slotted between the soft seasonal balms of Freiheit’s Keeping the Dream Alive and Kylie and Jason’s Especially for You. She was 24, visibly pregnant, dancing in a gold bra, gold jacket and huge medallion, and doing something else that felt revolutionary: rapping.</p><p>The next day, our school playground filled with little girls delivering words into one another’s faces that they didn’t quite understand, trying to get the rhythms right. It didn’t matter: Neneh Cherry’s Buffalo Stance, and its attitude, had entered our world. Cherry was by no means the first female rapper with a distinctly British style – there had been several female duos and groups before her – but that uncompromising, joyous, performance can be seen now as the moment mainstream pop opened up to artists like her, and laid the groundwork for the next three decades of solo female MCs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/19/neneh-cherry-rap-is-a-kind-of-freedom-women-in-hip-hop">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Bella Mackie began posting about her struggles with anxiety, she unexpectedly found herself becoming an influencer. But what did sharing her private fears teach her?</p><p>“Bella, I know it’s not the point, but where is your jumper from?” This was a reply to a post I put up on Instagram about the horrors of antidepressant withdrawal. I respond with the details, mildly flattered, but slightly despairing. After decades of not talking about my mental health issues, I started an Instagram account (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/mackie_bella/?hl=en" title="">@mackie_bella</a>) hoping to talk more honestly about them, but maybe when everyone has their own struggles they don’t want to be burdened with yours. Why would you want to watch someone else moan on the morning commute when you could gaze at a lovely fluffy jumper to cheer yourself up? I would choose the jumper myself most days.</p><p>I have become somewhat well followed on Instagram at a time when the platform is being hugely criticised. Social media influencers are widely scorned for showing off unattainable lifestyles, promoting irresponsible products, such as slimming teas, and being disingenuous about what’s real and what’s staged for effect. Websites have sprung up where those who are fed up with the polished images can call them out, sometimes brutally.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/19/confessions-of-an-accidental-influencer-bella-mackie-instagram-mental-health-awareness">Continue reading...</a>

The best they might have managed is that it lay up north in that mysterious and unknown area of the country that they had mentally marked: “Here Be Dragons”. Now a Conservative MP sits for the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/theyre-getting-their-just-desserts-how-traditional-voters-ditched-labour" title="">Northumbrian constituency,</a> which has never previously been represented by the Tories.

It is a striking fact that they of Conservative MPs account for half of the backbenchers sitting behind Boris Johnson. His new friends from the north speak in different accents to their more southerly colleagues. They often think differently as well. And they represent areas of the country with needs and concerns that have been alien to the Tory party over many decades. <a href="https://www.harboroughmail.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-neil-obrien-re-elected-harborough-1340200" title="">Neil O’Brien</a>, the Conservative MP for Harborough, points out that Tories represented just 14 seats in the most deprived half of England in 2001.

This could give them a lot of clout if they get organised. There are signs that they are.

<p><strong>David Zwirner, London</strong><br />Posthumous celebrations of two undervalued but extraordinary 20th-century artists give them both the recognition they deserve</p><p>It hardly seems possible that there could be a major 20th-century artist still ripe for rediscovery, but so it seems with the Japanese-American sculptor <strong><a href="https://ruthasawa.com/art/sculpture/" title="">Ruth Asawa</a> </strong>(1926-2013). Her work comes as a complete surprise, and not only because she has never been shown in this country before. Everything Asawa made was so original, and fashioned mainly out of wire – an art of pure visual joy.</p><p>Born in rural California, Asawa’s first exposure to art teaching came when her family and other Japanese-Americans were detained in internment camps during the second world war. After hostilities ended, she studied art at the famously experimental and non-hierarchical Black Mountain College in North Carolina. She began with ink drawing, both figurative and abstract. But in 1947, a Mexican craftsman taught Asawa how to weave baskets out of wire, and this knowledge inspired her own unique structures.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/19/ruth-asawa-a-line-can-go-anywhere-review-benode-behari-mukherjee-after-sight-david-zwirner-london">Continue reading...</a>

Sitting beside me, <a href="https://twitter.com/joshtetrick" title="">the company’s CEO Josh Tetrick</a> tries to put my moral dilemma into perspective. “You’re not my target market,” he says. “It’s people who are eating meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner.”</p><p>The product in the fryer is JUST’s prototype chicken nugget, which costs about $50 to make. It is manufactured from what the industry calls cultured, cell-based or cultivated meat (though the outside world knows it more commonly as lab-grown meat). Not to be confused with “meat” that is plant derived, it is produced directly from animal cells with little need to raise and no need to slaughter actual animals. It is a technology with the potential to fundamentally change the world – significantly replacing the way meat is produced now with a kinder and less environmentally damaging alternative.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/19/cultured-meat-on-its-way-to-a-table-near-you-cultivated-cells-farming-society-ethics">Continue reading...</a>

All eminently reasonable and not very remarkable.</p><p>But there is, of course, the second level: they’re inescapably royal. This is hardly the abdication: the constitutional ramifications of the sixth in line bailing out to a new life in Canada are not earth-shattering.

The barman pointed to another sign. “We don’t take cards, only cash. If you go up the high street, you can find a cashpoint.” As I left for a second time to get some money, I thought I caught the trace of a smirk on a fellow drinker’s face as they gazed impassively into the middle distance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/19/tranquility-returns-as-samuel-smith-pub-bans-mobiles">Continue reading...</a>

Labour’s caricature of the new PM as pro-Trump and anti-interventionist has been surprisingly wide of the mark<p>It was only on general election day – 1 May 1997 – that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJpyks_lPhQ" title="">Tony Blair</a> began to focus on what he would actually do in government if he won. He left it until all the campaigning was over to ask to see a detailed plan for the first 100 days that David Miliband, then his head of policy, and Jonathan Powell, his chief of staff, had spent much of the previous months devising. Until then, despite being miles ahead in the polls, “Blair hadn’t wanted to look”, Powell says.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/18/boris-johnson-warns-cabinet-shape-up-or-be-sacked">Johnson to cabinet: shape up or I’ll sack you within weeks</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/19/boris-johnson-liberal-nuanced-cautious">Continue reading...</a>

<p>To try to combat the mountain of food waste, diabetic Andrew Mayers decided to live on what people chuck in the bin. Even if it’s two doughnuts and a cucumber</p><p>My NHS dietician says that January is a dangerous month for diabetics such as me. The shops are full of Christmas leftovers: those high-calorie, nutrient-light foodstuffs, now for sale at massive discounts – confectionery collections, deep-filled mince pies, presentation tins of chocolate biscuits. You exert all that willpower over the festive period, and just when you think it’s safe to go back into the supermarkets …</p><p>But in the last year I’ve pretty much stopped going into supermarkets.

<p>No woman has raced in a Formula 1 grand prix since the 1970s. Does the 21-year-old Williams driver have the talent and ambition to change all that?</p><p>Even if you’re one of the most promising young racing drivers of your era, you still have to take your driving test. Shortly after she turned 17, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/10/w-series-jamie-chadwick-f1-brands-hatch-motor-sport" title="">Jamie Chadwick</a> thought she’d better get on with it. She had been driving competitively since she first raced a go-kart, when she was 11. “Obviously I knew how to drive a car,” she says. “But driving on roads, knowing everything about road driving, is very different.” She’d planned to have lessons, but only managed “sort of one and a half” before a cancellation meant she had a chance to take the test. “I was, like, I’ll just do it and if I fail, I might never live it down, but I just have to give it a go.” To her great relief, she passed. “<em>Somehow</em>. But I was never taught to park, so I still can’t. Then I found myself as designated driver and I was, like, this isn’t worth it either.” She laughs. “So a lot of regret in that whole situation.”</p><p>Chadwick might not be able to park, but in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/formulaone" title="">Formula 1</a>, she’s not going to need to. If all goes to plan, that is exactly where she’ll end up, breaking a 43-year dry spell for women on the starting grid. Last year, she won the inaugural <a href="https://wseries.com/" title="">W Series</a>, an all-female championship that ended at Brands Hatch in August. She is gathering firsts at quite a rate: at 17, she was the first woman and youngest driver to win the <a href="https://www.britishgt.com/" title="">British GT Championship</a>. In 2018, she became the first woman to win a British F3 race. Last February, she became the first female winner of the <a href="https://www.mrfracing.in/racing" title="">MRF Challenge</a> series in Chennai. She is competing now in the <a href="http://www.f3asia.com/" title="">Asian F3 Championship</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/19/this-is-my-adrenaline-fix-jamie-chadwick-f1-first-female-hope-in-43-years">Continue reading...</a>

Laurence Fox’s anti-PC stance on Question Time has tapped into a disturbing trend<p>Memo to those who’ve been raucously applauding actor Laurence Fox’s “anti-PC” outburst on <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/uk-51145321/actor-laurence-fox-s-question-time-clash-over-meghan-markle" title=""><em>Question Time</em></a>. No, Fox wasn’t “brave” or “refreshing” in dismissing the racism aimed at Meghan Markle. When a mixed-race university lecturer in the audience pointed out that he was speaking as a white privileged male, Fox embarrassed himself by retorting: “I was born like this… So to call me a white privileged male is to be racist – <em>you’re</em> being racist.” Later, he was on Twitter, quoting Martin Luther King. Seriously, Mr Fox, there’s this thing called self-awareness. Why not try it? It may not be quite as painful as you fear. However, he was right to say: “The tide is turning.” This tense sociocultural moment wasn’t just about “white privilege”, it also signalled a new dawn for woke-bashing.</p><p>White privilege is complex, but that doesn’t make it any less real. Who has it? <em>All</em> white people perhaps, in certain circumstances, just to varying degrees. So not so much poor white schoolboys with socioeconomic odds stacked against them, or other disadvantaged white groups, but people such as Fox must realise they spend their lives splashing in the stuff. It’s almost fascinating: why are some people (even erudite types such as Fox) so blind to their own advantages – even bizarrely laying claim to victimhood, with all that “I can’t help being born this way” codswallop? This race flip wilfully ignores the power structures, barriers and more that people of colour have to deal with every day. But hey, when did boring old logic ever allow people to let rip?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/19/plain-speaking-culture-war-has-potential-to-turn-poisonous">Continue reading...</a>

In Santander some Racing fans still cling to the old, fading T-shirt that celebrated their 5-0 victory over the Dream Team in February 1995 like some religious relic.

A moment’s inattention at a La Scala premiere made just the shot the pioneering photojournalist needed<p>Alfred Eisenstaedt, the prime mover of candid photojournalism, took this picture at the La Scala opera house in 1933. Eisenstaedt was experimenting with a new Leica camera that allowed him to do away with much of the clunky paraphernalia of his craft. That night, at the gala premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov’s <em>The Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh</em>, he was looking for a way to find some intimacy among the theatre’s grand architectural curves.</p><p>Scanning the boxes in the upper tiers of the opera house he saw a young woman whose attention to the progress of the Russian epic on stage did not seem absolute. Better still, the box next to her was empty. Eisenstaedt was an unobtrusive man, only 5ft, and he inveigled his way into the empty box and got his shot. “Without the girl there would have been no picture,” he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/19/big-picture-alfred-eisenstadt-opera-premiere-la-scala">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our once-binary world is loosening its shackles, says Mariella Frostrup. Be inquisitive but don’t feel pressured to define yourself yet</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong></em>I’m a 16-year-old girl and in need of advice concerning sexuality. I’ve only been questioning it since I was 15, and I frantically search the internet for answers all the time, even though I know it’s not that simple (especially for someone as young as me who has had little experience with relationships). For a while I’ve settled on the term “bisexual”, because I know I’m not straight, but even that doesn’t feel right. I’m physically attracted to boys, but I’ve only had one real crush and that was four years ago. I’m definitely physically attracted to girls, too, although some days I’m not into it as much, and other days I’ll be all for it. This might lead you to think that bisexual is a good label for me to stick with, but I’ve never had a proper crush on a girl, and I don’t know if I could be romantically attracted. I know it sounds pretty silly and that I have time to figure out who I am and what I like, but I’m anxious all the time over it.</p><p><em><strong>Mariella replies </strong></em>Thanks for writing. I’m sorry, but not surprised, to hear that you’re feeling confused. As our once-binary world loosens its shackles on our sexuality it sometimes seems to be piling up almost as much pressure as it relieves. With so many choices and tribes to consider, it must be positively baffling to be a teenager awakening to the myriad paths before you. I’m not suggesting we revert to the landscape of my teenage years when, as a girl, even admitting to sexual desire marked you down as a bad ’un, but with so many options, how are you to make your selection? And how much do you want to get bogged down in the “research”?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/19/i-fancy-boys-and-girls-but-dont-know-what-that-makes-me-mariella-frostrup">Continue reading...</a>

## Richard Layard: ‘It's in politicians' self-interest to make policies for happiness’

<p>The economist on the science of happiness – and how it can help us rethink the world<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/19/why-world-needs-new-politics-happiness-can-we-be-happier-evidence-and-ethics-richard-layard">• Read an extract from Richard Layard’s Can We Be Happier?</a></p><p><strong>Is happiness, which we think of as fleeting, a realistic state to which to aspire?</strong><br />I think happiness is what people most care about. They want to know how happy their child is. They want to know whether they’re happy in their work, they want to know whether they’re happy in their marriages. It’s not that it’s happiness or nothing. It’s somewhere on the scale. And we want to be higher up the scale. We want everybody to be higher up the scale and that’s to my mind the definition of a good society.</p><p><strong>You write in the book about the attempted suicide</strong><strong> by your father (the distinguished psychoanalyst John Layard) before he met your mother. How formative was that knowledge in your young life?</strong><br />Well, I was aware of it because I used to feel the dent in his head where the bullet had lodged but it wasn’t what made me think about people’s unhappiness. What did interest me in mental health was not my father but his patients and the fact that my father was able to help them. That I think was where my interest in mental health came from rather than from any kind of angst.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/19/richard-layard-everybody-could-have-a-better-time-extract-from-can-we-be-happier">Continue reading...</a>
