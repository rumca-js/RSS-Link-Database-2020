I had booked time there but I realized I didn't know what that meant and I couldn't find anyone I had talked to. So I hunkered down on the MC-101 and tried it out.

It's a 3 oscillator mono/paraphonic with a wavetable oscillator, multi-mode filter, awesome motion sequencer, great effects, and some other cool bells and whistles. \n\nI put my hands on one for the first time at NAMM 2020. This is that footage.\n\nI didn't expect to love this thing as much as I did. It's got an incredibly unique sound, huge and techy, grungy and distorted, sharp and round. \n\nPlease, papa Dave, notice me.\n------------------------------------\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\nT-Shirts: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxj0q6hQu0M", "date_published": "2020-01-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ", "title": "Sonicware LIVEN Chiptune Groovebox Intro and Demo", "description": "The Sonicware LIVEN is a super unique little chiptuney synthesizer with a robust sequencer and internal resampling.

It feels like it wants to and could be a modern Virus TI but this was the synth I struggled most with in terms  of interface and tweaking. There are some really important controls not on the front panel and I didn't like the menu system. \n\nI think there's a very powerful synth under the hood here, but I didn't enjoy playing it that much. \n------------------------------------\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\nT-Shirts: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFhvQGmZDIE", "date_published": "2020-01-20 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ", "title": "Surfing The Korg Wavestate at NAMM 2020", "description": "I touched a Korg Wavestate for the first time at NAMM 2020.
