I\u2019ve only been questioning it since I was 15, and I frantically search the internet for answers all the time, even though I know it\u2019s not that simple (especially for someone as young as me who has had little experience with relationships). For a while I\u2019ve settled on the term \u201cbisexual\u201d, because I know I\u2019m not straight, but even that doesn\u2019t feel right. I\u2019m physically attracted to boys, but I\u2019ve only had one real crush and that was four years ago. I\u2019m definitely physically attracted to girls, too, although some days I\u2019m not into it as much, and other days I\u2019ll be all for it. This might lead you to think that bisexual is a good label for me to stick with, but I\u2019ve never had a proper crush on a girl, and I don\u2019t know if I could be romantically attracted. I know it sounds pretty silly and that I have time to figure out who I am and what I like, but I\u2019m anxious all the time over it.</p><p><em><strong>Mariella replies </strong></em>Thanks for writing. I\u2019m sorry, but not surprised, to hear that you\u2019re feeling confused. As our once-binary world loosens its shackles on our sexuality it sometimes seems to be piling up almost as much pressure as it relieves. With so many choices and tribes to consider, it must be positively baffling to be a teenager awakening to the myriad paths before you. I\u2019m not suggesting we revert to the landscape of my teenage years when, as a girl, even admitting to sexual desire marked you down as a bad \u2019un, but with so many options, how are you to make your selection? And how much do you want to get bogged down in the \u201cresearch\u201d?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/19/i-fancy-boys-and-girls-but-dont-know-what-that-makes-me-mariella-frostrup\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/19/i-fancy-boys-and-girls-but-dont-know-what-that-makes-me-mariella-frostrup", "date_published": "2020-01-19 06:00:49+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Conor McGregor destroys Donald Cerrone in 40 seconds on UFC return", "description": "<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/18/ufc-246-conor-mcgregor-v-donald-cerrone-live\">McGregor scores first-round TKO at UFC 246 \u2013 as it happened</a></li><li>Former two-division champion returns from inactive stretch </li></ul><p>Conor McGregor came back with a big bang.</p><p>McGregor stopped Donald Cerrone with a head kick and punches 40 seconds into the first round at UFC 246 on Saturday night, announcing his return to mixed martial arts with his first victory since 2016.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/19/conor-mcgregor-donald-cerrone-fight-ufc-246\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/19/conor-mcgregor-donald-cerrone-fight-ufc-246", "date_published": "2020-01-19 05:58:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Richard Layard: \u2018It's in politicians' self-interest to make policies for happiness\u2019", "description": "<p>The economist on the science of happiness \u2013 and how it can help us rethink the world<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/19/why-world-needs-new-politics-happiness-can-we-be-happier-evidence-and-ethics-richard-layard\">\u2022 Read an extract from Richard Layard\u2019s Can We Be Happier?</a></p><p><strong>Is happiness, which we think of as fleeting, a realistic state to which to aspire?</strong><br />I think happiness is what people most care about.
