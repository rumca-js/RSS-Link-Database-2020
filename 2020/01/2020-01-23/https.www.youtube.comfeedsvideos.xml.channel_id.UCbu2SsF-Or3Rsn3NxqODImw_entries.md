During a Devstream, Respawn announced the first official details for Apex Legends Season 4: Assimilation. The upcoming season introduces several notable changes to how Ranked will work and also adds new content.

In the video above, Tamoor Hussain details the most noteworthy announcements from the Devstream. Season 4: Assimilation introduces a new playable character, Forge, and weapon, the Sentinel. The new season will also see the return of fan-favorite Kings Canyon, Apex Legends' original map, but World's Edge isn't going anywhere anytime soon--Season 4 will have opportunities for you to play on both maps. 

Though there are numerous changes to Ranked Mode in Season 4, the one that you need to know about only concerns high-tier play. The Apex Predator rank will be renamed Master in Season 4, while the title of Apex Predator will only be given to the highest ranking players in the world. Only those in the top 500 for each system (Xbox One, PS4, and PC) will be able to hold the title of Apex Predator.

Season 4: Assimilation is scheduled to begin on February 4. If you want more detailed breakouts on all the information discussed in the video, check out our roundup of everything that was announced during the Season 4 Reveal Devstream.
