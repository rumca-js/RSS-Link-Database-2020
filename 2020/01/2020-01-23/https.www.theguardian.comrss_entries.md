<p>There are many ways apprentices can bring real value to your company. Here, business leaders advise on the best ways to help apprentices thrive</p><p>Enthusiasm, skills and commitment – these are just a few of the qualities apprentices bring to the workplace. Whether you want to upskill or retrain current employees, or take on a new member of staff, there are big benefits in taking on an apprentice. We spoke to managers who run apprenticeship programmes for some of the biggest companies in the country to find out how they help apprentices achieve their full potential – and the benefits they bring in return.</p><p><strong>Start with the end in mind<br /></strong>Before you get going, it’s a good idea to consider what your business objectives are, how apprentices can meet your skills needs and where you need to add value. Are you aiming to increase revenue, attract new customers, develop new products, reduce waste or improve customer service? Apprenticeships should be planned to boost your human resources and help you to increase your productivity. “You need to think about what business projects you can get them involved with when you design the programme,” says Kathryn Marshall, who leads on apprenticeships at Lloyds Bank. Select the job roles that will make the biggest difference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fire-up-your-future/2020/jan/23/we-love-the-energy-that-apprentices-bring-to-our-business-top-tips-for-employing-an-apprentice">Continue reading...</a>
