Editor-in-chief Kyle Mann and creative director Ethan Nicolle welcome special guest McGill Alexander, a former South African Army officer, who was on assignment in Taiwan as South Africa’s military attaché when a notorious murderer and rapist broke into his home and held his family hostage at gunpoint for 26 hours. McGill and his daughter were both shot but survived. McGill and his wife forgave their captor, gave him a Bible, and led him to Christ. Kyle, Ethan, and McGill talk about what it means to love your enemies as Jesus taught us to do.

 You can read McGill’s account in his book  Hostage in Taipei : A True Story of Forgiveness and Hope.

 A re-enactment of McGill’s story was broadcast by National Geographic Channel in their  Locked Up Abroad series of docudramas (2008). You have to purchase the episode so make sure you are viewing Season 1, Ep. 10: "Taiwan".
