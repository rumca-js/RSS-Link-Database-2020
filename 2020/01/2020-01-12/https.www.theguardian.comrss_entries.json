The sergeant replied without hesitation \u201cCwmcarn\u201d, a mining village in the Ebbw Valley. On that first visit, Davidson underestimated how long it would take to get to Cwmcarn and had to leave before he could take any pictures, to avoid being awol. But in a couple of hours, he was able to take in a sense of \u201cthe coal dust and the flesh, of the sweat and the danger\u201d of the miners\u2019 lives. \u201cThere was something beautiful about a life that was so horrible,\u201d he has said.</p><p>It was another nine years before Davidson returned to Cwmcarn, by which time he had become famous for his revolutionary images of American subcultures and gangs, and for his indelible up-close images from the frontlines of the civil rights movement. He hadn\u2019t forgotten Cwmcarn, however, and finding himself in Wales on a magazine assignment to photograph Caernarfon Castle, he made his way back there.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/12/big-picture-fresh-faced-innocence-in-cwamcarn-bruce-davidson\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/12/big-picture-fresh-faced-innocence-in-cwamcarn-bruce-davidson", "date_published": "2020-01-12 07:00:29+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018The Godfather of trains\u2019: the Trans-Mongolian from Moscow to Beijing", "description": "<p>For the author of<em> </em>Around the World in 80 Trains this was a standout journey, full of captivating encounters that could only happen on a train</p><p>With the air of melodrama unique to chic French women, the lady opposite me yanked open the overhead window then sat back down, grumbling to no one in particular and fanning herself with a copy of Paris Match.
