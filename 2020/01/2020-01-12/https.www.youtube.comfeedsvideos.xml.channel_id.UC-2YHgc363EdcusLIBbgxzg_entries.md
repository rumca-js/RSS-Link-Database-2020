The search for exoplanets is an effort to understand our place in the universe. How special are we? Is there another Earth out there? Are there other versions of us?

TESS, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, is currently surveying the entire sky to get us closer to the answer. It's an exoplanet hunter unlike any other, and it could change the way we see ourselves.

Special thanks to Dr. Sara Seagar for her help in researching this video.
