(Memphis Industries)<p>A concept album viewing the last century through the filter of the first world war, <a href="http://field-music.co.uk/" title="">Field Music</a>’s seventh album was initially composed and performed by Peter and David Brewis <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/06/field-music-gigs-first-world-war-ended-sound-ranging-guns-silent" title="">for the Imperial War Museum</a> early last year. Each of its 19 tracks reflects on a different consequence of the great war, whether in the form of societal change (council housing; female suffrage) or technological advances (in foetal medicine; the invention of sanitary towels).</p><p>Such is the ambitious scope of the concept, however, that the individual songs can seem like an afterthought, eclipsed by the weight of all that they’re trying to say. I Thought You Were Something Else, for example, is a perfectly pleasant minute of instrumental loungey jazz that purports to be about a breakthrough in epidemiology in the wake of the 1919 flu pandemic, but could just as plausibly be about Aston Villa’s 1982 European Cup triumph.

<p>A middle-class French family is terrorised by the nanny from hell in this contrived drama</p><p>When Myriam (Leïla Bekhti) and her husband, Paul (Antoine Reinartz), employ the unflappable and serene Louise (Karin Viard) as the new nanny for their two children, they don’t anticipate how essential she will become to the smooth running of the household. And for her part, Louise embraces her status as honorary family member a little too eagerly. But while Louise is not all she seems, she’s not well written enough as a character to register as anything more than a string of button-pushing plot devices.</p><p>This is crass and exploitative stuff that feels too contrived – despite the child peril, lingering shots of knives and the increasingly demented behaviour of Louise – to build much in the way of real tension. Viard does her best, but the credibility of the picture, as well as that of her character, is undermined somewhat by her frenzied attack against an imaginary octopus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/12/lullaby-review-french-nanny-from-hell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Séamas O’Reilly embarked on a mission to change himself from ‘slob’ to ‘fitter slob’, he was hoping to lose some fat and find some muscle. But he ended up transforming himself in more ways than he could have guessed</p><p>Sarah Lindsay recites numbers as she pinches my folds. She does this under her breath, the way a dentist uses that odd numerical language to gossip about your molars right in front of you. “Chin 11.8, Mid aux 22, Supra 45.” I shudder from the touch of cold callipers on my skin as this last measurement is taken from my suprailiac area. Closer acquaintances would, I suppose, call them my love handles, but Sarah is good enough to keep things mildly formal, perhaps to offset the fact that she is measuring the fat on my body just a few minutes into our first meeting. I am standing in her office at <a href="https://roar-fitness.com/" title="">R</a><a href="https://roar-fitness.com/" title="">oar Fitness</a>, and my initial consultation is under way. It is Day 0 of my physical transformation plan and, following a brief chat, my top is off and it’s straight to the skin folds. This term itself is not ideal. Skin folds. It’s standard anatomical parlance, but it conjures images of oversized wildlife – hippos hoist into the air so the zoo can wash their meaty shanks. I am, of course, making these connections because I am staring in the mirror as all this is being done and noticing, perhaps for the first time, how much my body has changed in the past couple of years.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/nov/13/harry-hill-kidz-show-how-to-be-funny-for-kids" title="">Harry Hill</a> says he knew he was going bald when it started taking longer and longer to wash his face. I first noticed I was gaining weight when I started having to reach a little further to wash my sides in the shower. That and realising, around the time my son was six months old, that his adorable little pot belly and my own seemed to bear a family resemblance. If I’m being honest, my body’s journey from lad bod to dad bod preceded fatherhood. I spent my youth as that skinny, lanky child who never put on any weight. But with advancing age came lower metabolism, and a move away from retail and minimum wage jobs that kept me on my feet all day, to more settled and sedentary creative pursuits that see me now, aged 34, heartier than I once was.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/12/body-transformation-from-dad-bod-to-rad-bod-in-just-seven-weeks">Continue reading...</a>

As one survivor, now aged 90, prepares to commemorate the date, she explains why the Holocaust must never be forgotten … especially in an age of rising antisemitism and nationalism<p>Renee Salt had just turned 15 when she arrived at the gates of hell. Her journey with her parents to Auschwitz, the Nazi death camp near Kraków in Poland, was by cattle truck, wedged in with hundreds of other Jews, no food, water or air for 24 hours. On arrival, the men were separated from women and children; Renee, who was born in Poland, never saw her father again.</p><p>She and her mother stood in line. The “Angel of Death” – Nazi SS officer Josef Mengele, a doctor who conducted cruel experiments on prisoners – stood at the head of the queue. “Whenever he saw two people holding hands he would split them up with a flick of his hand, one to die and one to live,” she told the <em>Observer</em>. Those sent to the right were taken straight to the gas chambers. By a miracle – “God’s will, I suppose” – Renee and her mother both went to the left.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/auschwitz-gates-hell-75-years-on">Continue reading...</a>

But at what price?</p><p>In the HBO series that role is taken by the beautifully cast Kieran Culkin (brother of Macauley), whose billion-dollar prison is established in the opening scenes. After a short period of estrangement, he has returned to visit the penthouse offices of the global family media empire.

In what appears to be a single continuous shot, the camera tracks a masked figure through crowded streets, into a hotel lobby, up an elevator, out of a window, and over the rooftops to a deadly assignation. It’s an audacious, attention-grabbing curtain-raiser widely hailed as the film’s strongest asset.</p><p>For his latest movie – an awards-garlanded first world war drama that has already won <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/golden-globes-2020-1917-and-fleabag-lead-british-invasion-with-major-wins" title="">best picture honours at the Golden Globes</a> – Mendes has returned to the lure of the “one-shot” format, this time stretching it out to feature length.

The result is a populist, immersive drama that leads the viewer through the trenches and battlefields of northern France, as two young British soldiers attempt to make their way through enemy lines on 6 April 1917.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/12/1917-review-sam-mendes-first-world-war-ww1-unblinking-vision-one-shot">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bruce Davidson’s photograph of a child pushing a pram in a mining village captures a moment of peace amid the noise and grime</p><p>When he was serving in the US Signal Corps in 1956, the celebrated photographer Bruce Davidson was posted to Paris. He served there under a sergeant who was Welsh. Davidson was due three days’ leave and he asked the sergeant where on earth he would send his own worst enemy. The sergeant replied without hesitation “Cwmcarn”, a mining village in the Ebbw Valley. On that first visit, Davidson underestimated how long it would take to get to Cwmcarn and had to leave before he could take any pictures, to avoid being awol. But in a couple of hours, he was able to take in a sense of “the coal dust and the flesh, of the sweat and the danger” of the miners’ lives. “There was something beautiful about a life that was so horrible,” he has said.</p><p>It was another nine years before Davidson returned to Cwmcarn, by which time he had become famous for his revolutionary images of American subcultures and gangs, and for his indelible up-close images from the frontlines of the civil rights movement. He hadn’t forgotten Cwmcarn, however, and finding himself in Wales on a magazine assignment to photograph Caernarfon Castle, he made his way back there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/12/big-picture-fresh-faced-innocence-in-cwamcarn-bruce-davidson">Continue reading...</a>

Edging up to the window, I looked down to where a curl of sand and green water had appeared, an oasis where children bobbed about in dinghies and leapt off limestone rocks.

On arrival, she discovered that she had racked up charges of £1,095, twice the price of the transatlantic fare. “I had not used it to make or receive calls and when I opened it after landing there was no mention of any charges,” she says.</p><p>Haines is one of dozens of air and sea passengers who have received shock bills after their phones connected automatically to a satellite roaming network. While EU rules cap roaming fees outside Europe at €50, the legislation does not apply to satellite networks on planes and boats, which charge premium rates for data, wanted or not, unless customers actively switch off data roaming.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/12/mobile-phone-air-sea-charges-satellite-roaming">Continue reading...</a>

He defied a life of poverty and hardship to reach Oxford and become a barrister. Now Hashi Mohamed has written a book which aims to rethink the stalled project of social mobility<br /><br /><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/12/social-mobility-people-like-us-hashi-mohamed-refugee-barrister" title="">• Read an extract from Hashi Mohamed’s People Like Us</a><p><a href="https://www.no5.com/people/barristers/hashi-mohamed/planning-and-environment/" title="">Hashi Mohamed</a> is a 36-year-old barrister. He has the accent, a mentor once told of him, of someone who’s “been to Eton” and the confidence of a natural orator. If you had to place him within the complex matrix of the British class system, you’d probably say he was the son of wealthy Africans who attended an independent school and Oxbridge.</p><p>In fact, Mohamed is a Somali who was born in Kenya, where he lived in a rundown part of Nairobi with his four siblings (another having died), his mother (who also had six children from a previous marriage) and his travelling salesman father. When his father died in a car accident in 1993, Mohamed and three of his siblings were sent to England as refugees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/12/hashi-mohamed-child-refugee-barrister-people-like-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The owner of Brat on coastal trips and seafood tips</p><p><strong>Do you work? </strong>At <a href="https://www.bratrestaurant.com/" title="">Brat</a> we’re open seven days a week – so it’s rota dependent. I like the feel of the restaurant on Sundays, though. We have an open kitchen so I soak up the vibe while I’m cooking. We tend to have lots of families sitting together on long tables, so even if I’m not with my wife and son I feel I’m part of someone else’s.</p><p><strong>The perfect day off?</strong> I can’t stand brunch, it’s far too stressful. It’s poached eggs for me every morning. Days revolve around my son. We’ll walk around Hackney. No roast or pints, but sparkling wine and seafood. It’s nice bumping into other chefs on days off - you’re part of a community.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/12/sunday-with-tomos-parry-the-smell-of-seafood-shacks-reminds-me-of-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Serving game the chef has shot himself, this Newcastle joint is bang on target</p><p><strong>Bistro 46, 46 Brentwood Avenue, Newcastle NE2 3DH (0191 281 8081). Starters £6.95-£8.95, mains £15.95-£24.95, desserts £5.95-£7.95, wines from £18.50</strong></p><p>Max Gott always bags his target, at least eventually. For the table, it’s the pheasants, partridge and deer he shoots then serves at his compact bistro on a suburban shopping parade in Newcastle. In this case, it’s also me. When I looked back through my inbox, I found at least half a dozen frothing email threads initiated by Max over two years. Please, chefs, don’t be like Max. Don’t inundate me with needy messages. Just send me a simple, cleanly written menu, which is short on adjectives and big on intent. Leave it at that. Max only got away with sending me all the additional messages because of a certain self-deprecating charm. He kept apologising while also not shutting up, which is a neat trick if you can pull it off.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/12/bistro-46-newcastle-a-small-restaurant-with-heart-game">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This man has made it clear he doesn’t want a romantic relationship with you, says Mariella Frostrup. So find out your financial rights and focus on the baby</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>I am a 30-year-old woman and I’ve always wanted to settle down. Last spring I met a man with a previous marriage and a child. We were a good match, but without warning, after a few lovely months, he ended it. I took it badly and then all hell broke loose when I realised I was pregnant. I told him and we decided to keep the baby. I now see him a few times a week and we’ve bought a house, but we argue about him not prioritising time to build our relationship.</em></p><p><em>While he’s often kind and thoughtful, he also seems detached and unloving, resenting any extra demands I make. We don’t feel like a team and he openly admits he doesn’t love me, although he believes in time this might change. As the pregnancy progresses I feel constantly ill with worry and heartbreak, and my insecurities are bubbling over. I used to be confident with a good sense of self worth. When</em><em> I try to talk to him it usually ends in a horrible </em><em>argument with him cold and angry and me hysterical. </em><em>Should I try to swallow my pride and persevere – or </em><em>to build a stable foundation myself from the beginning?</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/12/i-am-having-a-baby-with-my-ex-but-long-for-us-to-be-a-family-mariella-frostrup">Continue reading...</a>
