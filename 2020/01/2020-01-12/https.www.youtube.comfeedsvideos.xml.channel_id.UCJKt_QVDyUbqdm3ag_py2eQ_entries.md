"The Tuneful Eight" (2019) by LMan (Markus Klein). Graphics by Joe. This upload is intended for headphones.

A special tune that uses 8 x 8580 SID chips, all emulated via Ultimate64 Elite UltiSIDs in this case. I did load the cfg file included with the demo, but i changed couple of values in the audio mixer to get full channel separation (works well when using Dolbyfied). Plenty of uploads elsewhere if you want to hear unaltered sound, here's the one from Klein's own channel (all real 8580 chips!):
