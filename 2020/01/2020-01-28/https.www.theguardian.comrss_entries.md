<p>As the Holocaust ebbs from living memory, survivors of the notorious concentration camp underscore the importance of remembrance in this remarkable documentary</p><p>Belsen: Our Story (BBC Two) is difficult to watch, but as many people should watch it as possible. Over one hour, this sober and simple film, unsparingly matter-of-fact, uses archival audio and video footage to show the horrors of what happened at Bergen-Belsen in Germany between 1940 and 1945. Almost 75 years after the camp was liberated, the film collects together the testimonies of survivors, mostly children at the time, now among the last people able to give first-person accounts of what they suffered, and what was done to them.</p><p><a href="https://www.het.org.uk/index.php/component/content/article/8-cat-the-holocaust-cat-the-holocaust/258-survivors-mt" title="">Mala Tribich</a> was 14 when she was sent to Belsen. In the film, she returns to the ground on which it once stood, and the experience of being there for the first time in 75 years is emotional and traumatic. “It brings it back more vividly,” she says. “It’s hard to bear, even after all these years.” Before Belsen, some of her family members were rounded up by the Nazis, marched into a nearby forest and executed. “So that’s how I lost my mother and sister,” she says, with a gentle, crushing sigh. She recalls finding her way to the children’s barracks at Belsen and how Luba Tryszynska, “the angel of Belsen”, took care of them. She recalls that, on the day British troops liberated the camp, she saw people running. “All I could think was: how have they got the strength to run?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/28/belsen-our-story-review-the-nazi-horrors-that-must-never-be-forgotten">Continue reading...</a>

## Trézéguet sinks Leicester at the last to put Aston Villa in Carabao Cup final

<p>How about this for a rebuttal to Pep Guardiola’s argument for scrapping the Carabao Cup? If Manchester City make the final, the Catalan may discuss the issue face to face with Dean Smith, whose Aston Villa will be at Wembley thanks to a spectacular stoppage-time volley by Trézéguet. The Egyptian’s goal earned Villa a chance to win their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/dean-smith-quotes-leicester-aston-villa-carabao-cup" title="">first major trophy since 1996</a>, which was before the birth of many of the jubilant fans who cavorted across the pitch here at full time.</p><p>Trézéguet was cast into this rollicking contest in the 77th minute, when Leicester were looking the more likely victors. Kelechi Iheanacho had only a few minutes earlier cancelled out Matt Targett’s first-half goal and the momentum looked to be in the visitors’ favour. Villa, however, did not try merely to cling on for a penalty shootout. Instead Trézéguet settled the tie by firing into the net following a splendid cross by his compatriot Ahmed Elmohamady. This, then, was a night of high drama, skill and valour. What’s not to love, Pep?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/aston-villa-leicester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Electric chemistry between Tessa Thompson and Nnamdi Asomugha ignites this loving, lovely tribute to Hollywood melodramas </p><p>In trying to painstakingly recreate the spirit of a specific genre from a specific moment in time, film-makers often fall into pastiche, focusing so hard on the nuts and bolts that they forget to include any heart. A loving homage can then feel like an exercise in technique, all style and no soul. With his second full-length narrative feature Sylvie’s Love, writer-director Eugene Ashe is paying tribute to the glossy studio romances of the 50s and 60s with the keen eye of someone acutely aware of the subgenre he’s targeting, from the plot machinations to the production design. But what makes his film so very special is his equally vested interest in matching the era’s grand emotional stakes. It’s a film that both looks and feels the part, a handsomely made love story that’s easy to fall in love with.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/the-father-review-anthony-hopkins-olivia-colman">The Father review – Anthony Hopkins drives devastating dementia drama</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/28/sylvies-love-review-sundance-tessa-thompson-nnamdi-asomugha">Continue reading...</a>

## Why Thomas Markle should stop calling Prince Harry ‘whipped’

The original term – ‘pussy-whipped’ – is used by men who have a 1970s view of marriage. Not all relationships need to have winners and losers<p>Thomas Markle continues to excel when it comes to dignity and sensitivity, as he calls on Prince Harry to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIvn0b_mLI0" title="">“man up”</a>, and jokingly challenges the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10824859/thomas-markle-meghan-court-evidence/" title="">“candy-ass”</a> royal to a duel. It falls into the “who would win in a fight between a lion and a bear?” category – mighty physical standoffs dreamed up by deranged minds. The kindest thing to do would be to leave him to his duelling imaginings.</p><p>But just one quick thing before we go: Markle calls Harry “whipped”, which is usually used as a contraction of “pussy-whipped”. It is not the first time Harry has had this term levelled at him. In an extraordinary graphic worthy of an incel thread on Reddit, the campaign group Leave.EU showed Harry on all fours. Meghan is holding him by a pair reins, and has a high heel on his back for maximum 70s soft-porn effect (the way Facebook warriors seem to like; nobody knows why).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2020/jan/28/why-thomas-markle-should-stop-calling-prince-harry-whipped">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Grafton Architects, who are about to take the RIBA gold medal, have unveiled their first UK building – a stirring, open-plan library where students can ‘meet and fall in love’</p><p>A raucous urban dance extravaganza might not be every librarian’s idea of a welcome backdrop to their bookshelves. But then not every library is conceived like <a href="https://www.kingston.ac.uk/aboutkingstonuniversity/campus-development/current-projects/town-house/">Town House</a>. From the open-plan study floors of this £50m addition to Kingston University, you can look down into a dramatic triple-height performance space and straight across into the dance studios, where students flex their limbs on wall barres opposite pharmacologists deep in textbooks.<br /><br />“We were attracted by the university’s radical ambition to mix things that are usually incompatible,” says Yvonne Farrell of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/02/grafton-architects-wins-2020-riba-gold-medal-brutalist-buildings">Grafton Architects</a>, the Irish practice responsible for this majestic multilevelled theatre of higher education that has just opened in south-west London. “The building takes pleasure in these abrasions, combining the two extremes of silence and noise.”</p><p>Standing on the former site of some unprepossessing temporary buildings that had outstayed their welcome, the Town House has the bold civic presence of a public facility – which, it turns out, it is. In a brave departure from most security-conscious university buildings, there are no turnstiles or swipe-card access gates to be found here. Instead, an airy atrium welcomes people in through a street-front colonnade, where a ground floor cafe sits beneath a wide open stairway that zig-zags up through the five-storey lobby. The summit is crowned with another public cafe, complete with a roof terrace that commands panoramic views across to Hampton Court Palace and the Thames, twinkling in the distance between the trees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/28/kingston-university-town-house-library-review-oliver-wainwright-grafton-architects-riba-gold">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From men’s magazines to the chiselled gods of Love Island, boys are inundated with messages to both bulk up and moisturise. It all reminds me of my own youth, much of it wasted on bulimia</p><p>It’s that time of the month when an ominous thud through the letterbox heralds the arrival of my 17-year-old son’s Men’s Health magazine. As I pick it up, my eyes narrow in suspicious disapproval. What glistening slab of <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/mesomorph" title="">mesomorph</a> flesh will be on the cover this time? What should my boy build, crush, smash or ignite this month? What body part needs to be dominated? It’s almost certainly something to do with abs: a cursory review of back issues lying around the house reveals only one cover star allowed to wear a top. Men’s Health is no country for the dad bod or for the scrawny goths I idolised during my adolescence: the sheer acreage of veiny thoroughbred muscle on show is enough to give anyone a complex. Honestly, it’s so depressing. Isn’t adolescence hard enough without discovering that even your calves need to be bulked up? What even is a deltoid and can’t we just leave it alone?</p><p>Yet it’s unfair to single out Men’s Health, which has plenty of good, thoughtful coverage of male mental health and stress issues amid all the hard, lean, fat-burning content. It’s also pretty quaint to think any part of the struggling magazine industry could be having a serious impact on boys’ body image with a whole digital world of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/20/fitspo-strong-skinny-social-media-food-abs-better-living-body-fascism" title="">#fitspo and #workout</a> posts to obsess over, and the chiselled gods of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/23/why-weve-fallen-out-of-love-with-love-island" title="">Love Island everywhere in their tiny trunks</a>.

<p>The academic is not the first to suggest that nudes in art were about titillation as much as aesthetics – but is there a difference between nakedness and nudity?</p><p>Mary Beard has revealed in an interview with the Radio Times that she has concerns that female nudes in western art are just “soft porn for the elite, dressed up in a classical guise”. Beard, who is promoting her BBC show The Shock of the Nude, will know this is no revolutionary proposition.</p><p>John Berger’s book Ways of Seeing (1972) explored the difference between nakedness – to be without clothes – and nudity – to be a revealed body on display. “In the average European oil painting of the nude, the principal protagonist is never painted. He is the spectator in front of the picture and he is presumed to be a man … It is for him that the figures have assumed their nudity,” Berger wrote.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2020/jan/28/is-mary-beard-right-to-say-classical-nudes-are-soft-porn-for-the-elite">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Controversial Australian returns to rugby league </li><li>Wigan announce game v Dragons to be Pride Day</li></ul><p>There is anger and frustration across rugby league after the sport’s governing body, the Rugby Football League, sanctioned Catalans Dragons’ move for the controversial Australian Israel Folau on a one-year deal. The French club say they want to give Folau, who has not played either code of rugby since being sacked by Rugby Australia last year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/dec/04/israel-folau-and-rugby-australia-settle-unfair-dismissal-claim-over-social-media-post">following homophobic comments on social media</a>, a “new opportunity to shine”.</p><p>Yet many across a sport which prides itself on inclusivity are furious that Folau has been allowed to return to rugby league. The RFL had no obligation to run the issue past clubs, but given the sensitive nature of Folau’s return to the sport, many are disappointed they were not at least briefed. The Guardian understands that Super League clubs were told about the news just minutes before Catalans’ official announcement.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/28/israel-folau-switches-codes-again-to-sign-for-catalans-dragons-rugby-league">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The poet and performer on keeping his clothes simple, stapling them back together, and being fashionable once every 15 years for about three months<br /></p><p>This is my default look. I operate on a capsule wardrobe because I spend a lot of time on the road, so I ain’t got the whole rainbow spectrum of colours in my luggage. I keep it simple: a dark suit with a pale shirt. Here [at the Contains Strong Language spoken word festival in 2017] I’ve also got a bolo tie, which chimes in with the snakeskin boots by Jeffery West.</p><p>I’m obsessed with clothes and I find it very easy to write about them. I’m fashionable once every 15 years, for about three months. My look is very easy to maintain but that wasn’t always the case – in the 80s, I couldn’t find anything. Every time I obtained a tubular Ivy League blazer that didn’t have padded shoulders I had to treat it like it was made out of gold. They were never out of the dry cleaners – I’d only wear them to weddings, funerals and gigs, and I’ve still got them now. Some are held together by staples because the lining’s falling out, but you see them in photoshoots and they still look the business.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/28/john-cooper-clarke-i-have-dressed-the-same-way-since-1965">Continue reading...</a>

## Nightmares on wax: the environmental impact of the vinyl revival

<p>From toxic wastewater to greenhouse gas emissions, the boom in vinyl has dangerous effects – but streaming isn’t as clean an alternative as it looks</p><p>Inside a US <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/vinyl">vinyl</a> pressing plant – its owners have asked that I do not give its location – dozens of hydraulic machines run all day and night. These contraptions fill the building, as long as a city block, with hissing and clanking as well as the sweet-and-sour notes of warm grease and melted plastic. They look like relics, because they are. The basic technological principles of record pressing have not changed for a century, and the machines themselves are decades old.</p><p>While it is far exceeded by revenues from streaming, the vinyl market keeps growing – Americans now spend as much on vinyl as they do on CDs, while there were 4.3m vinyl sales in the UK last year, the 12th consecutive year of growth. So, if you’re one of the millions of people to re-embrace vinyl records, it’s worth knowing where they come from and how they’re made. There are containers called hoppers at each pressing station, brimming with the lentil-like polymer pellets that get funnelled down into the machinery, heated and fused to form larger biscuits that resemble hockey pucks, and squashed to make records.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/28/vinyl-record-revival-environmental-impact-music-industry-streaming">Continue reading...</a>

Now 32 and in the autumn of his career, the diminutive striker – nay, footballing God – continues to score at an unthinkable rate of almost a goal a game and could yet add to the 34 club titles (10 La Ligas; 6 Copa del Reys; 8 Supercopa de Españas; 4 Champions Leagues; 3 Uefa Super Cups; 3 Fifa Club World Cups) and six Ballon d’Ors he has accumulated over the years. This photograph was taken in Rome in 2009 when Messi inspired Barcelona to a 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final. The boyish delight etched across his face makes this a gem of a picture and fuels my admiration for his evergreen talents. Messi growing old and retiring?

<p>I’ve taken part in quizzes all my life: in schools, in pubs and on TV shows, from India to the US. But the biggest secret is that curiosity, not knowledge, is the key to success. By Samanth Subramanian</p><p>Last March, when I went to Las Vegas for the very first time, I made sure to pack pens and paper. I knew we would need the supplies. We converged from various points on the US map: six of us, a guys’ weekend in Sin City. On Friday afternoon, we dawdled in the Hard Rock hotel, waiting with impatience for the action to begin. Dusk fell, the neon rose, and we gathered in the lobby. Together we walked through the maze of slot machines and blackjack tables, past the bar and the steakhouse, past the flyers for burlesque revues and up into the nightclub.</p><p>And there, having spurned the vices of Vegas, we indulged our own, clustered around our team’s answer sheet as a quizmaster barked questions at us. The weekend, Geek Bowl XIII, had been put together as a blowout for quiz fiends who attended bar trivia nights across the US and still yearned for more. Friday was a warm-up quiz: calisthenics before the big game. On Saturday, 240 teams spent the evening packed into a Hard Rock auditorium, sweating their brains over 65 questions. You could buy beer and snacks while you quizzed, but no one seemed particularly keen on alcohol. You drink to forget; you quiz to remember. The only Elvis impersonators I saw that weekend were part of a special round in the quiz, in which Vegas street-theatre performers staged cryptic re-enactments of famous movie scenes. (We had to identify the movies.) Another round had questions to which the answers all included types of cheese: Alison Brie, Goat, Grand Coulee Dam. In a third, we had to construct portmanteau phrases from images of snacks and celebrities. NutElla Fitzgerald. OvalTina Turner. Desmond TuTuna Helper. No quiz I’ve ever attended has provoked this much pained groaning at the answers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/28/question-time-my-life-as-a-quiz-obsessive">Continue reading...</a>
