This photograph was taken in Rome in 2009 when Messi inspired Barcelona to a 2-0 victory over Manchester United in the Champions League final. The boyish delight etched across his face makes this a gem of a picture and fuels my admiration for his evergreen talents. Messi growing old and retiring?

But the biggest secret is that curiosity, not knowledge, is the key to success. By Samanth Subramanian</p><p>Last March, when I went to Las Vegas for the very first time, I made sure to pack pens and paper. I knew we would need the supplies. We converged from various points on the US map: six of us, a guys\u2019 weekend in Sin City. On Friday afternoon, we dawdled in the Hard Rock hotel, waiting with impatience for the action to begin. Dusk fell, the neon rose, and we gathered in the lobby. Together we walked through the maze of slot machines and blackjack tables, past the bar and the steakhouse, past the flyers for burlesque revues and up into the nightclub.</p><p>And there, having spurned the vices of Vegas, we indulged our own, clustered around our team\u2019s answer sheet as a quizmaster barked questions at us. The weekend, Geek Bowl XIII, had been put together as a blowout for quiz fiends who attended bar trivia nights across the US and still yearned for more. Friday was a warm-up quiz: calisthenics before the big game. On Saturday, 240 teams spent the evening packed into a Hard Rock auditorium, sweating their brains over 65 questions. You could buy beer and snacks while you quizzed, but no one seemed particularly keen on alcohol. You drink to forget; you quiz to remember. The only Elvis impersonators I saw that weekend were part of a special round in the quiz, in which Vegas street-theatre performers staged cryptic re-enactments of famous movie scenes. (We had to identify the movies.) Another round had questions to which the answers all included types of cheese: Alison Brie, Goat, Grand Coulee Dam. In a third, we had to construct portmanteau phrases from images of snacks and celebrities. NutElla Fitzgerald. OvalTina Turner. Desmond TuTuna Helper. No quiz I\u2019ve ever attended has provoked this much pained groaning at the answers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/28/question-time-my-life-as-a-quiz-obsessive\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/28/question-time-my-life-as-a-quiz-obsessive", "date_published": "2020-01-28 06:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Armando Iannucci on politics and satire -\u00a0podcast", "description": "<p>The creator of The Thick of It and Veep discusses why modern politics has moved beyond satire.
