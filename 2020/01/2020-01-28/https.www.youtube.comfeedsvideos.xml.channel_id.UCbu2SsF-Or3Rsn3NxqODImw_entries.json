Act V might be the only new chapter in Kentucky Route Zero, but the entire game holds up today--offering a point-and-click adventure where every choice, even the more subtle ones, can carry an impact.\n\nKentucky Route Zero TV Edition is available for Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i18WHcceTVw", "date_published": "2020-01-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
