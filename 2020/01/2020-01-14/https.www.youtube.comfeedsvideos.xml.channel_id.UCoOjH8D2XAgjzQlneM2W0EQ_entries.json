The point at which computers will match or exceed human intelligence.\n\nIf you think about it, all humanity has ever achieved has been because of 3 factors: how much information we can take in, how much information we can process, and how much information we can put out.\n\nEvery problem we haven\u2019t solved yet - curing cancer, going to mars, all comes back to how fast, or how slow, we can interact or interface with the world around us\n\nThe real bottleneck are the first and last factors\n\nCompare that to artificial intelligence - when it reaches its singularity point, it will be able to think like us and process info like us, except it won\u2019t have the bottleneck of physical bodies.\n\nHumanity\u2019s \u201cinterface\u201d with the world, our senses and physical bodies have very \u201clow bandwidth\u201d as Elon Musk likes to call it\n\nIn 2017, Elon Musk launched a secretive startup called Neuralink.\n\nNeuralink\u2019s long term goal is to free humanity from this bottleneck by bypassing our archaic limbs altogether, and augment that connection between our brains and the outside world with a computer chip that connects the two together. AKA cyborgs with what\u2019s called Brain-Machine Interface devices or BMI\u2019s\n\nOnce you have the BMI installed, it would connect wirelessly to an outside wearable so you don\u2019t have wires sticking out of your head and to a smartphone app\n\nWith something like this, as the technology progresses, Neuralink offer us, not just a way out, but a way in to ride the wave of real Ai, instead of being crushed by Skynet\n\nA lot of people talk about how revolutionary Ai is, blockchain, even me with quantum computing\nBut if you think about it - all those innovations operate outside of humans, it\u2019s just another tool we interact with\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
