Now, at 54, the cracks, bags and blotches are taking over; a new pop-up makeup counter for men could be what I need. It has popped up at John Lewis\u2019s Oxford Street store in London, which is safe and reliable, right? And the British brand doing it is called War Paint for Men. Yeah, I\u2019m not just beautifying myself, I\u2019m a warrior!</p><p>The War Paint founder Danny Gray, 34 (looks younger), will be doing my makeup today, quite publicly, in the menswear department on the ground floor. Since being bullied for his sticky-out ears at school, Gray has experienced body dysmorphia. When, as a teenager, he started getting spots, his sister offered to help conceal them.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2020/jan/14/face-time-will-the-new-makeup-for-men-hide-my-blotches-or-create-new-anxieties\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2020/jan/14/face-time-will-the-new-makeup-for-men-hide-my-blotches-or-create-new-anxieties", "date_published": "2020-01-14 07:30:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Gambling watchdog bans credit cards for online betting sites", "description": "<p>Move follows warnings from campaigners that gamblers risked racking up huge debts</p><p>Gambling businesses are to be banned from allowing consumers in Britain to use credit cards to bet from 14 April, the Gambling Commission has announced.</p><p>The move comes two years after charity groups including GambleAware and Citizens Advice <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/ban-credit-cards-for-online-gambling-says-government-review\">urged the government to implement the policy</a> to protect people from sliding into addiction.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/14/gambling-watchdog-bans-credit-cards-for-online-betting-sites\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/14/gambling-watchdog-bans-credit-cards-for-online-betting-sites", "date_published": "2020-01-14 07:26:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "From Cats to The Goldfinch: Oscarbait movies the Academy shunned in 2020", "description": "<p>This year\u2019s nominations have shown love for Joker and 1917 but a host of awards-primed films have been left out in the cold</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/13/cats-the-goldfinch-oscarbait-movies-academy-2020\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/13/cats-the-goldfinch-oscarbait-movies-academy-2020", "date_published": "2020-01-14 07:15:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Sonos Move review: brilliant sound now portable", "description": "<p>Wireless smart speaker with 10-hour battery, room-filling sound, wifi and Bluetooth is not your ordinary portable speaker</p><p>Sonos has finally made a portable wifi and Bluetooth speaker that sounds great \u2013 but it\u2019s not quite what most will have imagined.</p><p>For years Sonos has made some of the very best wifi speakers, recently adding optional voice assistants from Google and Amazon.

Even runners who dislike tech can\u2019t bear to be without it. By Rose George</p><p>On Ilkley Moor in west Yorkshire on a Tuesday evening in May, 200 people milled about in glorious sunshine, ready to run the five-mile Jack Bloor race over moors recently blackened in a fire, but still beautiful. The air was clear, the good cheer was tangible, the moor birds clucked high up on the hill that we would soon have to climb.</p><p>We gathered at the start, and everything proceeded as it does at fell races: someone gave inaudible instructions and then said something like: \u201cRight then, off you go.\u201d Fell running \u2013 making your own way between checkpoints over moorland, hill or mountain \u2013 thinks itself a pure yet humble sport. Fell runners have no truck with fancy gear like road runners do, or shiny poles like ultrarunners. We don\u2019t even need paths. Some of this purist attitude comes from where we run, through thigh-deep bogs and leg-scraping bracken, down scree and boulders at the pace of a fearless child. We run against the elements as much as against other runners.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/14/kudos-leaderboards-qoms-how-fitness-app-strava-became-a-religion\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/14/kudos-leaderboards-qoms-how-fitness-app-strava-became-a-religion", "date_published": "2020-01-14 06:00:27+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "At least six dead after huge sinkhole in China swallows bus and pedestrians", "description": "<p>Footage on state TV shows the vehicle disappearing inside the sinkhole in the city of Xining as people run away </p><p>An enormous sinkhole has swallowed a bus and pedestrians in China, killing six people and leaving 10 missing.</p><p>Footage on state media showed people at a bus stop running from the collapsing road, as the bus \u2013 jutting into the air \u2013 sank.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/at-least-dead-after-huge-sinkhole-in-china-swallows-bus\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/at-least-dead-after-huge-sinkhole-in-china-swallows-bus", "date_published": "2020-01-14 04:17:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Why did former Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn choose a life on the run? - podcast", "description": "<p>The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan\u2019s most respected business people.
