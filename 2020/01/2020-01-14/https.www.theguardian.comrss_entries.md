## Mindfulness in the mountains: does your winter holiday hold the key to wellness?

<p>Research shows that skiing not only improves fitness and tones you up, it also boosts your mental health. So book your winter holiday to the mountains safe in the knowledge that you’ll return home healthier and happier</p><p>Arguably, we don’t need a doctor to tell us that mucking about in beautiful snowy mountains is the perfect antidote to stress, or that cheese-smothered meals in cosy mountain huts are good for the soul. As the <a href="https://clubmed-skireport.realise.com/?utm_medium=Partnerships&amp;utm_campaign=RF_Guardian_Content_Hub&amp;utm_source=Guardian" rel="nofollow">Club Med ski report 2019/2020</a> revealed, 89% of Brits believe that skiing and snowboarding have a positive impact on their mental health, with half of those polled stating that they feel calmer during a winter sports holiday.</p><p>And there’s science to back it up: merely being in the great outdoors is shown to lower blood pressure, reduce levels of the stress hormone cortisol and deliver a healthy dose of mood-boosting vitamin D. Cardiovascular exercise, meanwhile, releases smile-inducing endorphins and dopamine. As the Mental Health Foundation confirms: “Even a short burst of 10 minutes’ brisk walking increases our mental alertness, energy and positive mood.” With the Club Med report showing that nearly three-quarters (73%) of British winter holidaymakers spend on average four hours or more skiing and snowboarding each day, that’s a lot of happy hormones bouncing around the pistes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/ready-set-ski/2020/jan/14/mindfulness-in-the-mountains-does-your-winter-holiday-hold-the-key-to-wellness">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This year’s Academy Awards show that diversity drives will only get us so far. Filmgoers and the industry must question what makes a film award-worthy</p><p>Congratulations to those men – I guess? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/13/congratulations-to-those-men-issa-raes-quip-sums-up-oscar-frustration">Issa Rae summarised the mixed feelings of many</a> when yet another all-male list of best director Oscar nominations was announced yesterday. It’s possible to note – entirely without snide – that it has been a bumper year for films about men by men. The frontrunners – Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman, Sam Mendes’ 1917, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/13/oscars-2020-shallow-joker-squats-on-top-of-patchy-and-infuriating-nominations">even Todd Phillips’ Joker</a> – provided plentiful and pertinent insights into male power, male ego and male fallibility. But what about the rest of us?</p><p>We must content ourselves with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/25/little-women-review-greta-gerwig-saoirse-ronan-emma-watson">Little Women</a>, the lone female-directed film on the best picture list, for, as Aunt March would counsel, that is our lot in life. After decades of being mischaracterised as a cosy tale about sweet-natured sisters and their domestic trifles, Louisa May Alcott’s sardonically titled Little Women finally has a faithful adaptation. Under Greta Gerwig’s passionate direction, it rages righteously about the patriarchy’s narrow definition of artistic merit – amusingly embodied by Tracy Letts’ belittling publisher, Dashwood – and how it works to crush female creativity. How apt.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/14/oscars-how-long-can-this-nonsense-of-the-oscars-failing-to-nominate-female-directors-go-on">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With an Amazon Echo Dot at hand, Alim Kheraj learns to break free of social media bad habits</p><p>I used to feel quite superior because of how little I relied on the tiny gods in our pockets – the devices that require so much time and devotion from everyone else. Then I started to get “screen time” notifications. This unwanted weekly intrusion was sobering: on average, I was using my phone for nearly four hours a day. And the bulk of that time was spent on social media.</p><p>When I really thought about it, I could see how this came to be. Setting an alarm before bed turned into scrolling through Twitter for an hour; checking the weather became a marathon Reddit session.

<p>The quarterback was an afterthought less than two years ago: now he is the star of LSU’s successful national championship campaign</p><p>It looked like Mardi Gras come early: purple and gold confetti on green turf, laws fallen by the wayside for this one night, at least. Down here in New Orleans they’re always more like suggestions anyway: a red light means pause, sip a beer in the passenger seat, and no smoking in the Superdome means light a fat cigar. So there was Joe Burrow on Monday night, still in uniform but taking a few long puffs before detailing exactly how he and his LSU team, college football national champions now, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/14/lsu-clemson-college-football-playoff-championship">had just dismantled Clemson, 42-25</a>.</p><p>Barely an hour earlier, Burrow threw his 60th touchdown pass of the season, setting a new NCAA single-season record. The quarterback had rebounded from a first quarter in which LSU punted on their first three drives to finish with 463 passing yards, five touchdown passes and another touchdown run. He won the Heisman Trophy last month, will likely be the NFL draft’s first pick in another three, and on Monday he handed off his cigar for safekeeping before making his public comments. “This is special,” he said. “This doesn’t happen – this doesn’t come around every year. This is a special group of guys that really came together, and it’s as close of a group as I’ve ever been around.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/14/joe-burrow-from-back-up-quarterback-to-likely-nfl-no1-overall-pick">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How did a church in a quiet Sussex borough end up with an astonishing, hand-painted copy of the world’s most famous ceiling? Deacon Gary Bevans talks us through his creation</p><p>The Sistine Chapel is easy to find. Just follow the A259 through Goring-by-Sea until you see the low, spireless red brick English Martyrs Church. Enter this Catholic place of worship – <a href="https://www.visitsoutheastengland.com/things-to-do/english-martyrs-church-p372961">and look up</a>.Above the simple wooden pews, laid out in bold yellows, greens, pinks and blues, you can see God dividing the land and waters, making the sun and Earth, reaching out a powerful finger to spark life into Adam.</p><p>It’s Michelangelo’s masterpiece all right, superbly replicated by the Sussex church’s deacon, Gary Bevans. Created between 1987 and 1993, his achievement seems all the more remarkable now that digital reproductions of the original are having a bit of a moment. HBO’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/oct/27/jude-law-young-pope-sky-atlantic">The Young Pope</a> and its follow-up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law">The New Pope</a> both use hi-tech digital copies, as does Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/12/the-two-popes-anthony-hopkins-and-jonathan-pryce-divine-in-papal-faceoff">The Two Popes</a>.

<p>With some small tweaks, SMEs can better prepare themselves against the damage inflicted by late payments</p><p>Although he started his business 10 years ago, Rob Drake, co-founder of <a href="https://bravesparkmedia.com/" rel="nofollow">Brave Spark Media</a>, says he still worries about late payments. “When it was just me and the other founder, [being paid on time] was the difference between us paying our rent or mortgages,” he says. “As we’ve scaled up, and taken on our own staff, it almost becomes a bigger problem. While before you were worrying about your own bills, you’re suddenly worrying about 30 other people.”</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.fsb.org.uk/media-centre/small-business-statistics" rel="nofollow">Federation of Small Businesses</a> (FSB), there were 5.8m SMEs in the UK at the start of 2019. There’s been an increase of 69% since 2000, with 16.6 million people employed by a sector responsible for an estimated turnover of £2.2tn. Late payments are an everyday reality for many of them – <a href="https://www.xero.com/content/dam/xero/pdf/state-of-late-payments/State-of-late-payments_report_2019.pdf" rel="nofollow">research from Xero</a> found 48% of invoices issued by small businesses are paid after their due date, amounting to a total deficit of £131bn (or £23,360 each).

(By comparison 12 people were <a href="https://www.bristol.gov.uk/documents/20182/34140/Bristol+Road+Casualty+Review+2017.pdf/941a0e58-4884-5f6d-83fe-477b709d93f8" title="">killed in Bristol</a>, a city slightly smaller than Oslo, in 2017 – and over half of them were pedestrians or cyclists.)</p><p>The catch? The lives saved in Norway seem to have been a byproduct of a bigger plan to become a carbon-neutral city that would probably spark a mutiny if you tried it here. Oslo has closed some streets to traffic entirely, removed parking spaces across the city to deter drivers, introduced measures to stop parents doing the school run by car and reduced speed limits. There’s plentiful public transport and lots of bike lanes but the bottom line is, <a href="https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/drivers-are-guests-how-oslo-cut-traffic-deaths-to-almost-zero-in-2019-4923" title="">as Oslo’s mayor says</a>, that while cities will always have traffic, “the drivers should act as guests”.

It is fused with the wandering consciousness of an avatar from the future examining her treatment by society.

In key scenes we share the perceptions of the older woman left alone to die on the floor, seeing not only how she is ignored in her final minutes but also how wider society has ignored her for years before, uncaring of the rich experiences of her life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/14/virtual-reality-show-challenge-care-older-people">Continue reading...</a>

So why is she still having to defend her past?</p><p>About a year ago, Cher Lloyd was shopping in the Disney Store on Oxford Street when she was approached by a new fan: a middle-aged man who told her that he had seen her recent appearance on Loose Women. “He went: ‘I just want to say, you’re nothing like I thought you were gonna be like – you’re not horrible at all,’” Lloyd remembers. “My heart sank.”</p><p>The experience has stayed with her as an example of the “heartbreaking” perception of her in the UK – not that she has ever been allowed to forget it. Nearly a decade has passed since her barnstorming X Factor audition of Soulja Boy and Keri Hilson’s Turn My Swag On, still hailed by many as a touchstone in the show’s history.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/14/cher-lloyd-x-factor-singer-damage-control">Continue reading...</a>

<p>ITV’s trashy singing contest is a constant, crushing disappointment – but it’s also a total hoot. Could the bee really be Cara Delevingne?</p><p>If I had to describe The Masked Singer to someone who hadn’t seen it I would say it was like the outcome of the “make a TV show” challenge on The Apprentice. In case you have somehow missed its OTT weirdness, the premise is as follows: 12 celebrities sing in outrageous fancy dress costumes, and you – along with a panel of celebrity judges (including Ken Jeong from The Hangover, for some reason) – try to work out who they are. Hence the incredibly strange viral moment that did the rounds last week of “a pharaoh” taking off his mask to reveal the former home secretary <a href="https://twitter.com/aljwhite/status/1213937764405796865" title="">Alan Johnson</a>.</p><p>Let me be clear: The Masked Singer is bad television. The Guardian review of the show gave it one star, calling it a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/04/the-masked-singer-review-is-that-angela-lansbury-singing-you-got-the-love-if-only" title="">prerecorded unspectacular crushed at birth by its contrived premise</a>”. There are many moments I know I will recount one day in some form of therapy, such as the time a 6ft duck sang <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ2NcQwqzhw" title="">Like a Virgin</a> while also somehow dressed as Madonna, before returning the next week to sing Ave Maria while a jealous chameleon looked on. The celebrities’ speaking voices are troubling, too, having been hidden in such a weird way that they all sound like disoriented, hungover Doctor Who villains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/14/silly-naff-unmissable-the-masked-singer-is-a-truly-terrible-delight">Continue reading...</a>

## Stop talking about 'wine o'clock': Holly Whitaker on how women can stop drinking – and get happy

<p>When she decided to quit drinking, Whitaker turned, like many people, to Alcoholics Anonymous. She didn’t like what she found there, so she decided to create her own unique approach</p><p>When Holly Whitaker looks back on the many nights that would disappear in a boozy haze, it wasn’t the anxiety and regret that made her realise she needed to get help for her drinking, but sheer exhaustion. Each weekend, while hungover, she would wearily erase all evidence of her drinking binges: the stains on her bed, the empty bottles, the rubbish bags. She was holding it together with a lucrative job as the director of a healthcare startup, had a great flat in San Francisco and a busy social life, but suddenly she just couldn’t do it any more.</p><p>“When I binged, I would close my eyes while I did it,” she says. “I was trying to not see how horrific it was. I would go through this process of scrubbing it away, then presenting myself to the world and pretending that nothing was wrong. Then I had this moment when I couldn’t not see it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/14/aas-rules-are-for-men-holly-whitaker-on-how-women-can-stop-drinking-and-get-happy">Continue reading...</a>

It is made of 521 separate bits of plastic, it was one of the bestselling Christmas toys, and fans of the movie on which it is based will surely spend several hours of magical, creative play with it.</p><p>But those few hours may well be the last that this and many other toys are used. Thousands of plastic castles, farmyards and games, as well as myriad other presents, have probably already been stuffed into bulging cupboards to be thrown away in a year or two to make room for yet more plastic. And, because most plastic is near impossible to recycle, these toys will probably have to be landfilled or burned in incinerators, poisoning the air and further adding to global heating.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/14/plastic-waste-crisis-recycling-consumption-environmentally-friendly">Continue reading...</a>

It was so innovative that when the judges scored her routine 9.80 out of 10, placing her second overall, there were howls of disapproval from the crowd. They believed the 17-year-old Soviet gymnast, the darling of the Games, should have become the first to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics. Instead, that honour went to the great Nadia Comaneci four years later. Korbut did at least claim gold medals in three other disciplines at the Games, though her flip was later outlawed for being too dangerous.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/14/buy-a-classic-sport-photograph-olga-korbut-seeks-perfection">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Strava app offers community, training data and motivation to millions of athletes. Even runners who dislike tech can’t bear to be without it. By Rose George</p><p>On Ilkley Moor in west Yorkshire on a Tuesday evening in May, 200 people milled about in glorious sunshine, ready to run the five-mile Jack Bloor race over moors recently blackened in a fire, but still beautiful. The air was clear, the good cheer was tangible, the moor birds clucked high up on the hill that we would soon have to climb.</p><p>We gathered at the start, and everything proceeded as it does at fell races: someone gave inaudible instructions and then said something like: “Right then, off you go.” Fell running – making your own way between checkpoints over moorland, hill or mountain – thinks itself a pure yet humble sport. Fell runners have no truck with fancy gear like road runners do, or shiny poles like ultrarunners. We don’t even need paths. Some of this purist attitude comes from where we run, through thigh-deep bogs and leg-scraping bracken, down scree and boulders at the pace of a fearless child. We run against the elements as much as against other runners.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/14/kudos-leaderboards-qoms-how-fitness-app-strava-became-a-religion">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The former CEO of Nissan, Carlos Ghosn, was once one of Japan’s most respected business people. Now, as the Guardian’s Justin McCurry reports, he’s on the run in Lebanon after fleeing the country to escape financial misconduct charges. Also today: Gary Younge looks back on the opportunities he had as he bows out after 26 years at the Guardian</p><p>Stories in the business pages don’t often catch the eye of Hollywood scriptwriters. But the case of Carlos Ghosn is an exception. Over Christmas, the former boss of the Japanese car giant Nissan, wearing a disguise, reportedly hid inside a musical instrument case and jumped bail from financial misconduct charges in Japan to Lebanon.</p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Justin McCurry </strong>has been following the story from Tokyo and watched as Ghosn broke cover at an extraordinary press conference last week from Beirut in which he called out former colleagues and the entire Japanese justice system. It now appears unlikely that Ghosn will ever face charges in a Japanese – but has he instead chosen the life of a fugitive?<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/14/why-did-former-nissan-boss-carlos-ghosn-choose-a-life-on-the-run-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
