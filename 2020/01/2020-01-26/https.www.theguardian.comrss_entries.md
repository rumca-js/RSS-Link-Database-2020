<p>An electrifying lead performance papers over some of the more cartoonish cracks in a timely, darkly comic thriller about a woman on a mission </p><p>There aren’t many films at this year’s Sundance film festival that boast a premise quite as tantalising as that of Promising Young Woman, a candy-coloured yet darkly themed comic thriller. It goes like this: Cassie (Carey Mulligan) spends her weekends feigning close-to-blackout drunk behaviour in order to lure guys who see her as easy prey, to see how far they’re willing to go sexually with someone unable to provide consent. The ones who fail? The ones who continue to push despite the fact that she is pulling back? Well, something horrible awaits ...</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/26/shirley-review-elisabeth-moss-literary-psychodrama">Shirley review – Elisabeth Moss anchors darkly compelling literary psychodrama</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/26/promising-young-woman-carey-mulligan-sundance-metoo">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Enjoy the beauty of a tiny young crescent moon as it approaches conjunction with Venus, the brightest planet</p><p>Observers in both hemispheres have the opportunity to see an extremely thin crescent moon this evening and tomorrow. Such tiny lunar slivers are extraordinarily beautiful but often hard to locate. Although this one takes place in the constellation of Aquarius, the water bearer, which is notoriously devoid of bright stars to act as wayfinders, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/venus">Venus</a>, the brightest planet, is helpfully on hand to guide our view. From London, look south-west this evening. The chart shows the view at 18:00GMT. From Sydney, look due south. The moon will be lower than Venus and just 7% of its surface will be illuminated. If you do not manage to catch a glimpse of the moon tonight then don’t worry, tomorrow is also good. Over the next 24 hours, the moon will have drawn level with Venus in the sky, and 13% of its surface will now be illuminated. Given clear skies, this conjunction is really worth making the effort to see. It will be a picture perfect end to the first month of the year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/26/starwatch-find-a-sliver-of-moon-guided-by-brilliant-venus">Continue reading...</a>

Mohammed bin Salman’s antics are making it hard for western allies to paint his country as a competent regional partner<p>There’s a famous scene from The Dark Knight in which the Joker gives a rare insight into why he does his disruptive, anarchic things. “I’m like a dog chasing cars,” he says, “I wouldn’t know what to do if I caught one, you know, I just do … things.” There is a certain Middle Eastern prince whose actions can be most accurately explained by this philosophy. A combination of an indulged upbringing, complete unaccountability and vast sovereign wealth has created in Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman (commonly known as MBS) a sort of anarchic, comic-book villain.</p><p>There was the botched murder of the journalist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/jamal-khashoggi" title="">Jamal Khashoggi</a>, whose killing not only occurred in a bugged embassy but one where CCTV caught his murderers (who had used their real passports, with their real names) attempting to use a body double in his clothes.

The horrors of Auschwitz and other Nazi death camps will soon be lost to living memory. But the recent rise in xenophobic nationalism underlines the need never to forget<p>Four years after the liberation of the largest Nazi extermination camp, on 27 January 1945, the German philosopher Theodor Adorno <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Prisms.html?id=f1y_dX04yBgC" title="">observed</a>: “To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric.” He came to revise that view, along with its implication that a kind of silence was perhaps the only possible response to the horror of the Holocaust. Later, he wrote that “perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man to scream”.</p><p>Survivor testimony has always been crucial in keeping alive the memory of a unique episode of human depravity. The courage and mental fortitude of those who have borne witness to the industrialised murder of 6 million Jews has played a vital role in helping inoculate European societies against the virus of antisemitism. But that era of witness is coming to an end. During the last five years, almost <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/world/europe/auschwitz-liberation-75th-anniversary.html" title="">half the remaining survivors</a> have passed away. On Monday, some 120 Holocaust survivors from around the world will attend a ceremony to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the Red Army’s arrival at the gates of Auschwitz; it is likely to be the last gathering of its kind at a significant anniversary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/26/the-guardian-view-on-holocaust-memorial-day-as-necessary-as-ever">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A perversely entertaining take on a brief period of Shirley Jackson’s life gives the star one of her most daring roles to date</p><p>As willfully unconventional as a literary portrait could possibly be, Madeline’s Madeline director Josephine Decker’s take on Shirley Jackson is a thrillingly perverse example of what happens when the shackles of biopic formula are cast aside. Based on Shirley: A Novel, the acclaimed book from Susan Scarf Merrell, Shirley tells of a fictitious dynamic, an imagined period where a younger couple moved in with Jackson and her husband, but weaves in known details about the reclusive horror writer’s life and personality. It’s a strange construction but one that feels fitting given what we know of her, a woman who found reality and the rules that came with it to be rather pedestrian. It’s as unusual a film as she was an author and one imagines she’d get a devious kick out of the dark places the film takes us to.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/26/worth-review-michael-keaton-911-drama">Worth review – Michael Keaton excels in powerful 9/11 drama</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/26/shirley-review-elisabeth-moss-literary-psychodrama">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From minor strains to more serious injuries, rest and the right exercises will usually get you back on your feet and on the path to recovery</p><p>Most strains you get day-to-day or doing recreational sport are mild to moderate, and they tend to heal really well on their own. If it’s just a little bit sore with some swelling, give it a few days’ rest then get back to your daily routine – not necessarily running, if that’s how you sprained it, but the sooner you start the rehab process by using the muscle again, the better.</p><p>If it was a calf injury, for example, two days later you might start doing some calf raises – just raising your heel off the floor from standing or sitting. The <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/exercise/strength-exercises/" title="">NHS website</a> has resources for strengthening exercises that are generally reliable.

Make time for it, discuss your new ideas for the bedroom – and learn the difference between spontaneous and responsive desire<p>The No 1 tip from sex therapists and educators for couples who want to have more sex is to consciously make time for it – don’t leave it to chance. You wouldn’t leave going to the cinema with a friend to chance, says the psychosexual counsellor Nicola Buchanan. “You would plan and find what works for both of you. We need to put some time aside to reconnect and create the opportunity for sex.” Murray Blacket, another psychosexual therapist registered with the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists (COSRT), suggests that couples with flexible working patterns could both choose the same day to work from home. “Cheeky, yes, but couples who work from home together by all accounts get up to no good together, too.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/26/identify-your-accelerator-and-four-other-ways-to-have-more-sex-with-your-partner">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Famous for his languid charm, Bill Nighy is anything but relaxed. He talks acting, anxiety – and the dreadful challenge of casual dressing</p><p>The first time I interviewed <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/bill-nighy" title="">Bill Nighy</a> was in 2004. Sixteen years ago! He has barely changed. He is a remarkably consistent person, in taste and personality, and because of this, he seems ageless. Perhaps a little slimmer and greyer than he used to be, but that’s it. His hair is styled in the same way it has been for several decades – longer on the top, slicked back from his forehead – and no matter what year, what month, what day you catch him, he will be dressed in what he calls “a decent lounge suit”, in navy, with appropriate shirt and shoes. Heavy-rimmed specs nestle in his pocket or on his nose.</p><p>As familiar as his outfit is his charm. Nighy is always charming, whether to fans, an interviewer, a waiter. We meet in a hotel bar around the corner from his apartment in Piccadilly and the first thing he does is inquire about me and <em>my</em> life. And he listens to the answer: a nice trait not evident in every successful actor. He bothers to entertain – his stories are delivered well, whether they’re about famous people or someone he met out and about. He still works very hard – often making four or five films a year – and he takes pleasure in his job and is happy to talk about it. In fact, the only major change in Nighy in the years I’ve known him is that he is no longer with his long-term partner, Diana Quick (they separated in 2008, after 28 years together). They remain on good terms and, he tells me, they had a jolly Christmas with lots of people around the table. His daughter, Mary, is married to a Frenchman. “There were charades,” he says. “We sang the Marseillaise. It was great.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/26/bill-nighy-interview-emma-on-screen-anxiety-confidence-playlists-football-clothes">Continue reading...</a>

## The Personal History of David Copperfield review – Iannucci makes Dickens his own

<p>Armando Iannucci both respects and reinvents the novel in a wonderfully entertaining adaptation full to bursting with fantastic comic performances</p><p>Having found unexpected laughter in the historical horrors of <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/oct/22/the-death-of-stalin-review-more-bleak-than-black-armando-iannucci" title="">The Death of Stalin</a></em>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/30/armando-iannucci-david-copperfield-loop-death-of-stalin" title="">Armando Iannucci</a> works comedic wonders with the labyrinthine twists and turns of Dickens’s endlessly reinterpretable Victorian narrative. Astutely amplifying the absurdist – and remarkably modernist – elements of his source, Iannucci and co-writer Simon Blackwell conjure a surreal cinematic odyssey that is as accessible as it is intelligent and unexpected. At its heart lies a theatrical journey of self-discovery, in which our narrator (superbly played by the endlessly versatile Dev Patel) sets out to determine whether he is “the hero of my own story”, struggling to make a name for himself (literally) as he strides through a vividly realised landscape of memory and invention.</p><p>We open with Copperfield on stage, commencing the recitation of his story before striding through a painted backdrop straight into the glowing landscape of East Anglia. It’s a device that will be revisited as scenes fall away like tarpaulin backdrops and memories are projected on to walls, interspersed by handwritten chapter-headings. As with Michael Winterbottom’s <em>Tristram Shandy</em> adaptation <em>A Cock &amp; Bull Story</em>, Iannucci plays inventively with the creative process, displaying a keen eye for visual storytelling as the adult Copperfield witnesses his own birth, comes face to face with his boyish younger self (a terrific performance by Ranveer Jaiswal), and learns to weave characters in and out of his life as he pens a “written memory wherein loss and love live for ever side by side”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/26/the-personal-history-of-david-copperfield-review-armando-iannucci-dev-patel">Continue reading...</a>

When Brown moved to New York in 1984 to edit <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/nov/19/the-vanity-fair-diaries-review-tina-brown-balancing-act" title=""><em>Vanity Fair</em></a>, Jones moved too, in 1988.</p><p>Nearly a decade later, in 1997, he was sent to photograph <em>Vanity Fair</em>’s annual Oscars bash by Brown’s successor as editor, Graydon Carter. He was struggling to find a good image until he noticed Mick Jagger sitting by himself looking bored, the world’s least likely wallflower. “Madonna crossed the room and sat down next to him,” Jones recalls. “She started talking and he became quite animated. Then Tony Curtis came along and sat down at the same table on the other side and started monopolising Madonna. Jagger was on his own again and looked miserable.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/26/the-big-picture-when-madonna-snubbed-mick-jagger-oscars-party">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It sounds like a midlife crisis so visit your GP and focus on what you’ve achieved – not what you haven’t, says Mariella Frostrup</p><p><em><strong>The dilemma </strong>I’m a 49-year-old woman. I work hard, own a home and live a fairly good life. My problem is that I can’t help but feel regretful that I never had children. I can’t quite believe this is how my life turned out. When I was younger I ached for my own child.</em></p><p><em>I have a partner currently. We don’t live together, he’s younger than I am and quite possibly the loveliest man I’ve been in a relationship with. It’s too late for me to conceive now and IVF isn’t an option as we don’t have the money.

## Shibden Mill Inn, near Halifax: ‘Brave enough to be more than just another food pub’ – restaurant review

<p>There’s the fierce tang of ambition here, an early contender for snack of the year, and other acts of subversion</p><p><strong>Shibden Mill Inn, Shibden Mill Fold, Halifax (01422 365 840). Nibbles £4–£6; starters £6–£12; mains £14–£23; desserts £7–£9. Wines from £19 a bottle. Extensive gin and whisk</strong><strong>y selection</strong></p><p>There are many kinds of brave. Rescuing families from advancing Australian bush fires is definitely brave, as is calling out predatory men in the movie business for sexual harassment. Me, on a beach, in a tight-fitting pair of Speedos might also be described as brave, though in that instance what the word really means is: “There are things that once seen, cannot be unseen.” Bravery is about context. The bravery described in a gravy-slicked restaurant column, is unlikely to stand up well against, say, that of a man who decides a narwhal tusk will do as a defensive weapon against a homicidal maniac. But that doesn’t stop it being its own kind of brave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/26/shibden-mill-inn-halifax-more-than-another-food-pub-jay-rayner">Continue reading...</a>

The researchers found that stress prompts the production of a hormone that affects the melanocyte cells involved in making hair pigments. The scientists hope that this discovery will add to the understanding of how the depletion of stem cells contributes to ageing in general.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/26/the-five-factors-that-affect-early-grey-hair-stress-hormones-genetics-heredity-smoking-cancer-drugs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tesla, recent recruit to the $100bn club, must be hoping it will become as unassailable as the likes of Amazon and Apple</p><p>Even in our age of tech billionaires, Elon Musk’s potential pay packet from Tesla is eyecatching. If the Californian carmaker’s average market value stays above $100bn (£76bn) for six months, he will be eligible for stock options worth $350m. It breached the $100bn barrier last week, so the clock is ticking. If Musk can pump the manufacturer to a $650bn valuation, his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/22/elon-musk-on-road-to-50bn-payout-as-teslas-value-passes-100bn" title="">reward could reach $50bn</a>. That is not a typo: a five followed by 10 zeros.</p><p>So Musk doesn’t lack for motivation. This week will offer the first test of that new $100bn valuation, when Tesla joins Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft in a barrage of US tech companies reporting earnings for the last three months of 2019. If Wall Street analysts are to be believed, records will be sent tumbling by the tech giants’ numbers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/26/tech-giants-war-virus-recession-nothing-can-stop-growing">Continue reading...</a>
