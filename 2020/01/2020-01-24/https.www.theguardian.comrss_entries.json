O\u2019Brien exposed people to new experiences (movies, museum visits, videogames) then asked some of them to predict how much they\u2019d enjoy the same thing again, while others actually did do it again. To cut a long study short: people enjoy repeat experiences more than they predict they will. And not because they use the sameness to lull themselves into a comfortable trance, but because they discover new things they\u2019d missed first time around.

I was born in east London in the 1980s. I took inspiration from my dad who had more than his fair share of hard knocks, and was caught up in the polio epidemic of the 1950s.

Some of its kudos was earned by its deeper exploration of humanity and sophisticated ideas about post- and late-capitalist societies. But a lot of it was the appeal of Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, the starship Enterprise\u2019s captain \u2013 a capable negotiator, problem-solver and, when needed, sneaky badass. Sci-fi likes to fantasise about strong, reasonable leaders; Picard is possibly the ultimate. That his show\u2019s reboot has allowed him to go titular is a measure of the imaginary man.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/24/star-trek-picard-review-patrick-stewart-goes-guerrilla-in-skintight-velour\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/24/star-trek-picard-review-patrick-stewart-goes-guerrilla-in-skintight-velour", "date_published": "2020-01-24 09:00:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Bushfires, ash rain, dust storms and flash floods: two weeks in apocalyptic Australia", "description": "<p>As the country lurches painfully from one extreme weather to another, residents are fearful of what they will face next</p><p>In Australia this summer, talking about the weather inevitably leads to talking about the apocalypse.</p><p>\u201cWhen\u2019s the plague of locusts going to arrive?\u201d jokes one Sydney resident after hearing reports that her city is to receive another storm of giant hailstones on Friday afternoon, just a day after it sweltered in temperatures of 40C and toxic smoke kept people stuck indoors, away from the respite of the beach.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/24/bushfires-ash-rain-dust-storms-flash-floods-two-weeks-in-apocalyptic-australia\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/24/bushfires-ash-rain-dust-storms-flash-floods-two-weeks-in-apocalyptic-australia", "date_published": "2020-01-24 08:41:31+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "David Attenborough to appear at citizens' climate assembly", "description": "<p>People from across Britain will join TV host to discuss ways to cut emissions to zero by 2050</p><p>Sir David Attenborough will address members of the public who are taking part in the UK\u2019s first climate assembly this weekend.</p><p>The TV presenter and naturalist will appear in Birmingham, where the 110 members are meeting to address how to reduce emissions to zero by 2050, to thank them for taking part.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/david-attenborough-citizens-climate-assembly\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/24/david-attenborough-citizens-climate-assembly", "date_published": "2020-01-24 07:00:18+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Lost land: processing the Australian bushfires \u2013 a photo essay", "description": "<p>Australian photographer Aletheia Casey watched the bushfires in her home country in despair and produced these artworks using prints from her last visit there, reworking them to transfer her emotions into the images</p><p>The bushfires that continue to wreak havoc in Australia began in September last year and are the worst in recorded history.
