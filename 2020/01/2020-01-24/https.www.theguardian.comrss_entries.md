<p>The Juventus No 10 discusses his Polish heritage, nearly giving up on football and interest from Tottenham and Manchester United</p><p>Behind the mask is a boy. Just before Christmas 2016, Paulo Dybala missed Juventus’s last penalty in the Italian Super Cup final against Milan. It was still on his mind days later when, watching Gladiator, he had an idea. From that moment, he has celebrated every goal by putting his hand across his face, thumb and index finger extended to imitate a mask. It has been seen often – there have been 64 goals since, starting with a penalty in the next match – instantly identified as his. It is also, he says, “not just a celebration but a message”.</p><p>Juventus’s No 10 speaks softly; he is thoughtful and the mask is worn lightly but listening it becomes apparent it goes beyond celebration to become more meaningful, if subconsciously. He says it was inspired by the penalty and the film, that he “didn’t really think about” it as protection or some emotional shield. But in the way he explains it – in everything he says the morning after its latest outing – it is revealed as deeper.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/24/paulo-dybala-juventus-mask-manchester-united-tottenham">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Relocating the upper chamber to York could be good for Britain – but only if its composition and role are radically rethought</p><p>A news organisation that began life as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/gnm-archive/2002/jun/06/1" title="">Manchester Guardian</a> and whose roots lie firmly in Lancashire can hardly be expected to give an unqualified welcome to the government’s reported plan to move the House of Lords <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/19/house-of-lords-may-move-out-of-london-to-reconnect-with-public" title="">to the city of York</a>. The possibility of such a move is nevertheless a tantalising one for the whole of northern England. If it proves to be more than a passing gimmick, and if it is part of a pluralistic and interlocking attempt to modernise and devolve British government more generally, including to the north, it could also be an extremely <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/20/house-lords-north-york-mps-palace-westminster" title="">desirable one</a>.</p><p>These are hugely important caveats.

Billed as a return to the days when one could hop on and off, the rear doors of the buses are now kept shut because, with no bus conductors to sell tickets, too many passengers were dodging fares. It may have seemed a smart idea at the time.

Horn player who recorded prolifically and was considered the finest of his generation<p>Widely acclaimed as the finest horn player of his generation, Barry Tuckwell, who has died aged 88, brought to an often recalcitrant instrument a technical security and silken tone that set new standards. With his trademark moustache and goatee, he cut a genial, distinctive figure on the stage, mesmerising audiences with the style and quality of his playing.</p><p>A native of Australia, he left the southern hemisphere in 1950, taking various positions in Britain before joining the London Symphony Orchestra as principal horn in 1955, remaining with them until 1968, and acting for a number of years also as its director and then chairman.

Perhaps the Amazon boss, who was supposedly hacked by Mohammed bin Salman, will be more careful in future<p>Though my tears have yet to liquefy at news that Amazon’s boss, Jeff Bezos, was phone-hacked, there’s a certain dramatic irony to the idea of an accidental circular firing squad among the tech gods. In Norse mythology, a lot of the deities end up doing for each other, so there is vague precedent to Apple’s iPhone or whatever being Bezos’s achilles heel. It’s like an Elon Musk rocket containing the Google boss exploding on the launch pad, or Mark Zuckerberg getting brained by an Amazon drone.</p><p>Of course, what elevates the story of how Bezos’s underpanted selfies may have made their way into the public domain is the identity of the hacker, which the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/21/amazon-boss-jeff-bezoss-phone-hacked-by-saudi-crown-prince" title="">Guardian this week</a> suggested was probably none other than Saudi bear and human lumberjacker Mohammed bin Salman. From here on in, we will refer to the crown prince by his desired nickname “MBS”, which he has no idea sounds like a discount carpet warehouse on the ringroad, or the name slapped on the off-brand trainers your mum picked up at the supermarket, which she insists are exactly the same as the Nikes except for a couple of tiny bits that no one’s going to notice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/24/jeff-bezos-mohammed-bin-salman-whatsapp-hack-phone">Continue reading...</a>

Guardian photographer Don McPhee, who was based in Manchester, was there to capture the moment. Dotted over a nearly three km stretch of beach, the figures become by turns submerged and revealed by the ebb and flow of the tides. After being shown in Norway, Germany and Belgium, they were installed on Crosby Beach temporarily; but in 2007, the local council agreed for them to be on permanent show, where they remain today: rusting, barnacle-covered, but still staring at the horizon.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/24/buy-your-own-guardian-classic-photograph-an-antony-gormley-statue-merseyside">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many will run for the hills, but others find its squelchy fields, sluice gates and forlorn villages impossibly romantic</p><p><strong>What’s going for it?</strong> It takes a certain someone to love Romney Marsh. That someone happens to be me. Many will gaze at its landscape of squelchy flat fields, sluice gates and forlorn, atmospheric villages, and run for the hills, as they did for centuries. Some, though, will find them all impossibly romantic and fabulously attractive. The neighbourhood did seem to attract those certain someones: Noel Coward, for instance, or Edith Nesbit, seeking escape in a spot lifted above the day-to-day in its own existential universe. It’s hard to fathom exactly where Romney Marsh gets its particular character from. Its history of malarial marshes and smugglers’ haunts hangs about like a miasma. The blank landscape is peppered with remote medieval villages, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/oct/16/top-10-tiny-churches-in-the-uk" title="">astonishing churches, such as at Fairfield</a>, built on the riches of the wool trade, and flat-faced postwar bungalows, staring out to sea. Or perhaps it’s this landscape’s own peculiar geographical history that is so attractive, its sense of temporariness, of the mastery of nature. The fortunes of Romney Marsh and its inhabitants have risen and fallen with the tides, and the accumulation of silt and shingle. These flatlands, just north of Dungeness, were once the English Channel, the now redundant cliffs arcing miles from the sea, from Hythe to Rye. This patch of land has only been lent to Britain by the waves, and the waves might want it back some day.</p><p><strong>The case against</strong> Bleak.

<p>We don’t always need new distractions – there’s a value to experiencing something more than once</p><p>One of the less-noticed mysteries of human psychology is how many everyday activities we <em>don’t</em> seem to find boring. If you have a regular pub or favourite country walk, or you’re prone to listening to certain songs 20 times on repeat, you’d appear to be violating the principle of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/hedonic-adaptation" title="">“hedonic adaptation”</a>, which holds that, as pleasures grow familiar they stop delivering joy. After all, evolution designed us to find <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2012/01/24/winifred-gallagher-new/" title="">novelty</a> compelling – on the prehistoric savannah, new things posed more threats, and opportunities, than old – and the modern economy relentlessly exploits this fact. People who prefer repeat experiences are liable to incur disdain. Maybe it’s forgivable, given the state of the news, that I’ve been re-rereading Sherlock Holmes recently, instead of current affairs, or cutting-edge literary fiction. But you probably wouldn’t say it was admirable. Ultimately, it feels like retreating from reality.</p><p>So I was pleased to encounter new <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-14793-001" title="">research</a> by Ed O’Brien of the University of Chicago, which might prompt a rethink on the matter. O’Brien exposed people to new experiences (movies, museum visits, videogames) then asked some of them to predict how much they’d enjoy the same thing again, while others actually did do it again. To cut a long study short: people enjoy repeat experiences more than they predict they will. And not because they use the sameness to lull themselves into a comfortable trance, but because they discover new things they’d missed first time around. As O’Brien put it: “Doing something once may engender an inflated sense that one has now seen ‘it’, leaving people naive to the missed nuances remaining to enjoy.” It’s less a question of loving the familiar, then, than of discovering it wasn’t so familiar after all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/24/do-you-love-doing-the-same-thing-over-and-over-heres-why-it-doesnt-make-you-boring">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The singer emerges as charming and undeniably talented in this Netflix documentary but it’s too slick for genuine insight</p><p>It’s safe to say that by the end of Miss Americana, a quickie documentary on the recent trials and tribulations of Taylor Swift opening this year’s Sundance film festival, few positions will have truly shifted. Those who already idolised the award-winning musician will continue to do so, as will the non-fans who might still begrudgingly admire her undeniable talent. And those who have questioned her knack for playing the victim as well as her lack of self-awareness will also find their minds similarly unchanged. Here is a character study authored by the character who’s being studied, a carefully controlled continuation of a story we have been following now for years.

<p>James Corden may be at the wheel, but it turns out the car in his all-singing, all-driving show is actually towed by a truck. Where’s the danger now? And will we ever get over the shock?</p><p>Everything you know is a lie. Yesterday, the world was shaken to its very foundations when a video of Justin Bieber taking part in James Corden’s Carpool Karaoke revealed that the whole thing is a sham, and James Corden doesn’t actually drive the car – rather, it’s towed by a truck.</p><p>Frankly, from this point onwards, up is down and down is up. Who knows what to believe any more? If Corden doesn’t really drive the car on Carpool Karaoke, then what else has he been lying to us about? Did he really write Gavin &amp; Stacey, or did he use a ghostwriter? Are the 1,000-year-old eggs he uses in Fill Your Guts or Spill Your Guts really 1,000 years old? Next he’ll be telling us that he isn’t even really a hideous dancing CGI cat. How dare he?

Over the past decade, the country has become a world leader on LGBTQ+ rights, from same-sex marriage and equal adoption, to liberal gender recognition laws for trans people. In fact, Malta was the first European country to protect people from discrimination based on gender identity or expression, and allows those who identify as neither man nor woman to use an “x” marker on official documents.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/malta-for-all/2020/jan/24/malta-for-all-the-lgbtq-guide-to-europes-most-inclusive-destination">Continue reading...</a>

I drew it on a piece of paper, then adapted a prosthetic I already had with a socket and a plectrum. It worked. I learned to play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lwlogyj7nFE" title="">Under The Bridge by Red Hot Chili Peppers</a>.

<p>Sci-fi’s most venerable hero returns to tackle the universe’s dodgy morals in a long-awaited comeback that’s solid – if not out of this world</p><p>Do you seek salvation and guidance? Are you hankering for a grownup who can sort everything out? Is leaving Earth and living in space increasingly tempting? Then 2020 might just be the right time for one of science fiction’s most venerable heroes to make a comeback.</p><p>Star Trek: Picard (Amazon Prime) is a sequel to Star Trek: The Next Generation, which ran from 1987 to 1994 and has less cultural currency than the inaugural 60s series, but is, for fans, an upgrade on the Shatner/Nimoy years. Some of its kudos was earned by its deeper exploration of humanity and sophisticated ideas about post- and late-capitalist societies. But a lot of it was the appeal of Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, the starship Enterprise’s captain – a capable negotiator, problem-solver and, when needed, sneaky badass. Sci-fi likes to fantasise about strong, reasonable leaders; Picard is possibly the ultimate. That his show’s reboot has allowed him to go titular is a measure of the imaginary man.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/24/star-trek-picard-review-patrick-stewart-goes-guerrilla-in-skintight-velour">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Australian photographer Aletheia Casey watched the bushfires in her home country in despair and produced these artworks using prints from her last visit there, reworking them to transfer her emotions into the images</p><p>The bushfires that continue to wreak havoc in Australia began in September last year and are the worst in recorded history. Years ago, I was trapped in a bushfire in the Hunter Valley, New South Wales. There were flames on either side of the highway and I only very narrowly made it through them safely. It was one of the most terrifying moments of my life. Yet the scale of that fire was nothing compared to those now burning throughout Australia, where it is estimated that more than 10m acres of land have been scorched. The country is literally choking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/24/lost-land-processing-the-australian-bushfires-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>

Hotspot follows 2013’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/04/pet-shop-boys-review" title="">Electric</a> and 2016’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/31/pet-shop-boys-super-cd-review-neil-tennant-chris-lowe-stuart-price" title="">Super</a>, all collaborations with producer <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/people/stuart-price" title="">Stuart Price</a>, all examples of the duo’s return to “electronic purism” after a succession of albums where, as Neil Tennant puts it, they variously “pretended to be a rock band” (Release), “made a zany one with everything and the kitchen sink on it” (Yes) and “went to LA and made an album about being old” (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/06/pet-shop-boys-elysium-review" title="">Elysium</a>).</p><p>“That was your big idea, being old,” says Tennant, nodding in the direction of his fellow Pet Shop Boy Chris Lowe, who is sitting alongside him on the sofa in a record company office in the City of London. “He explained that to our manager and she was absolutely aghast. She looked completely horrified.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/24/pet-shop-boys-the-acoustic-guitar-should-be-banned">Continue reading...</a>
