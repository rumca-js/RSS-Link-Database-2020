Footage is online of Charlie Woods playing golf but his father’s approach to privacy may mean that is the last we see for now<p>First there was the swing analysis. This 10-year-old’s move, reminiscent of Rory McIlroy in so many ways, earned gasps from across the world of golf. That Charlie Woods, son of arguably the greatest player of all time, seems a natural is probably no surprise at all. Yet a rare glimpse of the child, striking balls on a crowded range in south Florida, was sufficient to create a social media frenzy. That his doting dad, Tiger, was watching on made the scene all the more appealing. Photographs subsequently appeared showing Tiger caddying for Charlie in this junior event.</p><p>In the time since there have grown alternative sentiments. Is it fair, for instance, that the original film, filmed from behind trees and patently without the Woods clan knowing anything about it, exists at all? Is it a sad reality, rather than in any way endearing, that Charlie cannot enjoy the most simple of youthful pleasures without global focus? At the age of 10, regardless of the sporting legend by his side, nobody can be adequately prepared for these instances. Already, predictions are being made about the major-winning potential of Charlie Woods.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/13/tiger-woods-son-charlie-play-golf">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The clean-cut candidate for Labour-leader may suit the part of the Bridget Jones character, but is it a truth universally acknowledged?</p><p>It is a rumour that has been circulating for some time: Mark Darcy, of Bridget Jones fame, immortalised by Colin Firth, had a real-life prototype. Clean-cut and handsome, the image of self-control, taciturn to the point of humourlessness, but underneath possessed of a dry wit and a passionate humanist heart: plainly, he was based on Keir Starmer. The Sunday Times acknowledged this weekend that it wasn’t the first to float the idea – it has been put to Starmer before and he said he had no idea. Helen Fielding has also been asked about it and demurred to confirm or deny.</p><p>Surely we can figure this out by a process of elimination: Bridget Jones’s Diary, the novel, was published in 1996, although the character was created by Fielding for a newspaper column a couple of years beforehand. This was around the time of Starmer’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/16/foodanddrink" title="">famous hot-lawyer case</a> – defending the little guys, environmentalists Helen Steel and David Morris, against the ultimate corporate behemoth, McDonald’s, which sued them over a leaflet they distributed criticising the company’s practices. Before the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/feb/16/foodanddrink" title="">McLibel case</a>, Starmer already had solid David-and-Goliath credentials: he acted as a legal observer at the Wapping strikes in the mid-80s and represented the NUM. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2020/jan/13/was-mark-darcy-based-on-keir-starmer-heres-the-definitive-answer">Continue reading...</a>

## How Eleven’s punk makeover turned Stranger Things upside down

<p>Netflix’s smash hit was the perfect mix of nostalgia, horror and pure escapism, until the silliness of season two’s seventh episode ruined everything</p><p>Nostalgia is a supremely powerful thing. What other force is strong enough to make otherwise rational people spaff astronomical wads on cute mini-Mega Drives, or crap Casio watches that don’t even have the internet, or tickets to watch an exhausted four-fifths of the Spice Girls each pretend to like the other three-fifths? With the world being the steaming pile of Mogg that it is, nostalgia’s grip on modern society is hardly surprising. We need that escapism to whoosh us back somewhere warm, somewhere safe, to a simpler, more innocent time when uni was free, and “Piers Morgan” was just something a gentleman might say to a body artist when he wanted a Prince Albert. When Stranger Things arrived on Netflix, less than a month after the referendum result in 2016, it was as if all our prayers had been answered. Here was nostalgia, weaponised, and crikey-o-blimey we needed it.</p><p>You don’t need a huge precis on what it’s about, because you watched it. Everybody did. It was a global sensation for a litany of reasons: that lovable cast of goofy teens, none of whom – and this is rare with teens on TV – were so annoying you wanted to push them down a ravine. There was a redemptive, twitchy performance from Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown’s star-making turn as Eleven, the oafish brilliance of David Harbour’s Hopper, and the resplendent hair-acting of Joe Keery as jock-turned-geek hero Steve. The plot was a deft blend of schlocky scares, Lynch-lite mystery and coming-of-age triumphs and failures. And, most vitally of all, knitted throughout was a sense of nostalgia so tangible that it made you pine for a lost childhood you never even had – one of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Chopper bikes, CB radios and teeth-braces so vast you could grate pumpkins on them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/jump-the-shark-stranger-things">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Breakfast or brunch couldn’t be simpler – just islands of fried eggs in a pan of cubed potatoes with perfectly crisped edges</p><p>After his citrus cookery demonstration, the Sicilian chef <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ChefsTableNetflix/videos/1618572714844958/?t=0" title="">Corrado Assenza</a> asked us, a room of about 20 people, if there were any questions. I put my hand up into the lemony air. A young man near me did not: he simply shot out his question like a bullet, and it was the same question as mine. Corrado noticed, but I turned my keen arm into a “it’s fine” wave, so he answered the man, ending with thanks for a good question, before turning back to me. Acknowledging that my question had been answered would have been the sensible thing to do, but petty rage isn’t sensible. Being sensible also felt like giving the upper hand to the usurper, so I grabbed a thought: “What is your comfort food?” translating it as it came out of my mouth (<em>cos’e il tuo comfort cibo?</em>).</p><p>Not only did the question feel wrong and twee, it was also a bad translation that didn’t make any sense. Even if I had got it right (<em>qual è il tuo cibo di conforto?</em>), it doesn’t have quite the same meaning. The situation was further confused when someone else asked if I meant comfort in terms of <em>comodità</em>, as in “convenient” or “easy”. Fortunately, Corrado understood what I was getting at; it depended on when I asked him, he said: “Different moments called for completely different sorts of comfort.” He also suggested that maybe the reason there is no need for the term comfort food in Italian is because the words are one and the same: food is comfort.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/13/fried-potatoes-eggs-recipe-rachel-roddy-comfort-food">Continue reading...</a>

It would only appear during erections. “It was like the skin wasn’t stretching because something was holding it back,” the 49-year-old recalls. Soon, he began experiencing pains in the night. Then his penis developed a bend. “I thought: ‘That’s not right – what’s that about?’”</p><p>Jones, who has chosen not to use his real name, did what any concerned middle-aged person would: he researched his symptoms online.

<p>Corners of Europe far from any airport have been forgotten by modern travellers … but they make perfect short break destinations by train. We pick three in Burgundy, the Austrian Alps and the Dutch coast</p><p>With each passing year, the opening of new air routes reshapes our mental map of Europe. Once-favoured way stations on rail and ferry itineraries from England to the Alps have slipped from visibility. Areas on the near continent previously feted by English artists and writers are now bypassed. Where in the past an Italian grand tour might have included a few nights along the way in the Moselle or Rhine valleys, today’s travellers jet directly to their main destination. As recently as the 1960s, many travellers to Savoy might have stopped en route in the Jura (straddling the French-Swiss border), and the Vosges region to its north was a popular stepping stone en route to the Black Forest.</p><p>But the rail routes of yesteryear are still there: across Europe myriad small towns, often distant from the smaller airports that serve budget airlines, make perfect short-break destinations for those inclined to take the train.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jan/13/rail-itineraries-europe-tarian-holidays-austria-netherlands-coast-france-burgundy-vineyards">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In six years Guardian Cities has grown into a community of journalists, experts and readers joined by a desire to make cities better. Now it’s time for a change</p><p>Since its founding six years ago, Guardian Cities has grown from a small experiment into a huge community. Together – as editors, writers, photographers and film-makers, along with architecture experts, urban planners, gentrification activists, cycling evangelists, canalboat dwellers, homeless people, theatre-makers, refugees and the rest of a motley crew of contributors and readers from nearly 600 cities – we have tried to shape how the world understands urbanisation: namely, as one of the truly transformative global phenomena of the 21st century.</p><p>We started Guardian Cities because we saw that everywhere on Earth, people were flooding into cities. More concrete was poured in the last couple of years in China than the US used in the entire 20th century. China <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/20/china-100-cities-populations-bigger-liverpool">now has</a> 100 cities with more than 1 million people, while some developing megalopolises in Africa and elsewhere may hit 80 million residents; the 100 million city <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/19/urban-explosion-kinshasa-el-alto-growth-mexico-city-bangalore-lagos">is no longer a fantastical proposition</a>.

The media are again playing both sides in a debate that is never intended to address injustice<p>It’s pantomime season again. Is Britain racist? Oh no it’s not. Oh yes it is! The script is ready – all we need is to find new stars, maybe update the rest of the cast here and there.

Is it “100% racist”? Or is it definitely racist, yes, 100%?</p><p>The headlines were already well rehearsed. “‘100% wrong!’ Sajid Javid hits out at Stormzy over claims the UK is a ‘racist country’”, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/1220032/stormzy-britain-racist-comments-sajid-javid-boris-johnson-corbyn-labour" title="">said the Daily Express</a>. Javid has become a key character in these national circuses, cooing out denials with a robotic chirpiness on Twitter.

<p>Writing down the good things that have happened during the day, getting out into nature and setting realistic goals can all help you achieve a more positive outlook</p><p>Many of us would like to be happier, but there is no quick fix. “I would argue that becoming upbeat is an action,” says <a href="https://twitter.com/mjrendall?lang=en" title="">Dr Melanie Rendall</a>, the principal clinical psychologist at the Homerton University Hospital NHS foundation trust. “It is learning to take that small step in a direction that moves us towards what is important to us, and making space on that journey for a mind that will invariably throw all sorts of nonsense at us to send us off course.” Pressure to feel a certain way – what Rendall calls the “shoulds, oughts and musts” of a goal-oriented culture and relentless self-comparison – can lead us further away from what we truly value and what might really make us happy. So, rather than aiming to be happy in the future, take little actions now that make you feel better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/13/five-ways-to-be-upbeat">Continue reading...</a>

So she went to lift some weights. “I was at peak dread,” she says. “So I was like, ‘Just do 20 minutes.’ Then I felt like doing another 20 minutes. That was the beginning of the reset. By the time I was on stage, I felt calm.”</p><p>Weightlifting has not only given Fostekew a way to boost her mood. It also inspired the standup show, now on tour, that has been causing all her nervousness. It’s called Hench, a term meaning strong and muscular. When a guy at the gym called Fostekew this one day when he saw her lifting, it threw her into a crisis.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/13/jessica-fostekew-hench-london-weightlifting-body-fascism-muscly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Fresh from winning a Golden Globe for his portrayal of media tycoon Logan Roy, the actor talks about class, cannabis and an odd royal encounter</p><p>Doing an interview over the phone can be a thankless job: lines get crossed, you awkwardly interrupt one another and, without the intimacy of a face to face encounter, it’s hard to get a sense of the other person. But doing a phone interview with Brian Cox – the acclaimed actor, that is, not the pop-star-turned-particle-physicist with the same name – is such a hoot that if we met in person I would have probably dissolved into a puddle of hysteria.</p><p>“No, no, not now, I’m having an important conversation!” he barks when someone has the temerity to try to enter his hotel room 45 minutes into our chat. “So where was I? Ah yes …” And he launches back into the anecdote about the time Princess Margaret felt him up. The man has so much charisma – and so many anecdotes – to burn, I can practically feel my phone melting against my face.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/successions-brian-cox-i-was-touched-up-by-princess-margaret">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The BBC drama about the Profumo scandal upends the conventional narrative by offering us women’s perspectives</p><p>In the second episode of the BBC drama <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ct76" title="">The Trial of Christine Keeler</a>, the voice of its eponymous heroine reflects on the liaison that came to define the sexual liberation era, and arguably brought down the Tory government. “We both gave in to the most natural human instinct of all,” she says, wryly. “The love of a powerful middle-aged man for a penniless teenage girl.”</p><p>Keeler was 19 when she started sleeping with John Profumo, the 46-year-old married secretary of state for war, kicking off a scandal that would become a defining cultural landmark, as implacable in the historiography of the 1960s as Lady Chatterley and the Beatles. To those of us who are too young to have lived through it, our awareness of it was less keen: a collection of vaguely remembered names, an iconic photograph of a naked young woman straddling a knock-off Arne Jacobsen chair, a swimming pool and a stately home, something about Russia.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/13/metoo-christine-keeler-bbc-drama-profumo-women">Continue reading...</a>
