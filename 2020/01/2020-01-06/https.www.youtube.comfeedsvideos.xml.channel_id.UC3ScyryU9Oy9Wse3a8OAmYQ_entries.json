It was, he says, a tough order: \u201cI mean, none of us were happy about it,\u201d he tells FRONTLINE. \u201cBut everybody around me was just doing exactly what\u2026 We were all told to do this.\u201d\n\nExperts say the tactic causes lasting trauma. In the above excerpt from the FRONTLINE documentary \"Targeting El Paso,\" Farris tells FRONTLINE about the effects he witnessed on a child during the last family separation he conducted.\n\n\u201cIt was a young boy. I think he was about two. The world was upside down to that kid,\u201d Farris says. \u201cSo when the contractor tried to take him away, he reached for me and he climbed up on me again, and he was holding on to me. So that that one got me a little bit.\u201d\n\nAfter that, Farris says he drew the line: \u201cI said at that one, \u2018I\u2019m not doing this anymore. I won\u2019t do it. I went back to the supervisor and I told him, \u2018Don\u2019t assign me to do that anymore.\u2019\u201d\n\nFarris didn\u2019t complain up the chain, but told FRONTLINE he wanted to.\n\nFor more on Farris's story -- and how the El Paso area became a testing ground for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration policies -- stream \"Targeting El Paso\" in full starting Tues., Jan. 7: https://to.pbs.org/2Fnq6Io\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\n\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \n\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

Now, nine-year-old Dariana becomes the first child held inside the Clint facility who has been known to speak to the media: \"Maybe we\u2019d go out about 15 minutes a day ... the rest of the time we were locked up,\" she tells FRONTLINE in this excerpt from \"Targeting El Paso.\"\n\r\nSubscribe on YouTube: http://bit.ly/1BycsJW\r\n\r\nThe nine-year-old girl doesn\u2019t remember exactly when she was separated from her father after they crossed the border into the United States. But she does remember the color of the uniforms of the armed guards at Clint: \u201cThey were green,\u201d she tells FRONTLINE. \u201cGreen, but they had guns in their holsters.\u201d\n\nThere were no adults caring for her, she says \u2014 only cameras.\n\r\nFor more on Dariana's story -- and on how the El Paso area became a testing ground for some of the Trump administration's most controversial immigration policies -- stream \"Targeting El Paso\" in full starting Tues., Jan. 7: https://to.pbs.org/2Fnq6Io\n\r\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/frontlinepbs\r\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/frontlinepbs\r\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/frontline\r\n\r\nFRONTLINE is streaming more than 200 documentaries online, for free, here: http://to.pbs.org/hxRvQP \r\n\r\nFunding for FRONTLINE is provided through the support of PBS viewers and by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
