<p>The still boyish choirmaster has turned many unlikely people into singers in his time, but a young offender institution is his most daunting challenge yet. There will be tears</p><p>It has been 14 years since Gareth Malone first appeared on our screens. In that time he has coaxed a number of unlikely groups not just to sing, but to perform: teenage boys, residents of the South Oxhey housing estate, some military wives. Now, in The Choir: Aylesbury Prison (BBC Two), he is back to do the same with young offenders.</p><p>One might, at this stage, take it as read that he will succeed. Malone, still boyish but now greying and – if you can believe it – 44, has a reputation for not failing at this sort of thing. The formula is reliable and repeatable. But Her Majesty’s Young Offenders Institute Aylesbury is a very particular case.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/06/the-choir-aylesbury-prison-review-gareth-malone-goes-behind-bars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The radio DJ is now very much enlightened. So can we all become millionaires like him if we devote ourselves to Eckhart Tolle and learn the power of ‘I’?</p><p>How would any of us know it was new year if the papers weren’t full of articles about how to improve ourselves written by people so clueless about life that they opted for the media as a long-term career? Such guidance has been especially prevalent this year, maybe because it’s a new decade or maybe because these kinds of articles are a lot easier and cheaper to produce than proper investigative journalism – who really can say? But I would like to draw everyone’s attention to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/chris-evans-the-moment-i-saw-the-light-and-turned-my-life-around-0xxbm7r9g" title="">one article</a> published over the weekend, about how we can all lead better lives, written by none other than British radio’s own Chris Evans (as opposed to Hollywood’s own Chris Evans). Because, truly, no one is better qualified to give life guidance than a man who, in 2000, at the age of 34, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-407792/Billie-Piper-Chris-Evans-saved-life.html" title="">gave the then 18-year-old Billie Piper a silver Ferrari</a>, even though she didn’t know how to drive.</p><p>Ah, but that’s all very much in the past, Evans assures us, because he is now ENLIGHTENED. He proves this at some length in an article that itself seems to defy the very notion of space and time, with observations including: “Newton saw his falling apple one day and declared: ‘Look! Gravity!’ That was his identity that day, he became the gravity guy. But what about the tree whence the apple fell? The tree that had defied his gravity in the first place, rising skywards, majestically, towards the stars.” The headline on the article is I Have Seen the Light, but the editors could have saved themselves a few characters and just titled it, more accurately, Made Ya Think.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/06/myself-is-not-my-i-today-what-can-we-learn-from-chris-evans-extraordinary-life-advice">Continue reading...</a>

## Stop mewling! Cats is no turkey, say our dance and theatre critics

<p>Film reviewers sank their claws into Cats, but is it really so awful? Our stage reviewers steeled themselves for the caterwauling ... but ended up quite enjoying it </p><p>It can be very pleasurable as a critic to really get your claws into something, but the landslide of snide that met the Cats movie didn’t tally with the film I saw. In fact, I was baffled by the mass freakout. Again and again, critics were confounded by the idea of humans dressed up as cats. But what were they expecting? Had anyone seen the musical?! The cats in the film look like a more sophisticated version of the stage dancers in their catsuits. Like all dancers, they have person-shaped bodies (including boobs, where appropriate) and smoothed over knobbly bits. (This obsession with them having no visible genitals – it would be a lot weirder if they did, no?) The CGI ears and tails have elicited some cattiness, but they’re twitchily intriguing rather than disturbing.<br /><br />The film’s supposed “sexiness” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/20/cats-dirty-secret-horny-romp-musical-human-feline">has got reviewers in a fervour</a>, but I think there’s some confusion. Cats are sensual beasts, they slink about and stretch luxuriously; dancers have physical freedom and self-possession. If that turns you on, well good for you, but it’s hardly X-rated.<br /><br />Cats is far from a perfect film. Yes, the plot’s flimsy, it’s nowhere near as funny as it wants to be, nor as poignant – although Jennifer Hudson gets the payoff with her final chorus – but it’s a perfectly entertaining musical. Director Tom Hooper’s main mistake may have been to not completely embrace the full-on song-and-dance fest that this show is. All the best moments are those of mounting harmonies gathering steam and the few unapologetic dance numbers.<br /><br />Andy Blankenbuehler’s choreography has catty quirks, bits of ballet, Broadway and street dance, but it doesn’t always have space to really set out its vision. The amazing cast of world-class dancers, including Francesca Hayward, Robbie Fairchild, Les Twins and Steven McRae, are often relegated to the background and we don’t see half of what they can do – or they’re on wires, which makes their dancing look oddly unreal. Incidentally, the original choreographer signed up to the film was the much more avant-garde Wayne McGregor (he pulled out citing scheduling conflicts), which would have made it a very different film.<br /><br />Perhaps Cats just didn’t click with film critics because it’s a show in love with the myths and magic of theatre: the velvet drapes and faded glamour, the names in lights, the stars and the gutter; the band of misfits united in pursuit of the perfect number; the spotlight as saviour. And then there’s the most essential theatrical element of all: suspension of disbelief. <strong>Lyndsey Winship</strong></p><p>A zero-star review initially scared me off Cats; then came reports of CGI (non) genitals. It sounded like a disaster on a scale as epic as Performance and maybe as obscene. Having grown up reading TS Eliot’s Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats, and considering Andrew Lloyd Webber’s stage show to be musical-theatre perfection, I thought I’d be delivering a similarly damning verdict when I finally saw it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/06/cats-not-a-bad-movie">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Key figures from major US newspapers, news sites and TV describe their fears about covering this year’s election – and ideas on how to get it right</p><p>In the weeks after the election of Donald Trump in 2016, the American media went through deep soul searching. Most news outlets had been taken by surprise by Trump’s victory, had failed to see the rise of the electorate that would put him in the White House, and had been led by the clickbait of his tweets. Then there was Hillary Clinton’s emails and an arguable failure to appreciate the importance of misinformation and Russian interference in the election.</p><p>This time the press has pledged to do better. Yet, with less than a year to go before Americans go to the polls again, there are already signs that mistakes of the magnitude of 2016 may be repeated or new challenges arise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/06/sleepwalking-into-2020-media-missed-donald-trump-rise-lessons-learned-2016">Continue reading...</a>

I felt fat long before I truly had a fat body, but eventually the latter caught up with the former. I tried to diet on and off from my late teens to my late 30s, but nothing stuck. I was deeply, painfully unhappy.</p><p>I didn’t have a boyfriend throughout my 20s. Then, aged 30, I met my now ex-husband online, but that relationship was not without its complexities and I continued to gain weight. We got married in 2008. When we split up in 2013, I lost control and lived on junk food for a summer. I have always been an emotional eater and it was a vicious cycle. I was unhappy because I was fat, I ate because I was unhappy, then I gained weight because I ate.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/06/how-weight-loss-surgery-saved-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

## Arnaud Desplechin: 'Theatre is for the bourgeois. Film is the art of rascals!'

<p>The revered film director vowed never to touch theatre. So why is he staging the great Aids epic Angels in America? Apparently, it’s all a misunderstanding</p><p>Arnaud Desplechin looks surprisingly calm as he excuses himself to listen to a voicemail from the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/17/inside-the-comedie-francaise-the-damned-ivo-van-hove">Comédie-Française</a>’s technical team. France is one week into a general strike over pension reform and the country’s premier theatre company has followed suit, resulting in cancelled performances and rehearsals. “We take it day by day,” says Desplechin, whose new production of <a href="https://www.comedie-francaise.fr/en/events/angels-in-america-19-20">Angels in America</a> is due to open in mid-January. “It will start to get difficult if it continues.” We spoke in December and the strike is still going strong, but there is no plan to delay.</p><p>It doesn’t help that Tony Kushner’s sprawling 1990s play about the Aids crisis is only Desplechin’s second theatre project, his first being a 2015 version of <a href="https://www.comedie-francaise.fr/en/events/pere15-16">August Strindberg’s Father</a>. The 59-year-old auteur is renowned for such character-driven screen dramas as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2005/jun/10/2">Kings and Queen</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/15/my-golden-days-review-arnaud-desplechin">My Golden Days</a>, which often draw on his own life and background.

<p>The number of women being convicted for violent crimes has increased significantly over the past three decades</p><p>Men commit more crimes than women do. A lot more. This holds true over time and across cultures. In America, the incarceration capital of the world (over 2 million detainees), males comprise 93% of the prison population. Men also account for 73% of all arrests and 80% of those charged with violent crimes. This disparity between the sexes is particularly stark when it comes to murder: 90% of the time, the ones who do the killing are men.</p><p>All these numbers add up to what criminologists call the “gender gap”. But read enough academic <a href="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1168351/FULLTEXT01.pdf">journals </a>and government crime <a href="https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/femof.pdf">reports</a>, and some curious facts emerge: while crime rates in the western world have steadily declined over the past three decades, the number of young women being convicted for violent crimes in some western countries has increased significantly; law enforcement records indicate the opposite is true for their male counterparts. In other words, the gender gap is closing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/06/female-fugitives-women-crime-rates-rise">Continue reading...</a>

## Five ways to cure and prevent chapped lips

<p>Dietary supplements may work and the right lip balm is useful – but avoid licking</p><p>Chapped lips are common in winter, says Daniel Glass, a consultant dermatologist at <a href="https://www.thedermatologyclinic.london/" title="">the Dermatology Clinic</a>, because of exposure to cold air outside and dry, centrally heated air inside. “Keratin, which forms the top layer of your skin, loses its flexibility and the lips become sore, cracked and scaly,” he says. “Many patients who have chapped lips are lip-lickers. Repeated licking can remove the oily surface film that protects the lips from losing moisture, leading to lips cracking. The digestive enzymes in saliva can also irritate the lips.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/06/five-ways-to-cure-and-prevent-chapped-lips">Continue reading...</a>

She signed off on the repossession of her home in Surrey and moved to London, close to friends, into a “gorgeous, French-style apartment, with flowers and plants everywhere and so much light,” she says, eyes widening. She had 12 months of trauma therapy, which she describes as “the best gift I ever gave myself”. And she won one of the leading roles in the West End production of the musical <a href="https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2019/nicola-roberts-cit-of-angels/" title="">City of Angels</a>, which opens in March.</p><p>We meet at a canalside bar in London just before Christmas. “Prior to this year, I’d say I had five of the unhappiest years of my life.

I was kind of ground down.” Roberts says that just two years ago she would not merely have lacked the confidence to audition for her new role – “I actually would have been terrified for it to be in the public domain that I was going to be in the same space every night, because I was fearful for my safety”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/06/nicola-roberts-my-therapist-said-i-was-one-of-the-most-resilient-people-shed-ever-met">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ed Pilkington hears from some of the most influential journalists in the US on how hard lessons were learned after their coverage of the 2016 election. But will 2020 really be any different? Plus: Carol Anderson on voter suppression and the US election</p><p>Donald Trump’s election victory in 2016 came as a major shock to most news organisations in the US, which had all but anointed Hillary Clinton as the next president. But Trump’s ability to garner attention and break rules and norms had resulted in billions of dollars’ worth of free coverage, which he combined with an ability to wriggle out of serious scrutiny. </p><p>All this left a major challenge for how newsrooms across the US should cover his presidency, and how they should now cover his attempt to be re-elected. The Guardian US chief reporter, <strong>Ed Pilkington</strong>,<strong> </strong>has been working in partnership with the Columbia Journalism Review and spoken to 30 leading editors, reporters, TV executives and media commentators, asking for their reflections at the start of a year of election coverage.
