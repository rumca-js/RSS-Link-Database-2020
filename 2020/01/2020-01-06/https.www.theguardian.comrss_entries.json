Cats is no turkey, say our dance and theatre critics", "description": "<p>Film reviewers sank their claws into Cats, but is it really so awful? Our stage reviewers steeled themselves for the caterwauling ... but ended up quite enjoying it </p><p>It can be very pleasurable as a critic to really get your claws into something, but the landslide of snide that met the Cats movie didn\u2019t tally with the film I saw. In fact, I was baffled by the mass freakout. Again and again, critics were confounded by the idea of humans dressed up as cats. But what were they expecting? Had anyone seen the musical?! The cats in the film look like a more sophisticated version of the stage dancers in their catsuits. Like all dancers, they have person-shaped bodies (including boobs, where appropriate) and smoothed over knobbly bits. (This obsession with them having no visible genitals \u2013 it would be a lot weirder if they did, no?) The CGI ears and tails have elicited some cattiness, but they\u2019re twitchily intriguing rather than disturbing.<br /><br />The film\u2019s supposed \u201csexiness\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/20/cats-dirty-secret-horny-romp-musical-human-feline\">has got reviewers in a fervour</a>, but I think there\u2019s some confusion. Cats are sensual beasts, they slink about and stretch luxuriously; dancers have physical freedom and self-possession. If that turns you on, well good for you, but it\u2019s hardly X-rated.<br /><br />Cats is far from a perfect film. Yes, the plot\u2019s flimsy, it\u2019s nowhere near as funny as it wants to be, nor as poignant \u2013 although Jennifer Hudson gets the payoff with her final chorus \u2013 but it\u2019s a perfectly entertaining musical. Director Tom Hooper\u2019s main mistake may have been to not completely embrace the full-on song-and-dance fest that this show is. All the best moments are those of mounting harmonies gathering steam and the few unapologetic dance numbers.<br /><br />Andy Blankenbuehler\u2019s choreography has catty quirks, bits of ballet, Broadway and street dance, but it doesn\u2019t always have space to really set out its vision. The amazing cast of world-class dancers, including Francesca Hayward, Robbie Fairchild, Les Twins and Steven McRae, are often relegated to the background and we don\u2019t see half of what they can do \u2013 or they\u2019re on wires, which makes their dancing look oddly unreal. Incidentally, the original choreographer signed up to the film was the much more avant-garde Wayne McGregor (he pulled out citing scheduling conflicts), which would have made it a very different film.<br /><br />Perhaps Cats just didn\u2019t click with film critics because it\u2019s a show in love with the myths and magic of theatre: the velvet drapes and faded glamour, the names in lights, the stars and the gutter; the band of misfits united in pursuit of the perfect number; the spotlight as saviour. And then there\u2019s the most essential theatrical element of all: suspension of disbelief. <strong>Lyndsey Winship</strong></p><p>A zero-star review initially scared me off Cats; then came reports of CGI (non) genitals. It sounded like a disaster on a scale as epic as Performance and maybe as obscene. Having grown up reading TS Eliot\u2019s Old Possum\u2019s Book of Practical Cats, and considering Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s stage show to be musical-theatre perfection, I thought I\u2019d be delivering a similarly damning verdict when I finally saw it.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/06/cats-not-a-bad-movie\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/06/cats-not-a-bad-movie", "date_published": "2020-01-06 15:00:39+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Dominic Cummings not allowed to directly hire civil servants \u2013\u00a0No 10", "description": "<p>PM\u2019s chief adviser called for \u2018weirdos and misfits\u2019 to email him directly about jobs</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jan/06/labour-leadership-jess-phillips-clarifies-brexit-stance-saying-she-cant-see-party-backing-remain-at-next-election-live-news\">Latest politics news \u2013 live updates</a></li></ul><p>Boris Johnson\u2019s chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, will not be allowed to bypass Whitehall\u2019s usual recruitment processes when recruiting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\">\u201cweirdos</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\">\u201d and </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/02/dominic-cummings-calls-for-weirdos-and-misfits-for-no-10-jobs\">\u201cmisfits</a>\u201d for Downing Street jobs, No 10 has said.</p><p> Cummings has been criticised by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/03/dominic-cummings-call-for-no-10-staff-may-break-employment-law\">employment lawyers</a> and unions after posting a rambling <a href=\"https://dominiccummings.com/2020/01/02/two-hands-are-a-lot-were-hiring-data-scientists-project-managers-policy-experts-assorted-weirdos/\">2,900-word blogpost</a> calling for people with \u201codd skills\u201d to circumvent the usual rules in applying for jobs as special advisers and officials in government.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/dominic-cummings-not-allowed-to-directly-hire-civil-servants-no-10\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/06/dominic-cummings-not-allowed-to-directly-hire-civil-servants-no-10", "date_published": "2020-01-06 14:13:36+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Supersized sleeves: stars opt for big puffs at the Golden Globes", "description": "<p>Beyonc\u00e9, Jodie Comer and Olivia Colman set the tone for exuberant armwear at this year\u2019s awards \u2013 a far cry from 2018\u2019s Time\u2019s Up solidarity black outfits</p><p>Whether <a href=\"https://variety.com/2019/film/news/golden-globe-nominations-female-director-snub-1203429487/\">snubbing female directors</a> or <a href=\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/diversity-scrutinized-as-golden-globes-honors-white-winnersawkaa-1266938\">people of colour</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/golden-globes-2020-1917-and-fleabag-lead-british-invasion-with-major-wins\">this year\u2019s Golden Globes</a> did not represent culture at its most progressive.
