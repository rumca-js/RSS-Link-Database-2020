how can we really milk the sh*t out of this?

goop is an American natural health company owned by actress Gwyneth Paltrow. it shares a lot in common with a familiar conspiracy theorist in terms of sketchy product development, but without the conspiracy talking points.

It was launched as a "lifestyle brand" by Paltrow in September 2008, beginning as a weekly e-mail newsletter providing new age advice, such as "police your thoughts" and "eliminate white foods", and the slogan "Nourish the Inner Aspect". A lifestyle website was later added, and then Goop expanded into e-commerce, collaborating with fashion brands, launching pop-up shops, holding a "wellness summit", launching a print magazine, a podcast, and a docuseries for Netflix.

They have been widely critized for their pseudoscientific products and articles, such as this one from Anthony William, a "medical medium" with no credentials: https://goop.com/wellness/health/the-medical-medium-on-the-origins-of-thyroid-cancer/
