As in any good drama, things are bubbling up as the final act approaches. England need eight more wickets to level the series, which makes them favourites but not a sure thing. South Africa need 312 runs, which is the longest of long shots, but not unthinkable. Failing that, the South Africans have to bat out the day \u2013 though if they get a sniff of a draw, the chance of a win will be there to tempt them into an indiscretion or two. With England relying on two elderly seamers and a rookie spinner, and South Africa leaning rather too heavily on a debutant opener, it\u2019s all deliciously intriguing. And let\u2019s not forget that if some people get their way, days like this will soon be a distant memory.</p><p>England were given a late boost by Jimmy Anderson, looking himself again and taking his sixth wicket of the match, to see off Zubayr Hamza. But that was only England\u2019s second wicket in 56 overs. Today they need to nab one every 11 overs, which means being more than twice as incisive when their attack is missing both its high pace (Jofra Archer, Mark Wood) and its battle-hardened spin (Moeen Ali). Joe Root has to stop Pieter Malan going the whole Dom Sibley, while also making sure that neither Faf du Plessis nor Quinton de Kock hits a hundred \u2013 a feat that, in a plot twist nobody saw coming, only Sibley has managed in this series.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/07/south-africa-v-england-second-test-day-five-live\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/07/south-africa-v-england-second-test-day-five-live", "date_published": "2020-01-07 07:30:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Australia fires live: NSW and Victoria bushfires insurance bill tops $700m \u2013 latest updates", "description": "<p>Rain falls on some NSW, Victorian and South Australian bushfire-affected areas, but worse fire conditions are forecast to return.
