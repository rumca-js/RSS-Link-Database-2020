<p>The forced publication of the gap between chief executive and average pay is a fudged compromise</p><p>A lot of faith is being invested in the idea that the arrival of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/01/uk-biggest-listed-companies-forced-to-reveal-executive-worker-pay-gap-new-rules">pay ratios</a> – meaning the mandatory publication of the gap between the chief executive’s rewards and those of the average earner in a company – represents a game-changer. Andrea Leadsom, the business secretary, called the legislation, which applies from this year to companies with more than 250 employees, “world-leading”. Peter Cheese, chief executive at the Centre Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), thinks 2020 “is the first year where businesses are really being held to account on executive pay”.</p><p>Believe that latter claim when you see it. Forcing pay ratios into the open doesn’t change anything in itself.

As in any good drama, things are bubbling up as the final act approaches. England need eight more wickets to level the series, which makes them favourites but not a sure thing. South Africa need 312 runs, which is the longest of long shots, but not unthinkable. Failing that, the South Africans have to bat out the day – though if they get a sniff of a draw, the chance of a win will be there to tempt them into an indiscretion or two. With England relying on two elderly seamers and a rookie spinner, and South Africa leaning rather too heavily on a debutant opener, it’s all deliciously intriguing. And let’s not forget that if some people get their way, days like this will soon be a distant memory.</p><p>England were given a late boost by Jimmy Anderson, looking himself again and taking his sixth wicket of the match, to see off Zubayr Hamza. But that was only England’s second wicket in 56 overs. Today they need to nab one every 11 overs, which means being more than twice as incisive when their attack is missing both its high pace (Jofra Archer, Mark Wood) and its battle-hardened spin (Moeen Ali). Joe Root has to stop Pieter Malan going the whole Dom Sibley, while also making sure that neither Faf du Plessis nor Quinton de Kock hits a hundred – a feat that, in a plot twist nobody saw coming, only Sibley has managed in this series.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/jan/07/south-africa-v-england-second-test-day-five-live">Continue reading...</a>

A daughter’s complicity in her mother’s secret adulterous affair is gruesomely fascinating<p>One summer night in 1980, Adrienne Brodeur was woken up by her self-obsessed, larger-than-life mother, Malabar; Adrienne was then a 14-year-old schoolgirl, her mother a cookery writer in her late 40s. What was the problem? In a state of high excitement, Malabar whispered her confession: “Ben Souther just kissed me.” Sounding like a teenager, she repeated herself: “I still can’t believe it. He kissed me, Rennie.”</p><p>In the seconds that followed, a Faustian pact was struck between parent and child. Brodeur tacitly agreed to help facilitate the affair on which her mother was about to embark, even though the man in question was her beloved stepfather’s best friend. “You deserve this,” she reassured Malabar, as if they were college friends talking of new boyfriends over a bottle of cheap chardonnay. In return, she was duly elevated to the position of Malabar’s confidante-in-chief, a role she longed for, in spite of the likelihood that it would involve lying to everyone. How else could she hope to get nearer to the centre of Malabar’s world?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/07/wild-game-by-adrienne-brodeur-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I’m sick of films dominated by male characters and perspectives. This year I’m changing my cinematic diet<br /></p><p>Recently I seem to have developed a sort of allergic reaction to films. The symptoms are as follows: about an hour into watching almost any given movie, I find myself contorted with irritation, and begin muttering like a mad person: “But what about <em>her</em>? What does <em>she</em> have to say?” After a lifetime of happily sitting through films directed almost exclusively by men, this allergic reaction seems to be telling me I need a more balanced cultural diet.</p><p>Admittedly I have always been more of a book lover, but my husband is a cinema buff, and every so often he’ll try again at converting me. “This one is critically acclaimed,” he will say. “Tipped for an Oscar! I’m sure it will be fine. Just give it a go.” Most recently, we settled on Marriage Story, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/17/marriage-story-review-scarlett-johansson-adam-driver-noah-baumbach-best-film-yet" title="">almost universally praised film</a> by Noah Baumbach.

<p>A slow boat across the Atlantic plus a scenic train home to Vancouver add up to a hugely enjoyable three-week trip</p><p>‘Are you a crew member?” the security guard asked, fixing me with a stare in the van’s rear-view mirror. “Passenger,” I replied. The guard gave me a quizzical look then muttered something to himself in German, shaking his head. It was 7am and the port of Hamburg was a hive of activity, our port security van speeding past whirring cranes and towering stacks of shipping containers. As the ship’s immense hull came into view, I entered a world where everything was larger, louder and more dangerous than my life on land. The 300-metre, 100,000-tonne vessel before me was to be my home for the next 15 days.</p><p>Four months earlier I had made a reservation on a cargo ship to take me from Hamburg to Halifax, Nova Scotia. My European work visa was expiring and I hoped to make it home to the west coast of Canada in time for Christmas.

By Andrew Bacevich</p><p>‘Without the Cold War, what’s the point of being an American?” Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, the novelist John Updike’s late-20th-century everyman, posed that question just as the “long twilight struggle” was winding down. More than quarter of a century later, the plaintive query still awaits a definitive answer.</p><p>Indeed, the passage of time has only sown confusion about whether there is a point to being an American. Even as the cold war was ending, Updike’s everyman was not alone in feeling at a loss. By the 1980s, the cold war had become more than a mere situation or circumstance. It was a state of mind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/07/freedom-without-constraints-how-the-us-squandered-its-cold-war-victory">Continue reading...</a>
