He owes people hundreds of thousands of dollars that he will never return to them. He used a check cashing facility to cash my checks where he likely paid a 3-5% fee on $11,000 just to avoid using bank accounts because if he used a bank account the wages would be garnished to his past clients who are his creditors. His attempt to silence me through these privacy claims will allow him to continue doing what he did to me to other people. I can survive taking a $30,000 hit, but can the next victim?\n\n\nTo view the contract, https://imgur.com/a/fSjfmVf --- Eugene Harrington of Gotham City Solutions got off with about $30,000. Exact amounts listed. This was not the \"lowest bid\", this was the recommended/referred bid. The super of the building suggested contractors that bid about $12,000 less to do the job, but was inconsistent in his communication. It was worth the extra to be able to contact the person by phone, know they weren't going to run away, and because he had a referral from an ex-employer/mentor of mine. \n\nI chose to fire him because I can't trust any of the work he does to be of quality.\n\n\nLook below at the history. \n\nhttps://www.buildzoom.com/contractor/eugene-harrington - this is his name, with a different address listed than what's on my invoice! Ah well, let's get a timeline going and see if this different address leads us anywhere. \n\n*Early March 2018:* Here, a judgment was applied against him in early 2018 for over $50,000. https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=oR6bDSY0Nvg4h60svkrXPw== (clearly they had a better attorney than whomever I called today!) \n\n*Mid March 2018:* Here, you can see he files for bankruptcy. https://pdfhost.io/v/5jAfJy+o_initial_filingpdf.pdf\n\n*July 8th, 2018:* His bankruptcy request gets denied by court. https://imgur.com/a/zLvSuOs  \n\n*July 7th, 2018:* The registered business address goes on fire https://www.silive.com/news/2018/07/major_fdny_response_to_house_f.html\n\nWithin 24 hours, your bankruptcy filing fails and the house you registered in your filing as your business address goes on fire? \n\n\nAnd the address you include on the top of your invoices is a DIFFERENT address than the one you utilize for any work?\n\nFor more information on how this job was done, watch the rest of the series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkVbIsAWN2lucdpXqcM4qW6ev60OSXdw4 Day 11, Day 17, and the video where he swapped out plywood for OSB are the three best.\n\nTO BE CLEAR - GOTHAM CITY SOLUTIONS IS THIS MAN EUGENE HARRINGTON'S COMPANY THAT WAS HIRED TO DO THE WORK.\nGOTHAM CITY BUILDERS IS *NOT* THE SAME BUSINESS\nGOTHAM CITY TECHNOLOGY IS *NOT* THE SAME BUSINESS.\nThey just so happen to be unlucky enough to have similar names in similar areas.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50ByeqNgYjQ", "date_published": "2020-01-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w", "title": "Day 11 - Steve & Paul call out contractor", "description": "https://tinyurl.com/rossmatrix\nLet's get Right to Repair passed! https://gofund.me/1cba2545\n\ud83d\udd35 Watch the rest of this series here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkVbIsAWN2 lucdpXqcM4qW6ev60OSXdw4 \n\ud83d\udd35 To view the contract, https://imgur.com/a/fSjfmVf\n\nTO BE CLEAR - GOTHAM CITY SOLUTIONS IS THIS MAN EUGENE HARRINGTON'S COMPANY THAT WAS HIRED TO DO THE WORK.\nGOTHAM CITY BUILDERS IS *NOT* THE SAME BUSINESS\nGOTHAM CITY TECHNOLOGY IS *NOT* THE SAME BUSINESS.\nThey just so happen to be unlucky enough to have similar names in similar areas.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XaRSUKmuaa0", "date_published": "2020-01-07 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCl2mFZoRqjw_ELax4Yisf6w", "title": "Day 37 - the straw that broke the OSB's back.", "description": "https://tinyurl.com/rossmatrix\nLet's get Right to Repair passed! https://gofund.me/1cba2545\nThe video includes us speaking on a public sidewalk where there is no expectation of privacy, outside of my store.
