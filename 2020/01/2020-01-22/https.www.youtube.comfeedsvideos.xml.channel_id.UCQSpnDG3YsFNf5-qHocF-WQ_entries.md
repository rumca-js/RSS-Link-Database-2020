With so many people deciding to hold onto Windows 7 instead of upgrading to Windows 10, despite 7 reaching it's end of life, I thought it would be good to discuss what I believe are the biggest reasons some people absolutely refuse to upgrade to Windows 10. These reasons include privacy concerns, bad forced updates, and bloatware. I also go over why I think a lot of these concerns are not as big of a deal as people think, and can actually be fixed with not too much trouble.
