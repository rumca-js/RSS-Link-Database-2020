<p>Look to Michelle Obama in ceremonial lemon and Nancy Pelosi in superhero red - for winter style, start with practicalities but don’t end with them</p><p>I am writing this from the haute couture shows in Paris. Which is a dream of a trip - please don’t think I’m complaining - but it does pose one major challenge. There is nothing like walking into a Christian Dior or Chanel show, but feeling like Leonardo DiCaprio in The Revenant accidentally walking on to the set of a Grace Kelly movie, to make you appreciate how hard it is to look good in bad weather. Here at haute couture the style bar is high, however low the mercury. (I have never understood why Paris weather has such a superior reputation to London weather. My years of research, rigorously peer-reviewed – by which I mean, I asked colleagues sitting on either side of me and they <em>both</em> agreed – has led me to the conclusion that Paris gets as much wind and rain, and as many bleak days of stainless-steel skies as Britain.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/22/fashion-forecast-look-good-bad-weather-michelle-obama-lemon-nancy-pelosi-red-coat">Continue reading...</a>

But now she’s getting out, and she couldn’t be happier.</p><p>“I think I had my first interview when I was eight or nine years old, it’s pretty crazy,” Wozniacki said in an interview at the Australian Open. “My whole life, I’ve been scrutinized, my career’s been scrutinized.

<p>A crop of hyper-imaginative producers like Lighght, ELLLL and those on the Flood label all emanate from Ireland’s ‘rebel city’ – but can it hold on to them?</p><p>“Messy in the best possible way,” says <a href="https://soundcloud.com/doubt_tx">Cork producer Doubt</a> of the epiphanic experience he had in 2015 at a warehouse rave in Manor House, north London. “It was really relaxed vibes. Security – although I didn’t see many – were sound, and there were heavy bangers all night. I’d never really experienced anything like that in Ireland.”</p><p>He was in London because of English producer NKC, one of the originators of the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/nkc">club sound known as hard drum</a>, then just a Soundcloud tag. Doubt (real name Ollie McMorrow) and compatriots Tension (Dylan O’Mahony) and Syn (Reneé Griffin) set up their own label, Flood, a year after their hard drum rendezvous in London. After learning, experimenting and dawdling with friends in Cork, all it took was NKC’s raucous parties to dissolve their collective inhibition.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/22/electronic-music-cork-techno-lighght-ellll-flood-ireland-city">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rugby seems to have firm belief in its own probity but has been reminded that, like most elite sport, it is a morality free zone</p><p>At last, some good news out of the Saracens financial doping scandal, as former England wing Ugo Monye declares rugby union has lost “the moral high ground”. This is an immediate positive in a story not exactly littered with them. That said, we must sound a note of caution, as the phrase “the loss of the moral high ground” implies that one of the other sports has won it. Unless, of course, the moral high ground is lying fallow for a year, which would surely be the best option. Or rather, the second best option, after lying fallow forever.</p><p>Modern sport is about as suited to dispensing morality as Michael Jackson ever was. Which, I concede, didn’t ever stop him. But a useful rule of thumb in the sporting money trench is: the bigger the fairytale, the bigger the fakery it’s trying to hide.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/22/saracens-scandal-rugby-union-moral-high-ground">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The academy’s chief executive alleges sexual harassment, voting corruption and rape coverup within the organisation</p><p>Deborah Dugan, the chief executive and president of the Recording Academy, which organises the Grammy awards, who was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/17/grammys-chief-deborah-dugan-suspended-misconduct-allegation">suspended last week after a misconduct allegation</a>, has countered with her own 44-page legal complaint five days before 2020’s awards ceremony. In it, she alleges sexual harassment and voting corruption in the company. Her most serious claim is the academy was aware of allegations that her predecessor <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jan/30/pink-sheryl-crow-slam-grammys-neil-portnow-women-step-up">Neil Portnow</a>, who was chief executive from 2002 to 2019, raped an unnamed female recording artist.</p><p>The filing written by her legal team reads that after she was hired, “Ms Dugan was hauled into a conference room and told – for the very first time – that a foreign recording artist (and member of the academy) had accused Mr Portnow of raping her following a performance that she gave at Carnegie Hall. The news was presented to Ms Dugan as though the board had just learned of the allegation. In reality, they were well aware of the allegation at the time Ms Dugan agreed to take on the CEO position, but never told her.” The allegation of assault was, she was told, “the real reason his contract was not renewed” in 2019. She claims she was nonetheless pressured by the then chairman John Poppo to rehire Portnow as a consultant with a $750,000 salary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/22/suspended-grammys-chief-deborah-dugan-alleges-sexual-misconduct-in-recording-academy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The anti-war film – which is regarded as one of the greatest comedies of all time – has a problem with women</p><p>M*A*S*H is a rare example of a movie that has been eclipsed by its television adaptation. The 1983 finale of the long-running sitcom about a medical unit near the front lines of the Korean war was the highest-rated single television episode in history, with 125m viewers tuning in. It’s understandable that Robert Altman’s 1970 film, which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month, lives in its shadow. The subversive anti-war comedy avoided sentimentality and teachable moments in favor of cruel pranks and a more hardened cynicism. Coming at the start of cinema’s most famous decade, it is a seminal film of New Hollywood, and it bears all the hallmarks of its era: a strong anti-establishment sentiment, the foregrounding of morally ambiguous protagonists, and, unfortunately, a deep and unexamined misogyny.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2018/apr/03/my-favourite-film-decade-1970s-dont-look-now-the-godfather-jaws">From Don't Look Now to The Godfather – why the 1970s is my favourite film decade</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/21/mash-movie-robert-altman-misogyny">Continue reading...</a>

## 'People can't learn about treatments they need': why open access to medical research matters

<p>Campaigners have argued for open access to scientific research since the dawn of the internet – so why is it taking so long?</p><p>In December 2002, a Belfast teenager made world headlines after his father, Don Simms, won him the legal right to access an experimental drug. Jonathan Simms had been diagnosed with variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), a cruel and fatal neurodegenerative condition that gives sufferers an average of one year to live.</p><p>After receiving the drug pentosan polysulfate, Jonathan lived for another 10 years, defying all medical expectations. The court ruling made medical history: until that point the drug had only ever been tested on animals, and the legal decision opened doors to treatment for other patients.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jan/22/people-cant-learn-about-treatments-they-need-why-open-access-to-medical-research-matters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Landmark Trust has refurbished this historic ‘pleasure dairy’ in the Kent countryside as an ideal wifi-free getaway – some might say it’s maid in heaven</p><p>Let’s face it, at some point we’ve all had a hankering to get in touch with our inner Marie Antoinette. Not so much the thoughtless “Let them eat brioche” side of the spendthrift French queen (assuming she ever said it) but her playing at being a rustic farmworker but dropping it all and heading back to the palace as soon as it becomes a chore vibe. It’s a dream few of us get to realise, though one woman who did was Elizabeth Brownlow, 4th Countess of Darnley. She lived at a time (late 18th/early 19th century) when a return to the simple life was en vogue among the landed gentry – as a response to the mechanisation unleashed by the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Around two centuries later, I found myself staying in the restored “pleasure dairy” she had built on the southern edge of the grounds of Cobham Hall, an Elizabethan country house (now a school) near Rochester, Kent. The work of prolific architect James Wyatt, it was intended to resemble an Italianate chapel. The dairy served as an elegant retreat where Elizabeth could oversee the production of butter, cream and cheese from the estate’s cows, or hold decorous tea parties for her high-born female friends, away from the strictures of a world dominated by men.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jan/22/kent-cobham-dairy-digital-detox-landmark-trust-no-wifi">Continue reading...</a>
