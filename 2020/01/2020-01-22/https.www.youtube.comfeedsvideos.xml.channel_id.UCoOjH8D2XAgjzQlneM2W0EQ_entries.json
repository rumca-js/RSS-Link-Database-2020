So that means at some point in the process, these products and services have to exchange hands with every day citizens like you and I.\n\nAnd the way the government lets citizens and companies provide these products and services is through US government contracts.\n\nThe US spent nearly $5 trillion dollars on the war. All that money had to go to somebody.\n\nYou have the giant companies that secure the big defense contracts like Boeing, Lockheed, Halliburton. But when the US needs small orders, these big businesses can't fullfill them\n\nWhy waste your time for a few thousand to a few million in profit when you can build entire military bases for billions of dollars?\n\nAnd for two young entrepreneurs David and Efraim, that is what they took advantage of.\n\nWhen there are gov contracts that the big boys deem too small and not worth their time, we pick up their scraps, offer a competitive bid, fulfill the contract at all costs, and make a profit. \n\nAnd within their first year of business, they landed over 100 US contracts which totaled up to over $10 million dollars. Then they landed a giant $298 million dollar contract.\n\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
