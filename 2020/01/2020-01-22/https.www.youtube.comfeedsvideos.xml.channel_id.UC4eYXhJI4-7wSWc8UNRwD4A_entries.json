Cole about me doing this,' Wale said as we rode the elevator up to the Tiny Desk. \"He told me to just do my thing, but I wish I had more time to work this set out.\" Wale's friend and fellow MC was just one of several people who offered advice on how to approach his appearance for the Tiny Desk Fest. But I reminded him he's performed with a live band as much as any other rapper we've hosted, which seemed to put his mind at ease. Wale arrived eight hours before his scheduled set time and, after just minutes of rehearsal, quickly settled in and shook off any pre-show jitters.\n\nMore than 10 years ago, the man born Olubowale Victor Akintimehin generated a lot of buzz in the D.C. area with a host of mixtapes showcasing his MC skills over popular instrumentals. What separated him from the hundreds of other hopeful rappers trying to make names for themselves online was his ability to fuse go-go music \u2014 D.C.'s homegrown spin on funk \u2014 with hip-hop. (Well, that and a crazy mixtape tribute to Seinfeld.) In 2011, Wale joined forces with Rick Ross and his Maybach Music Group and had a real breakout with \"Lotus Flower Bomb,\" the lead single from his sophomore album, Ambition. It went on to earn him a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Song in 2013.\n\nA native of the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area (or DMV), Wale's calling card remains the rap ballad, a streak he continued on his 2019 album, Wow... That's Crazy, which debuted at No. 7 on Billboard's Top 200. It reveals a man more self-aware than ever, exposing flaws and struggles while keeping his self confidence fully intact.\n\nWale's Tiny Desk concert opens with his very first hit record and ends with his latest. Sandwiched between are highlights from his catalogue with a special nod to his hometown sound, courtesy of his touring band, Tre And The Ppl (formerly UCB). Tre is Wale's right hand on stage and their effortless chemistry has been intact since the beginning.\n\nThroughout 2019, Wale was pretty vocal on social media about the Tiny Desk. In September, he tweeted, \"Still never done tiny desk.. and it's like 20 min away...\". About a month later, on the same night Ward 5 Council member Kenyan McDuffie told the D.C. City Council go-go should be the official music of the district \u2014 and the night the Washington Nationals won the World Series \u2014 Wale finally made it.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Lotus Flower Bomb\"\n\"LoveHate Thing\"\n\"CC White\"\n\"Sexy Lady\"\n\"Sue Me\"\n\"On Chill\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nWale: vocals; Tre: vocals; Jerry Venable: percussion; Eric Curry: drums; Glenn Cobb: keys; Daniel Bennet: bass; Stanley Thompson: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Abby O'Neill, Bobby Carter, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts; Videographers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern, Niki Walker, CJ Riculan, Jack Corbett; Production assistant: Tsering Bista; Executive producer: Lauren Onkey; VP, programming: Anya Grundmann; Photo: Eric Lee/NPR", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyb_yLGrHE", "date_published": "2020-01-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Joyce DiDonato: NPR Music Tiny Desk Concert", "description": "Watch Joyce DiDonato play at the Tiny Desk.\n\nMore from NPR Music: \nTiny Desk Concerts: https://www.npr.org/tinydesk\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/nprmusic\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/nprmusic\n\nJan. 15, 2020 | Tom Huizenga -- When opera star Joyce DiDonato told us she wanted to sing centuries-old Italian love songs at the Tiny Desk we weren't surprised. But when she said she was bringing a jazz band to back her up, we did a double take. But that's Joyce, always taking risks. After all, the last time we filmed the down-to-earth diva, she insisted on singing an opera aria at the Stonewall Inn, the iconic gay tavern in Greenwich Village.\n\nOn paper, the idea of jazzing up old classical songs seems iffy. At the least it could come across as mannered and at worst, an anachronistic muddle. But DiDonato somehow makes it all sound indispensable, with her blend of rigor, wit and a sense of spontaneity.\n\nThe musical formula for these unorthodox arrangements makes room for typical jazz solos while DiDonato molds her phrases to the flexible rhythms and inserts old-school trills and flamboyant roulades.\n\nMuch of the credit goes to her crack band, especially trumpeter Charlie Porter with whom DiDonato trades riffs and raspy growls. Veteran bassist Chuck Israels, who keeps the music swinging hard, has played with everyone from Billie Holiday to the Kronos Quartet, and drummer Jason Haaheim's day job is principal timpanist of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Pianist Craig Terry, co-mastermind of the project, directs the young artist program at the Chicago Lyric Opera.\n\nBut the star of the show is the continually amazing DiDonato, whose voice is certainly one of the great wonders of her generation. The flexibility of the instrument, the colors she conjures and her fine-tuned dynamic range are a few of the reasons she's still at the peak of her powers. She looks and sounds like she's having the time of her life.\n\n\"It's such a rush to be here,\" DiDonato said to the appreciative audience of NPR staffers. Believe me, Joyce, the rush was all ours.\n\nSET LIST\nParisotti - Rosa: \"Se tu m'ami / Star vicino\"\nTorelli (attrib.): \"Tu lo sai\"\nConti: \"Quella fiamma\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nJoyce DiDonato: mezzo-soprano; Craig Terry: piano; Charlie Porter: trumpet; Chuck Israels: bass; Jason Haaheim: drums; Antoine Plante: bandoneon\n\nCREDITS\nProducers: Tom Huizenga, Maia Stern, Morgan Noelle Smith; Creative director: Bob Boilen; Audio engineers: Josh Rogosin, James Willetts, J.
