F-Droid gives you the opportunity to take your phone completely Google-free, because you can find a free and privacy-respecting alternative for pretty much any mainstream app on Play Store that doesn\u2019t sell your data to Facebook or Google. If you are running LineageOS or some other custom ROM, you can avoid Google privacy invasion through Play Store by using F-Droid instead. \n\nSources\nF-Droid https://f-droid.org/\nHow to install APK files from unknown sources on Android https://www.maketecheasier.com/install-apps-from-unknown-sources-android/ \nAPK verifying tool https://apkpure.com/apk-signature-verification \nNetGuard https://f-droid.org/en/packages/eu.faircode.netguard/\nWebApps https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.tobykurien.webapps/\nBromite for F-Droid https://www.bromite.org/fdroid\nDuckDuckGo Privacy Browser https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.duckduckgo.mobile.android/\nFirefox Focus (Klar) https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.mozilla.klar/\nNew Pipe https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.schabi.newpipe/\nSimple Apps - all can be found on F-Droid https://www.simplemobiletools.com/\n\nCredits:\nMusic by CO.AG Music https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA\n\nFollow me:\nhttps://twitter.com/The_HatedOne_\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/TheHatedOne/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/thehatedone/\nhttps://www.minds.com/The_HatedOne\n\nThe footage and images featured in the video were for critical analysis, commentary and parody, which are protected under the Fair Use laws of the United States Copyright act of 1976.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FfWz1NRQJQ", "date_published": "2020-01-22 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
