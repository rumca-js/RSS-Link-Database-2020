It's been a long development cycle, but now with Kentucky Route Zero TV Edition, you can play through the entire journey from start to finish.\n\nIn the video above, Ben Janca, Jean-Luc Seipke, and Kurt Indovina discuss the entire experience of Kentucky Route Zero from 2013's Act I to 2020's Act V (don't worry, no spoilers) and explain why you should spend the money and time to play through the game's five chapters if you haven't already. Act V might be the only new chapter in Kentucky Route Zero, but the entire game holds up today--offering a point-and-click adventure where every choice, even the more subtle ones, can carry an impact.\n\nKentucky Route Zero TV Edition is available for Xbox One, PS4, Switch, and PC.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i18WHcceTVw", "date_published": "2020-01-28 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Journey To The Savage Planet Is 2020's First Great Co-Op Game", "description": "Rob Handlery and Jake Dekker explore the wacky world of Journey To The Savage Planet in this video.
