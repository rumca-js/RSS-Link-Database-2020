## The Windermere Children review – how the Lakes saved the lives of Nazi survivors

<p>This little-told story of the young people rescued from concentration camps and sent to Britain is poignant, hopeful – and should shame our government to the core</p><p>The most powerful moments of The Windermere Children (BBC Two) come in the final few minutes when the drama stops and the teenage Polish actors playing Holocaust survivors brought to Britain after the war are suddenly replaced by the survivors themselves – real people, still alive, talking about their happy and fulfilled lives. It seems more than just a familiar device to show that the film is based on actual people and true events. This has been a story about survival and recovery from unimaginable trauma, so seeing these men smiling, thriving, provides an unexpectedly optimistic conclusion.</p><p>In 1945, the British government agreed to accept about 750 children rescued from Auschwitz and Belsen; 300 of them were brought to Windermere for a period of rehabilitation before being found permanent homes. The children file off the bus in silence, and are told to queue up for a medical examination – boys to the left, girls to the right – before being made to strip off their clothes. “Relax,” one boy tells another reassuringly. “Relax gets you killed,” comes the reply. When one is asked his name, he automatically rolls up a sleeve to show the camp number tattooed on his arm. They are taken to sleep in factory workers’ barracks, which from the outside look disturbingly like concentration camp sheds. They find it hard to believe that this is not going to end badly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/27/the-windermere-children-review-how-the-lakes-saved-the-lives-of-nazi-survivors">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Beasts of the Southern Wild director Benh Zeitlin returns with an overlong and sometimes excruciating update of the Pan story </p><p>Wendy, a spin on JM Barrie’s Peter Pan myth, takes all the chaos, noise and lack-of-focus of director Benh Zeitlin’s earlier picture <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/18/beast-southern-wild-review">Beasts of the Southern Wild</a> and amplifies it. The 2012 surprise hit, which went from Sundance discovery to four Academy Award nominations, got a tremendous amount of mileage from its peculiarity of place and heartfelt father-daughter relationship. That’s very much missing here. What we’re left with is something like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/nov/27/where-the-wild-things-are">Spike Jonze’s 2009 adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are</a> without the adorable creatures. Wendy is undoubtedly self-assured and in-your-face, and the gorgeous location photography certainly has an impact. But it’s wrecked by chapters so lengthy they become simply excruciating.</p><p>We begin with a tense scene in a greasy spoon diner loaded with crusty characters inches from a train yard hauling freight. After a child totters off and disappears, we cut years later to three pre-adolescent siblings (friends of the missing kid), children of the restaurant’s hardworking but loving single mom owner. From the window of her bedroom, Wendy (Devin French) spies a kid on the roof of a passing train and takes a leap of faith. Her twin brothers (Gage and Gavin Naquin) follow. In time (and via many methods of transport) they arrive in a mystical land where unaccompanied minors are free to stomp around, yell and never grow up.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/wendy-review-peter-pan-fantasy-that-never-grows-up-into-an-interesting-film">Continue reading...</a>

Feted as honoured guests in the place where once they were reviled inmates, even together they filled just a few rows. They were at the front of a vast marquee, large enough to house the iconic “gate of death” through which those men and women – almost all mere boys and girls at the time – had passed when it was not theatrically lit to make a spectacular backdrop for television, but when it had the power to terrify.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/27/thou-shalt-not-be-indifferent-from-auschwitzs-gate-of-hell-a-last-desperate-warning">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Degrees in this emerging field offer fascinating research opportunities and career options</p><p>If your pets could speak, what would they tell you? Experts at the animal-computer interaction lab at the Open University (OU) are close to finding out. There, animal behaviour specialists work with designers to create the kind of technology that helps animals communicate and work alongside humans more naturally – to raise the alarm if an owner falls ill, put a wash on, or switch out the lights for an owner who has a disability.</p><p>“If you give animals more of a voice, they can make themselves better understood. It’s as though they can talk back to us – and this can be very valuable,” says Clara Mancini, a communication and design expert who founded the lab back in 2011. “We are researching with them, allowing animals to participate in the design process.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/27/call-of-the-wild-the-new-science-of-human-animal-communication">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Emily Stevenson, an MSc student at Exeter, co-founded Beach Guardian CIC in 2017 </p><p>I’ve been incredibly lucky to grow up in Cornwall so I feel a strong duty of care towards the ocean. As a child, I started making art out of the plastic I found on beaches and set up my first website when I was 11 to raise awareness and funds for the Marine Conservation Society. While studying marine biology at Plymouth University as an undergraduate, I realised how dire the situation really was and how much needs to be done.</p><p>In 2017, during my third year, I co-founded a social enterprise called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BeachGuardian/" title="">Beach Guardian CIC</a> with my dad. After watching Blue Planet, people wanted to make a change but didn’t know how, so we had the privilege of facilitating local community beach cleans around Padstow – it’s a special thing because everyone feels Beach Guardian belongs to all of us. We’d be nothing without the volunteers who join us on the beach.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jan/27/volunteering-is-one-of-the-most-important-things-you-can-do-how-one-student-is-tackling-the-environmental-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

On Monday the inquiry’s second phase opened with the revelation that Arconic, the cladding system’s manufacturer, knew five years before Grenfell’s refurbishment that its panels were “not suitable for use on building facades” in Europe because they did not meet safety standards.</p><p>When much of the argument about the disaster’s causes is unavoidably technical, involving as it does details of construction contracts and building regulation, such straightforward language has an immediate impact.

The inquiry also heard that Celotex, the company which made the insulation used on Grenfell, was concerned in 2013 about how the material would behave in a fire when used behind cladding.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/the-guardian-view-on-the-grenfell-inquiry-trust-must-be-rebuilt">Continue reading...</a>

The 18-year-old whispery pop innovator swept all of the “big four” categories – album of the year, record of the year, song of the year and best new artist – with her debut album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?. She became only the second person in history to do so – and the first woman and youngest person (the first person to win all four of these awards in one go was Christopher Cross, in 1981). She also broke a record previously held by Taylor Swift. A decade ago, Swift became the youngest person to win album of the year, aged 20. Eilish unseated her, with an offering that would never have seemed likely to seduce the mainstream.

<p>The BBC reporter has revealed that his work has left him with PTSD. On Holocaust Memorial Day, we should remember the debt we owe to those who have experienced dreadful things on our behalf</p><p>Trauma, like its sibling stress, is a much-overused word these days. People are “stressed” by a full inbox or “traumatised” because they left their phone in an Uber. Maybe we underplay the reality of trauma because we cannot look it in the face. Our streets are full of bundles of rags in sleeping bags, with people inside. We could ask them about the trauma of abuse or addiction, but we scuttle past. This is not a blame game – we all cope by shutting down.</p><p>But what if you can’t shut down? What if you can’t forget? What if the horrors you have seen can’t be put in a box marked “the past”, but are ever-present? Then you are in trouble. It was tremendously brave, even for a brave man such as the BBC reporter Fergal Keane, to talk about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Keane had been dealing with this after decades of reporting from conflict zones all over the world. His colleague Jeremy Bowen has spoken of long period of depression and PTSD after his many years in the Middle East.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/we-should-thank-fergal-keane-for-bearing-witness-to-unbearable-horrors">Continue reading...</a>

## The Nest review – Jude Law and Carrie Coon fall apart in eerie 80s drama

<p>The director of Martha Marcy May Marlene has delivered an accomplished follow-up focused on a family imploding in a gloomy house in Surrey</p><p>There’s always a warm homecoming at festivals for directors who return after breaking out there years prior, as well as an unspoken fear that their follow-up might not have quite the same impact. In 2011, Sean Durkin premiered his first feature, the chilly psychodrama Martha Marcy May Marlene, at Sundance and won a directing award as well as a flurry of excitable reviews, planting his name, as well as star Elizabeth Olsen’s, on the map. It was the kind of jolting debut that made anyone who watched it curious to know what he would do next. In the nine years since, he directed the disturbing British miniseries Southcliffe, but has been notably absent from the big screen. He returns to the fold this year with the accomplished and uneasy family drama The Nest, a film with a delicate slow build that feels fitting for a director who’s also taken his time to make it.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/downhill-review-ferrell-and-louis-dreyfus-crash-with-redundant-remake">Downhill review – Ferrell and Louis-Dreyfus crash with redundant remake</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/27/the-nest-review-jude-law-carrie-coon">Continue reading...</a>

## Get another room! Should you have a dedicated sex den in your home?

<p>Could a love nest other than the bedroom spice up your relationship – or is a sex drawer all you need? Here’s what the experts say</p><p>As if the housing crisis were not acute enough, it turns out that your home probably does not have the one room that promises a life of excitement and a long-lasting, fulfilling relationship: a shag room. A dedicated space for such purposes is the “hot new trend for sex in 2020”, according to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/fabulous/10825014/couples-never-have-sex-bedroom/" title="">Sun</a>. The actor Brian Cox recently told the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/13/successions-brian-cox-i-was-touched-up-by-princess-margaret" title="">Guardian</a> that he and his wife meet up in a room a few floors below their Manhattan apartment. “It’s basically her room and I’m allowed to visit occasionally,” he said. So if you don’t have a dedicated shag space, are you missing out? Should you turf one of the kids out of their room, or forgo a downstairs loo?</p><p>For most of us, the bedroom is where the action happens, but as Lucy Beresford, the broadcaster and author of Happy Relationships, says, it “also becomes the place where you charge your mobile phone, have your laundry basket, maybe your kids come in and want to share your bed at various times of the night. All of those things need to be stripped out if possible. If that is difficult, having a room that is completely dedicated [to sex] is a brilliant idea.” Furnish it how you like, install flattering lighting. “You can pretend you’re in a hotel, you can turn it into whatever you want it to be. It’s also a place you go to, so it has that sense of anticipation – every time you go to the den, this is what’s going to happen – and that can be just as arousing. It can also be the place that everybody else knows is your sex space.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2020/jan/27/get-another-room-should-you-have-a-dedicated-sex-den-in-your-home">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The children’s animation about problem-solving dogs started with a simple premise but it was ruined by commerce and a conveyor belt of plastic tat</p><p>Thanks to YouTube, children’s entertainment has become the wild west. Traditional kids’ shows now have to compete with badly animated nursery rhymes, toy unboxers and – in one unfortunate incident I stumbled across three weeks ago – a Lego remake of Avengers: Endgame where Captain America gets stabbed through the heart by a home invader. Compared to this, even the most cynical, conventionally made kids’ show is a relief. Even Paw Patrol – a dystopian fantasy about every terrible thing that would happen if a society chose to privatise its emergency services and sell them to a suspiciously wealthy 10-year-old with a worrying penchant for strapping heavy robotic equipment to puppies – was a source of relief, at first.</p><p>Sure, there were gripes. The male dogs heavily outnumbered the females. Chase, the matinee idol of the Paw Patrol, constantly elbowed his way to the front of every episode at the expense of poor, overlooked Zuma. The mayor was just a negligent woman who walked around with a chicken in her handbag. But the show on the whole had a sensible underlying schema. There would be a problem. The dogs would be told how to fix it. They would fix it. The end.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/27/jump-the-shark-paw-patrol">Continue reading...</a>

They live in Montreal, Canada</p><p>Joanne and Julien met at the scene of a bank robbery, just after the police had shot and killed the culprit. It was 1988, and “there were a lot of bank robberies that year,” Joanne says. Montreal, continues Julien, “used to have the reputation of being the bank robbery capital of the world”. He was the political reporter for the Montreal Daily News. It was a boring beat compared with the action happening on the streets, he says, so he and a colleague, the photographer Aussie Whiting, would listen out for police reports of robberies and rush off to them. “We were always the first on the scene,” he says. On that summer’s day: “We got in his car and he zoomed through all the red lights.” They got exclusive photographs and interviews with the police.</p><p>By the time Joanne, a radio reporter for Canada’s national broadcaster, CBC, arrived, everyone had gone, although there was still some blood on the pavement. “It was pretty grisly in those days,” she says. “No one else was around and then I saw Julien sitting on a bench.” They got talking and he offered to give her his recorded interviews. “I saved her story,” he says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/27/how-we-met-police-shot-bank-robber-julien-joanne">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Nazi death camp was liberated 75 years ago, but across the world its malign influence lives on</p><p>My uncle Max survived several years in Auschwitz. I was not close to my uncle. When we visited my first cousins in their house on Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn, he was often in the basement – as a tailor, a trade he learned in a camp for displaced persons, he liked to work long hours. Once, catching me for some unfathomable reason singing Deutschland, Deutschland über alles at age nine or so, he told me about a day in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/auschwitz-gates-hell-75-years-on" title="">Auschwitz</a>. From that point on, I was frightened that he would tell me more, and avoided him.</p><p>Max died of a heart attack in his late 50s. Except for his relationship with my cousins, with whom I was then so close, he did not play much of a role in my life. But Auschwitz did.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/27/holocaust-auschwitz-far-right-nazis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ultrarunner Zoe Pye fell in love with snowboarding 10 years ago despite suffering from vertigo. Never one to shy away from a challenge, she’s run some of the world’s toughest ultramarathons and reveals why active holidays are the perfect antidote to the stress of everyday life</p><p>When Zoe Pye says: “I like to have goals that excite me”, she doesn’t just mean resolving to walk an extra stop for the bus or take the stairs rather than the lift. From running ultramarathons through deserts and across the polar ice cap, to learning to snowboard and samba in her 30s, Pye strives to always be in the process of learning at least one new skill.</p><p>Impressively, Pye’s appetite for adventure extends to her high-flying financial career in London, yet she’s the antithesis of a high achiever on the hunt for trophies; humbly regarding her extreme physical pursuits as an antidote to the pace and stress of city life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/ready-set-ski/2020/jan/27/i-feel-invincible-after-a-trip-to-the-mountains-why-the-slopes-provide-the-ultimate-relaxation">Continue reading...</a>

## The truth about hydration: should you drink eight glasses of water a day?

<p>The 8x8 rule has become a health goal for many. But when it comes to healthy skin, eyes and having bags of energy, the research tells another story<br /></p><p>Before you read this article, can I just check you’ve drunk enough water today? You might want to refill your bottle because, remember, if you wait until you feel thirsty, you may already be dehydrated. No one is sure where this advice came from, but it’s all over the internet.</p><p>“Nowadays this is not considered sensible,” says Stuart Galloway, an associate professor in physiology, exercise and nutrition at the University of Stirling. “As humans, we have this homeostatic system, so when we need water, we feel thirsty.” Drinking when you are thirsty, he says, maintains your body’s water level within about 1-2% of its ideal state. “For most people, this is absolutely fine. Even for athletes, a loss of around 1% is considered to have negligible impact upon performance. So, although thirst may not kick in until you have lost some body water, this is not necessarily a bad thing.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/27/the-truth-about-hydration-should-you-drink-eight-glasses-of-water-a-day">Continue reading...</a>

The fly-half Katy Daley-Mclean scored the most points and the wing Jessica Breach the most tries (there was no female player of the tournament; that accolade will be introduced for the first time this year).</p><p>Since then England have enjoyed a dominant autumn and can also boast they have the world’s best player in their ranks: Emily Scarratt, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/03/england-emily-scarratt-womens-world-player-of-the-year" title="">who received that accolade in November</a>.
