I have wanted to take on a cooking video for a while, so here is: Cooking With Gordon Ramsay Is An Absolute Nightmare, and This Is Why. This is a little less of a “how to” cooking video as opposed to a sketch show with Gordon Ramsay and cooking mixed in occasionally.

I threatened that I would do this when I did “the joy of painting” is an absolute nightmare and here it is! Gordon Ramsay is a little more excitable, although his recipes are pretty amazing.

I actually filmed this as a Christmas video, thus the Christmassy beef wellington, but this cooking video is hardly a “how to” so I don’t think it would lead you successfully recreating a Gordon Ramsay dish. It’s also not very Christmassy, given how much I dress up as Gordon Ramsay and swear. 

I enjoy cooking so thought I would be more successful cooking a Gordon Ramsay dish, than painting a Bob Ross painting, but including all the jokes, and cooking the wellington, turned out to be an absolute nightmare, and this is why!

I have another “cooking with Gordon Ramsay is an absolute nightmare” video coming out in a few weeks, where we will be making a souffle. I also will be working on a Boneworks VR review, and a remastered version of my Skyrim VR video. So lots coming!
