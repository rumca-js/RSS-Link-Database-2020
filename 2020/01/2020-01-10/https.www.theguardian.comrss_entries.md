## Has Instagram changed after its ban on self-harm images?

<p>A year on from banning self-harm images, we’d like to hear your thoughts on how the photo-sharing platform has improved the situation for people</p><p>Last year Instagram announced that it would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/28/instagram-extend-ban-images-self-harm-cartoons">ban all graphic self-harm images</a> as part of a series of changes made in response to the death of the British teenager Molly Russell.<br /><br />The photo-sharing platform made the decision after being met with a tide of public anger over the suicide of a 14-year-old girl, whose Instagram account contained distressing material about depression and suicide.<br /><br />A year on, we want to hear your views on how the platform has improved the situation for people. Are images of self-harm still visible via private accounts? Are certain hashtags used to unearth such images? Has the ban helped? What other areas need to be addressed? How do you feel about the support that is offered via the platform?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/10/has-instagram-changed-after-its-ban-on-self-harm-images">Continue reading...</a>

## 'I want to return the faith everyone has shown in me': overcoming the hurdles of homelessness

<p>UK charities carry out vital work highlighting the plight of people who are homeless and helping them tackle everyday obstacles. Here, three of those who’ve had a new start with charity support share their stories</p><p>At this time of the year, thoughts increasingly turn to those who are sleeping rough. Freezing temperatures and darker evenings make people who are homeless even more vulnerable than usual. Meanwhile, the recent festive holidays have filled our TV screens with idyllic images of domestic warmth – drawing an even sharper contrast between rough sleepers and those of us lucky enough to have a roof over our heads. We hear their stories thanks to the tireless work done by homeless charities to help them and highlight their plight. Many of the hurdles they face during their day-to-day lives are things the rest us take for granted.</p><p><strong>Iulian, 33<br /></strong>I was living in a shared flat in Hounslow, working as a construction labourer, but I didn’t get paid for the work I did and I ended up on the streets. I headed into central London to try to find shelter and work. At night, I looked for somewhere safe to sleep – passages that were well-lit or places that had CCTV. It was a difficult time, it was winter and really harsh. I survived on charity food handouts. All I had was my mobile phone, which was my only lifeline.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/project-reconnect/2020/jan/10/i-want-to-return-the-faith-everyone-has-shown-in-me-overcoming-the-hurdles-of-homelessness">Continue reading...</a>

## 'Try a different route, you might just love it': Jamal Edwards MBE on the apprenticeships boom

<p>The SB.TV founder is passionate about showing young people that there are many ways they can reach their potential – and he believes apprenticeships are one of the best paths available</p><p>Getting my MBE for my work in music and business in 2014 was a nuts day. I received it alongside Joan Collins, who was being made a Dame, and at the end of the day, I looked at my mum, dad and sister, and was like: “Well look at that, Jamal is with Dame Joan Collins!” It was so surreal.</p><p>Looking back on when I was starting out, my parents definitely struggled with the fact that I wasn’t going to uni, instead choosing to focus on making my music video platform, SB.TV, work. I was doing a BTec in media and moving image, but I really wanted to be out filming for SB.TV – the more I did, the more fire I had to continue. In the end, I made a deal with my parents: if I completed my diploma, they’d let me concentrate on my passion. They agreed, so I put my head down and got it done. Today, SB.TV is a full-blown entertainment company, but when I said I was getting into YouTube to start it, the response was mainly: “Uh, right …” as it had only been around for a year when I signed up in 2006. Even when it started to become more successful there was still a feeling among some people that it wasn’t going to work out and that I needed to get a “proper job”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fire-up-your-future/2020/jan/10/try-a-different-route-you-might-just-love-it-jamal-edwards-mbe-on-the-apprenticeships-boom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Writers promise charity donations if press secretary agrees to ‘do her job’ and field journalists’ questions after 300-day hiatus</p><p>Bestselling novelists Stephen King and Don Winslow have offered to donate $200,000 (£153,000) to a children’s hospital if the White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, will hold a press conference.</p><p>White House press briefings used to be a regular affair, but the last one <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/01/07/stephanie-grisham-press-briefings-ridiculist-sot-pkg-ac360-vpx.cnn">was held more than 300 days ago</a>, according to CNN, by Grisham’s predecessor in the role, Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

Superlative self-care in sweetened fruit and nubbly, buttery topping, the crumble is, for all its seeming inviolability in the Bunterish pantheon of great British puds, a surprisingly new addition to the calorific canon. It may even be an American import of sorts (where it is known as apple crisp), given the earliest print recipes for the crisp-slash-crumble are both found in US cookbooks, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_crisp">1924</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/oct/14/how-to-make-perfect-crumble">1950</a>, depending on who you Google.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/10/how-to-eat-apple-crumble">Continue reading...</a>

It had been a regular Christmas date since the 1920s: a traditional family circus with a ringmaster, band, tigers, bears and performing ponies, along with acrobats, strongmen and clowns. The Guardian photographer Don McPhee was there to take this picture of a woman being “kissed” by one of the circus’s horses as part of an act. McPhee, who was based in Manchester, began his career working for local newspapers before joining the Guardian in 1970. He died in 2007.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/10/buy-a-classic-guardian-photograph-a-horse-kisses-a-woman-at-belle-vue-christmas-circus-1981">Continue reading...</a>

The God Game by Danny Tobey; The Conscientious Objector by Stephen Palmer; Fate of the Fallen by Kel Kade; The Shadow Saint by Gareth Hanrahan; and The Glass Breaks by AJ Smith<p>Danny Tobey’s second novel, <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/the-god-game-9781473224476.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article" title=""><strong>The God Game</strong> (Gollancz, £16.99)</a>, is a fast-paced satirical techno-thriller examining the fault lines of morality within a group of five Texan teenagers. Grieving the death of his mother and negotiating a fraught relationship with his father, 17-year-old Charlie finds himself drawn into a dangerously compelling online game with a controller that calls itself God. Charlie and his nerdish friends become the playthings of an artificial intelligence that sends them out on missions in the real world. Tempting them with cash and other rewards, the AI gradually inveigles the group into committing morally dubious acts, leading to betrayal and even the threat of death. Tobey brilliantly captures the immersive, claustrophobic atmosphere of the malign game and its addictive allure for a collection of flawed and needy characters. Slick, pared-down prose and short chapters propel the reader towards a disturbing climax.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/10/best-recent-science-fiction-fantasy-review-roundup">Continue reading...</a>

The book, which is divided into fragments each cleaving to a different literary genre, is an attempt, at some 10 years’ distance, to make sense of the experience of her early 20s, when she was not only trapped in a house with a woman who gave every appearance of wanting to destroy her, but trapped in a relationship trope – an abusive lesbian partnership – not widely recognised as even existing.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jan/07/carmen-maria-machado-meet-the-author-fiction-interview" title="">Machado</a> is sitting across from me in the bar of her hotel in New York, on a brief visit from her home in Philadelphia.

<p>Early interactions with caregivers can dramatically affect your beliefs about yourself, your expectations of others, and how you cope with stress and regulate your emotions as an adult</p><p>In 2006, a team of Norwegian researchers set out to study how experienced psychotherapists help people to change. Led by Michael Rønnestad, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Oslo, the team <a href="https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/aca/helgero/process%20_outcome_study%5B1%5D.pdf">followed</a> 50 therapist-patient pairs, tracking, in minute detail, what the therapists did that made them so effective. Margrethe Halvorsen, a post-doc at the time, was given the job of interviewing the patients at the end of the treatment.</p><p>That’s how she met Cora – a woman in her late 40s, single, childless, easy to like. As a kid, Cora (a pseudonym) had suffered repeated sexual abuse at the hands of her mother and her mother’s friends. Before entering therapy, she habitually self-harmed. She’d tried to kill herself a number of times, too, her body still scarred by the remnants of suicides not carried through.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/10/psychotherapy-childhood-mental-health">Continue reading...</a>

## A porn site tricked and degraded women – and that was exactly its point

<p>GirlsDoPorn defrauded unsuspecting women, a court found. But a successful $13m lawsuit won’t fix a culture of contempt</p><p>In the ads, the women were clothed. Appearing on innocuous sites like Craigslist, they advertised modeling opportunities that paid about $5,000. There was no indication that nudity or sex would be involved. One ad asked for “beautiful, college-type pretty girls” for photo and video shoots. When women responded, they were directed to websites that showed no evidence of porn. They were asked for contact information and photographs on pages that showed more pictures of clothed women. One woman flew to San Diego to pursue what she thought was the modeling opportunity. When she arrived, she found herself in a hotel room with two men, who told her she would be shooting a pornographic video.</p><p>This was the tactic used by the producers of GirlsDoPorn, according to a California superior court judge’s finding in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/03/girlsdoporn-site-pay-127m-women-didnt-know-videos-posted">a lawsuit brought by 22 women</a>: they entrapped and defrauded women into making pornography. Alone in the hotel rooms with strange men, the women were asked to sign contracts written in dense legalese, but they were discouraged from reading them. They were told that the contracts stated that the images would never be put online and never distributed in the United States; they were told that no one would find out their real identities. This was a lie. In fact, the videos were posted on the GirlsDoPorn subscription sites as well as on free sites like Pornhub.com. Their identities were easily findable; many of the women faced humiliation and ostracism in their communities. They say that when they sued the producers, the men made sure that the videos were sent to people they knew, in a retaliation tactic reminiscent of revenge porn. The legal complaint says that the men’s actions cost the women educational and professional opportunities. Some of the women became suicidal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/10/pornography-misogyny-women">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With us gone, other species will have a chance to recover</p><p>Fifty years ago, I concluded that the best thing for the planet would be a peaceful phase-out of human existence. We’re causing the extinction of hundreds of thousands of other species. With us gone, I believe ecosystems will be restored and there will be enough of everything. No more fighting over resources. The idea wasn’t as well received as I had hoped.</p><p>My journey to advocating for voluntary human extinction began at school. I was born in the post-war baby boom in a small desert town in Oregon, in the US. There were more new students than the elementary school could cope with, so classes overflowed into churches. In my fourth year, we were taught in the county library; people checked out books as we learned. High school was the same: the cafeteria had to be converted into classrooms. There just weren’t enough resources – a situation that remains the same as we boomers enter our final decades.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/10/i-campaign-for-the-extinction-of-the-human-race-les-knight">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Oklahoman was marginalised in his lifetime as much for his sexuality as his unusual designs, no two of which were the same</p><p>Bruce Goff was the ultimate outsider architect. Despite being one of the most innovative, imaginative and downright interesting architects in history, with admirers including Frank Gehry, Mies van der Rohe, Philip Johnson and Frank Lloyd Wright, Goff, who died in 1982, remains a marginal figure. His exile was partly self-imposed, but there are signs that Goff was also pushed out – as a result of his sexuality as much as his unorthodox design philosophy.</p><p>We’ve come to associate US midcentury modernism with minimalism – everything clean and straight and simple. Goff’s buildings were the exact opposite: curvaceous or unconventionally geometric, busy, flamboyant, mysterious. Critics of the era could not get a handle on him. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/15/charles-jencks-obituary" title="">Charles Jencks</a> described him as “the Michelangelo of kitsch”. Others described his work as organic, futuristic, or sci-fi. He was pop and postmodern before the terms existed. What’s more, not one of Goff’s works resembles another, making him even harder to classify.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/10/michelangelo-kitsch-outsider-architect-bruce-goff">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I love the bouncing of hailstones off sitting room windowpanes, muffled by curtains drawn against the winter dark</p><p>It’s a memory from many of our childhoods: tucked up cosily in sleeping bags, safely inside tents, the patter of heavy rain against canvas overhead.

Or, as I seem to remember vividly when a toddler, under a plastic pram cover). Or even under an umbrella. The sound of rain pelting a car window, along with the squeak of the windscreen wipers, will do it for me. The bouncing of hailstones off sitting room windowpanes, muffled slightly by curtains drawn against the winter dark. I especially love the sound of hail pinging off the inside of a chimney chute and hitting the hearth.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/10/nothing-better-than-being-at-home-when-its-raining-hannah-jane-parkinson">Continue reading...</a>

The fibres measure a mere 8-10 microns in width, making it about 10 times finer than human hair and eight times warmer than sheep wool. This luxurious fibre is known the world over as pashmina, the softest and most expensive type of cashmere wool in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/10/cashmere-country-the-perils-of-making-the-worlds-finest-fabric">Continue reading...</a>

The story of El Salvador’s gang problem is a study in shortsighted thinking – and Donald Trump’s policies threaten to make a bad situation even worse. By William Wheeler<p>Israel Ticas is racing down the highway, drumming his hands on the wheel of “The Beast”, a tall, boxy police truck that he aims at the small, bustling town of San Luis Talpa, about 25 miles south of El Salvador’s capital, San Salvador. </p><p>A decades-long veteran of the security forces, Ticas’s first job was as an artist in the counter-terrorism unit, sketching suspected guerillas during the country’s 1979–1992 civil war. The experience left him equally as distrustful of the rightwing generals he had served as of the guerrilla commanders who would join them among the political elite at war’s end. In most ways, the country has never quite recovered since. In 2015, homicides in El Salvador rivalled the most violent peak of the civil war, and it ranks consistently among the world’s most violent nations. Before long, Ticas spots a body by the roadside. “It’s fresh,” he observes. “With clothes on.” It hasn’t been stripped or dismembered. The victim, he says, was likely shot at that spot during the night.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jan/10/how-the-us-helped-create-el-salvadors-bloody-gang-war">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As I write my last column for the Guardian, my thoughts turn to the life lessons my mother taught me</p><p>As a child my mother used to put on the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubDVUQon5BE" title="">Young, Gifted and Black</a>, by Bob and Marcia, put my feet on hers and then dance us both around the living room. “They’re playing our song,” she’d say. It was the early 1970s, she was barely 30 and I was the youngest of three children she was raising alone. Struggling to believe there was a viable future for her children in a country where racism was on the rise and the economy was in the tank, she had seriously considered returning to Barbados. But after a six-week family trip back she decided we’d struggle to keep up academically: at school in England I played; in Barbados we sat in rows and recited times tables. I think this was partly cover for the fact that, after more than a decade of self-reliance and relative anonymity, fitting back into island life would have been difficult. So we danced around the living room, singing ourselves up: imagining a world in which we would thrive, for which we had no evidence, but great expectations.</p><p>In my interview for a Guardian Scott Trust bursary to study a postgraduate course in journalism, I was asked what kind of job I would aspire to if I ever got to work at the paper. “A columnist, like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hugoyoung" title="">Hugo Young</a>,” I said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/10/bleak-times-thrive-last-column-guardian">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From miniature lives to the secrets of maths, Ziya Tong shares books to widen our worldview</p><p>They say there’s a German word for everything. My favourite is <em>Lebenswelt</em>, an idea described by the Austrian philosopher Alfred Schütz as “that province of reality which the wide-awake and normal adult simply takes for granted as common sense”. Probing beyond this is the hard work of authors: they remove our blinkers, while revealing deeper layers of reality. That is, they teach us how to <em>see</em>, instead of merely look.</p><p>Take a simple patch of dirt. Most of us wouldn’t look twice. But David Haskell spent a year nose-deep in leaf litter examining a single square metre of old-growth forest in Tennessee. In <strong>The Forest Unseen</strong> he documents the marvellous profusion of life, and all the miniature commuters – from snails and salamanders to coyote pups and woodpeckers – that cross this small parcel of land, or call it their home. The result is an almost magical look at the interconnectedness of the natural world, and the invisible ties that bind us together.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/10/best-books-reveal-blind-spots-further-reading">Continue reading...</a>
