<p>Watch your humble vegetables transform into luxurious delicacies after a warm bath in oil and aromatics</p><p>Slow-cooking in fat, or confiting, to use the fancy term, is usually associated with meat (or for preserving fruit in sugar syrup). For me, however, vegetables are the biggest winners from a long, warm bath of oil and aromatics. In the process (which isn’t actually that long with veg), they tenderise and soak up a bunch of flavours that make them rich, unctuous and delicious. It’s a total transformation of something mild and humble into something rich and luxurious. All they then need is a spot of acidity or a touch of heat, and you’ve got glorious vegetables, reimagined, on the table.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/18/yotam-ottolenghi-slow-cooking-recipes-mushrooms-parsnips-and-brussels-sprouts">Continue reading...</a>

Liking the film is now considered as much a part of being a thoughtful modern woman as supporting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Because this movie isn’t just good, people wrote with urgency on social media – it’s important. It’s about women and creativity and it stars women – four of them! It’s an adaptation of one of the greatest women’s novels, done by Gerwig, who, like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was decreed by The Council of General Consensus to be An Excellent Thing.

<p>Shellac and gel won’t wreck your nails if they are good quality and removed properly – I’ve got the method down pat</p><p>Two friends tell me that one of their new year’s resolutions is taking a break from gels and ultraviolet lamp-cured, soak-off nail polishes. That’s because, despite the dramatic global increase in salon gel manicures, thanks to an instantly dry, super-shiny finish that lasts up to three weeks instead of the traditional three to five days (seriously, it’s a bleak time for regular polish brands), there’s a pervading belief that gels ultimately “wreck your nails”.</p><p>This is only a tiny bit true, in that all manicures involving repeated filing and exposure to solvents will weaken the nails in the long term: the issue is not with gels per se.

She’s three years old. She fell into a canal,” said a senior nurse. “By the time her parents managed to get her out, apparently she’d already stopped breathing.” “Paramedics three minutes away,” called another nurse, holding the scarlet phone on which emergencies were called through. With a grace and efficiency akin to choreography, a team of professionals who moments beforehand had been as disparate as atoms, dispersed across the hospital, were poised around an empty resuscitation bed, waiting as one to swing into action.</p><p>The consultant quietly confirmed each team member’s role. The anaesthetist, responsible for airway. The scribe, who would note down, in meticulous detail, the timings, the drugs, the doses, every iota of care which, if we were lucky, might snatch life back from lifelessness. Doctor one, doctor two – the roles and responsibilities went on. Then, a moment of silence before the paramedics’ brute force pushed a trolley through the swing doors and there, tiny, limp and pale, lay a toddler, unmoving beneath the harsh fluorescent lights.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/18/all-that-is-good-in-human-nature-is-here-rachel-clarke-on-life-and-death-at-her-nhs-hospice">Continue reading...</a>

## The Shadow King by Maaza Mengiste review – remembering Ethopia’s female soldiers

<p>Set during Italy’s 1935 invasion of Ethiopia, this absorbing novel spotlights the African women who went to war</p><p>The eponymous king in Maaza Mengiste’s second novel does not feature until a good halfway through the narrative, and then in appropriately shadowy fashion. He is Minim, a “soft-spoken man with the strange name that means Nothing”, one of those who has answered the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie’s call to arms provoked by the Italian invasion of the country in 1935. But Minim has an unexpectedly propitious quality; a close resemblance to Selassie, now in exile in Bath, that can be used to reinvigorate popular confidence that the European colonialists can be defeated. Dressed in a makeshift uniform and sitting on horseback with a red umbrella across his saddle, Minim has only to appear in the hills so recently dominated by Italian troops to strengthen his subjects. As he is instructed by the comrade who has helped to hatch the plan: “To be in the presence of our emperor is to stand before the sun. You must respect his power to give you life and burn you alive.”</p><p>A different novel might put this curious interlude at its heart; fiction as written by a popular historian such as, say, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/sep/19/the-spy-and-the-traitor-by-ben-macintyre-review" title="">Ben Mcintyre</a>. But in Mengiste’s story - which draws on her own family history, with a grandfather who fought against the Italians – shadows and echoes abound and multiply, ensuring that although its participants are faced with clear and present danger, they continue to be intimately bound to the generations and individuals that have gone before them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/18/the-shadow-king-by-maaza-mengiste-review">Continue reading...</a>

Just before the new year, as part of a series I am filming, I watched a game of basketball and enjoyed it more than almost any other sporting event I have attended. This was a huge surprise. I have always been cynical about Brits who like American sports; hipsters prancing about in their Chicago Bulls vests and trying to recreate White Men Can’t Jump in Burgess Hill. But now I think they might be right.</p><p>I still love football, of course. All of the things I love in life I have loved for the longest time: hip-hop, Arsenal, comic books, gaming, breakfast cereal, leaving phone chargers in hotels. But this is the first time in years that I have got into something new. I had assumed that my interests were now ring-fenced, like my friendship group. To become friends with anyone new at this stage, we would have to have a connection better than the one I have with my wife. In all honesty, I’m much more in the market to cull some of my current ones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/18/ive-fallen-for-nba-basketball-romesh-ranganathan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ahead of his new standup show, the Catastrophe star discusses returning to comedy after tragedy, defending the NHS and becoming a better dad</p><p>Rob Delaney is on a canoe, sailing down the North American waterways with a massive lump of cheese in his mouth. Not literally; that would be a weird place to do an interview. But in his head he’s there now, reminiscing about a pivotal point in his life. “It was 25 years ago. And the friend I was with took out his cheese and a knife, sliced off a piece and gave me some. I remember saying: ‘Man, this is good,’ and he said: ‘Yeah, food tastes better when you share it.’” It was in that moment that Delaney believes his core principles were formed. “I don’t even remember his name,” he laughs. “He’s just Canoe Cheese Man to me.”</p><p>And yet Delaney is reminded of the guy’s impact on a regular basis. When we meet – slightly more boringly for coffee in a bar near his home in north London – the 42-year-old comic is still raw from December’s election results. Delaney had campaigned for Labour with a moving video extolling the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/04/american-nhs-vote-boris-johnson-tories">brilliance of our NHS</a>. “I have a potentially unique perspective in the sense that as my career was taking off and I was being surrounded by wealthier and wealthier people, my son got sick too,” he says. “Then he got incredibly sick, then disabled, and then he died. I was spending time with people who were disabled, dying, often people who were much less materially fortunate than myself. Having a foot in these two worlds gave me a perspective on just how unequal things are.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/18/as-my-career-took-off-my-son-got-sick-rob-delaney-catastrophe">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I used to prefer dating tall men, but now I’m urging women to start lowering their height expectations </p><p>This week, the actor Jameela Jamil said she wants to see less dating stereotypes on screen. Instead of the usual pretty-women-meets-handsome-man trope, she wants to see love between able-bodied and disabled characters, mixed-race love and, why not, tall women with short men.</p><p>It is with much shame that I admit to having been one of <em>those</em> women: the ones who judge the attractiveness of a partner as proportional to his height. My old online dating bio used to carry the tagline “six foot and above only”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/18/why-women-should-date-short-men">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Seven years ago, my 14-year-old son, Kadian, was killed in a road accident. This is the advice I’d give myself back then</p><p>When I was asked recently to speak about my “grief journey” to a group of bereaved parents, my first reaction was that it wasn’t such a good idea. I was very worried that it would trigger something in me. Because seven years ago, I watched my 14-year-old son Kadian ride down a hill on a bicycle, and into a road where he was struck by a truck. He died in front of me.</p><p>I was also anxious about making generalisations – after all, everyone’s experience is different. There is no blueprint or boilerplate for how to cope with such a calamity. I didn’t want to cause anyone additional pain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/18/keep-close-always-how-survived-loss-teenage-son-thomas-harding">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Les Mots à La Bouche’s move from the Marais shows loss of cultural heritage, activists say </p><p>In the window of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a>’s best-known gay bookshop, above the display of Lucian Freud art books, opera singer Maria Callas’s memoirs and a history of the Pride movement, a poster warns in giant red letters: “Cultural heritage in danger.” An urgent note on the door adds: “We need your help!”</p><p><a href="https://motsbouche.com/">Les Mots à La Bouche</a>, a 40-year-old Paris institution, is the top LGBT bookshop in France and considered one of the best in the world – a focal point of Paris’s historic gay neighbourhood in the Marais district.

<p>The Clarence House Chase sees two top talents facing off again following last month’s Sandown thriller</p><p>Every great race deserves a replay and last month’s thrilling Tingle Creek could be played out once more at Ascot, where the first and second face each other in the Clarence House Chase. <strong>Defi Du Seuil</strong> (3.35) is rightly favourite to come out on top again.</p><p>This could be called an away game for him, as he was beaten at odds-on when he last ran at Ascot, whereas Un De Sceaux is a triple winner of this race. But Defi’s yard was under a cloud when he flopped here in 2017 and he has since made up into an exciting chaser. With Philip Hobbs’s runners in great form, he should get his third win of the season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/18/talking-horses-defi-du-seuil-un-de-sceaux-ascot-clarence-house-chase">Continue reading...</a>
