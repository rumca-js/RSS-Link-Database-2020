I liked it quite a bit. It's like a mini workstation with 2.0 GB of PCM data that can be stacked and sequenced in wild ways. \n\nHere's the footage of me surfing presets and making tweaks while playing. It's a little raw, but there are some really fun moments.\n\nI want one. Please, Korg, notice me.\n------------------------------------\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\nT-Shirts: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5HY5-PgySU", "date_published": "2020-01-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UChnxLLvzviaR5NeKOevB8iQ", "title": "Surfing the ASM Hydrasynth at NAMM 2020", "description": "I touched an ASM Hydrasynth for the first time at NAMM 2020.
