Gets.\nSince the days of our ancestors fearing mother nature - fearing and believing a higher power or divinity has been a part of what makes humans, human.\nAnd as the famous historian and philosopher Will Durant puts it, religion \u201cgives man a belief that will enable him to tolerate life\u201d\n\nTHIS. Is the business we\u2019re in. We\u2019re not selling sermons, We\u2019re not selling church choirs\nNo, no, no. We\u2019re in the business of selling hope. Selling salvation. Selling community. Selling the ability to tolerate the difficulties of life.\nAnd when you\u2019re viewed as the benevolent authority on hope, the afterlife, salvation, you\u2019re customers are gonna take you pretty seriously.\n\nIhe direr the need, the more people are willing to pay.\nYou may not be willing to pay $850,000 for a glorified watch\u2026\nBut what about for a cancer treatment?\n\nThat\u2019s the power of religion.\nNot only is it so deep in the human condition, but you get to sell to society\u2019s most vulnerable people with the most dire needs.\n\nBut the benefits don\u2019t stop there, because you\u2019re protected by the government\nFor all the other plebs out there, the IRS may seem like your worst enemy, but to churches, they\u2019re your guardian angel\n\nThat means, like we mentioned earlier, the business of religion puts the greatest tax havens on Earth like the Cayman Islands, to shame. You don\u2019t have to worry about that pesty FTC looking into your sketchy business practices. \n\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote // http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
