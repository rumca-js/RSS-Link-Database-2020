What if I told you that you could start a business that 
Was except from paying any federal, state, local, or property taxes
Your customers treated you like holy divinity and shower you with cash every time you walk into the room
Your customers will willingly pay for you to live in multi-million dollar homes tax free
And you’re in a position where you’re able to openly ask your customers to pay for $54 million private jets
Well get your bibles out, loosen up those morals, bc this is how to be a preacher profiteer

The Business of Religion

Being a Preacher Profiteer is just like any other business - it helps if you understand your customers and your market
And much like the business of war, the business of religion is as primal. as. it. Gets.
Since the days of our ancestors fearing mother nature - fearing and believing a higher power or divinity has been a part of what makes humans, human.
And as the famous historian and philosopher Will Durant puts it, religion “gives man a belief that will enable him to tolerate life”

THIS. Is the business we’re in. We’re not selling sermons, We’re not selling church choirs
No, no, no. We’re in the business of selling hope. Selling salvation. Selling community. Selling the ability to tolerate the difficulties of life.
And when you’re viewed as the benevolent authority on hope, the afterlife, salvation, you’re customers are gonna take you pretty seriously.

Ihe direr the need, the more people are willing to pay.
You may not be willing to pay $850,000 for a glorified watch…
But what about for a cancer treatment?

That’s the power of religion.
Not only is it so deep in the human condition, but you get to sell to society’s most vulnerable people with the most dire needs.

But the benefits don’t stop there, because you’re protected by the government
For all the other plebs out there, the IRS may seem like your worst enemy, but to churches, they’re your guardian angel

That means, like we mentioned earlier, the business of religion puts the greatest tax havens on Earth like the Cayman Islands, to shame. You don’t have to worry about that pesty FTC looking into your sketchy business practices.
