<p>The day is nearing when, if he were so minded, Jürgen Klopp could copy his strategy for FA Cup replays and hand the rest of Liverpool’s league season to their second string. Games in hand are only an advantage if you win them and this one was ultimately negotiated in comfort, confirming a 19-point lead that only a wild-eyed fantasist would deem surmountable.</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/premierleague/table" title="">Nineteen points ahead</a>; 23 wins from 24; all 19 Premier League teams defeated at least once. They are statistics that will swill around for the rest of this week but they should not dull in the telling, even if the figures are likely to grow yet more jawdropping in the months to come. Liverpool did not please Klopp with this display and they certainly laboured in the 35 minutes before Mohamed Salah put them ahead from the penalty spot. The number of mistakes that crept in, even once Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had doubled the lead, was enough to afford Alisson the platform to remind everyone that his excellence underpins the imperturbable machine that ploughs on in front of him. But none of it mattered too much: West Ham were allowed their moments, but this is emphatically Liverpool’s season.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/west-ham-united-liverpool-premier-league-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Remember Paris, Pep Guardiola had cautioned after his Manchester City team’s 3-1 first-leg victory at Old Trafford in this Carabao Cup semi-final. Remember Paris, Ole Gunnar Solskjær had trumpeted in the countdown to the second leg. It could be done. His Manchester United had done it before – in last season’s Champions League last 16 when they overturned a two-goal deficit from the home leg to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/06/paris-saint-germain-manchester-united-champions-league-last-16-second-leg-match-report" title="">upset Paris Saint-Germain</a> in frankly ludicrous fashion.</p><p>This game should not have been close. City’s superiority was plain for so long but a combination of United’s doggedness and their own profligacy ensured that it went down to the wire. City had two goals ruled out for offside and some of their misses had Guardiola and the home support contorting in agony.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/29/manchester-city-manchester-united-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A two-state solution came about as the result of a rules-based world order, which Mr Trump detests because it is inimical to the raw power that he prefers to govern global affairs</p><p>Donald Trump’s Arab-Israeli <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51292865" title="">peace plan</a> rests upon the absurdity of the Palestinians accepting a state in name alone. Since 1993’s Oslo accords, hope had been kindled that a “Palestine” could be created from most of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, with its capital in East Jerusalem. The Trump administration’s <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/peacetoprosperity/" title="">document</a> pays lip service to such an entity while shrinking its size and mutilating its scope to non-existence. It envisages the potential transfer of Palestinian towns out of Israel. It contains a blatant attempt to stop Palestinians seeking justice for war crimes – including those currently under way.

He once <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-51263815" title="">warned</a> Israel would be in mortal danger if a viable Palestine existed alongside it.

The old gibe against the Palestinians – that they never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity for peace – is singularly inappropriate. Mr Trump’s blatant support for Israel and his snub of the Palestinians in drafting his plan has let Mr Netanyahu do whatever he wants.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/29/the-guardian-view-on-trumps-peace-plan-a-con-not-a-deal">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The British empire forced its colonies to abandon their own languages. Now they are making English their own</p><p>There is one expression I have grown up hearing from relatives of a certain age, but never been able to accept. It’s the description of Twi – the Akan language spoken by my family – as “the vernacular”, a term which implicitly compares it with the colonial language, English, and somehow finds it wanting. The word itself is a revealing symptom of the colonial project. Just as nations like the Yoruba, with a population of more than 40 million, were patronisingly described as “tribes”, when in fact they were substantial nations, African languages were downgraded to “the vernacular”. It’s a term more befitting of a regional dialect than a nation’s language, with its own history, politics and literature.</p><p>The attempt to discourage Africans from speaking our own languages not only failed, but has had the glorious result of backfiring, to the extent that now Britain’s own inhabitants are officially adopting African vocab.

Andrzej and Zofia Pilecki knew nothing about the mission that had taken their father away from them for most of their childhood. It was only when they were in their 60s, as the iron curtain fell, that the details of Witold Pilecki’s extraordinary second world war mission began to emerge.</p><p>Then, in 2012, a British war correspondent who was looking for a new subject after covering wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, stumbled across the story. He discovered that Pilecki, a former cavalry officer, had become a leading member of the Polish resistance – and deliberately got himself interned in Auschwitz so that he could send intelligence to London. He survived that ordeal only to fall into the hands of the Soviet regime, who took possession of Poland in the postwar carve-up of Europe.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/29/costa-winner-auschwitz-book-witold-pilecki-jack-fairweather-the-volunteer">Continue reading...</a>

## Next in Fashion review – Alexa Chung and Tan France's reality show is bang on trend

<p>Perfectly tailored for binge-watching, this thrilling Netflix contest combines bold designs, big prizes ... and bloody hands</p><p>If there’s one thing streaming services might have been expected to leave alone, it’s competitive reality TV. Unlike a thriller, or a drama, competitions suit a weekly rollout. You spend a while getting to know the contestants, so you can really root for them, and it’s far easier to be forgiving of the necessarily repetitive nature of the format when it is spaced out in the right way. It’s hard to imagine The Masked Singer, say, working in a dumped block of episodes, because few could stomach it all in one go. But in its bid to be all things to all people, Netflix keeps churning out competitions, in baking, cooking and even glass-blowing. And, in part thanks to big names and seemingly big budgets, they keep working. <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81026300" title="">Next in Fashion</a>, a take-me-seriously-but-not-too-seriously update of Project Catwalk/Runway, is not about to break that pattern.</p><p>Over 10 episodes, Next in Fashion sets out to find a hot new designer. But these are no amateurs. Each of the 18 contestants has considerable experience in the industry. Some have worked as “ghost designers” for celebrity labels, others for established names, and some just never quite got the break they needed. Only one does not have their own label yet. As is the way with Netflix competitions, the contestants are international – from Mexico, the US, the UK, India, Italy, South Korea and plenty more. This is one of the best aspects of this new glut of reality: why make several localised versions, when you can just mix the competitors in one?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/29/next-in-fashion-review-alexa-chung-and-tan-frances-outrageously-ott-reality-tv">Continue reading...</a>

## Don’t call off the rottweiler: why now is not the time for tame political interviews

<p>The director general of the BBC says he prefers a more gentle style to interviews. But the levels of dishonesty and evasiveness among today’s politicians demand a whole new approach<br /></p><p>‘I’m a great believer in the long-form political interview where you can explore at length, not in soundbites, the real policy decisions that politicians are making,” said Lord Tony Hall on Tuesday, as he prepares to depart as BBC director general. He went on to criticise interviewers who try to catch politicians out, concluding that it militates against nuance and contributes to our toxic political atmosphere. </p><p>It is a familiar debate: do you favour Jeremy Paxman’s rottweiler, Cathy Newman’s velociraptor, Andrew Neil’s Godzilla, Evan Davis’s kindly-but-impartial shrink or Andrew Marr’s tough start but no follow-up? People who love Paxman say that he holds politicians to account. That was true in the exact moment it happened – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwlsd8RAoqI" title="">with Michael Howard in 1997</a> – since it paraded the Tory politician’s evasiveness. At the same time, it set the bar for all media training since. The bridge manoeuvre – take a word from the question and use it to pivot to a different question that you then answer – originated in this moment of shame and nobody has ever been had in precisely that way again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2020/jan/29/dont-call-off-the-rottweiler-why-now-is-not-the-time-for-tame-political-interviews">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His childhood was mired by abuse he could never divulge. But he went on to countless triumphs</p><p>In many people’s minds, Michael Cashman – actor, activist, MEP, co-founder of Stonewall and member of the House of Lords – will always be associated with a kiss. In 1985, he had been approached by the creators of EastEnders, Julia Smith and Tony Holland, to play Colin Russell – the British soap’s first gay character. Cashman was nervous at the thought of the press scrutiny that could follow, but agreed. Even before his character was announced, the Sun ran a story about the role under the headline “Eastbenders”.</p><p>“What made it worse,” says Cashman, now 69 and sitting in his fourth-floor Limehouse apartment overlooking the Thames, “was the information was leaked from inside.” The Sunday Mirror, meanwhile, claimed that he had had an HIV test in the US and was dying. The News of the World ran a double-page spread, headlined “Secret Gay Love of Aids Scare EastEnder”, which outed his partner and printed the couple’s photos and address.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/29/michael-cashman-abuse-invisible-sign-eastenders">Continue reading...</a>

From washing out plastic bags to repackaging tissues, Guardian readers offer some more unusual tips for cutting down on waste<p>Could your garden be the key to your zero-waste ambitions? Gardeners at the National Trust’s Knightshayes estate in Devon have grown luffa plants <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/press-release/national-trust-staff-harvest-first-crop-of-grow-your-own-kitchen-sponges" title="">to produce their own sponges</a> in an attempt to cut down on waste. They are as easy to cultivate as courgettes, according to the kitchen garden supervisor, Bev Todd. Just sow the seeds in April or May in a warm and sunny spot, and give the plant a support to scramble up. Once the fruit matures and withers, squeeze it to loosen, and peel off the skin. Wash and remove the seeds and flesh, hang to dry and <em>voilà</em> – your own sustainable sponge.</p><p>If you find that inspiring, Zoë Morrison, a blogger and the author of <a href="https://ecothriftyliving.com/">Eco Thrifty Living</a>, has another green-fingered suggestion: “I like to regrow vegetables from their bottoms, so that they can be saved from the bin or the compost heap.” She has successfully regrown lettuce, celery and leeks this way.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jan/29/grow-your-own-sponges-and-other-innovative-ways-to-live-more-sustainably">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A growing number of men are pursuing parenthood through surrogacy, adoption or fostering – without a partner. Here, dads who have gone it alone share their stories</p><p>The first night Joe Norton brought home his adoptive sons, Tarren and Owen, he considered his new life, then thought: what have I done? “It’s a monumental decision you’re making, and you’re making it on your own,” says the 54-year-old educational manager from Yorkshire. “The enormity hit me.”</p><p>Going from being a single man to the sole carer for two children was tougher than he had expected. There was the misbehaviour, particularly when the boys, who are brothers, began to settle in. (Experts call this period “regression”, but it is usually a sign that children are beginning to relax around their new parents.) He was also stumped by unexpected questions – what size socks did the boys wear? Norton had no clue what to buy. “You have an idea what size a T-shirt should be, but socks are a different thing,” he says, chuckling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/29/i-always-wanted-to-be-a-dad-the-rise-of-single-fathers-by-choice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>John Palmer was the Guardian’s correspondent in Brussels in 1973 when the UK entered the European Economic Community. Now, 46 years later, Jennifer Rankin is in Brussels for the Guardian as British MEPs are packing up and leaving. They tell Anushka Asthana how membership has changed Britain. Plus: Dan Sabbagh on Huawei’s role in British infrastructure</p><p>From the moment Britain entered the European Economic Community in 1973, the question of how closely to align with other European countries has been a vexed one. Britain emphatically voted to remain in the club in a referendum in 1975 but throughout the 1980s the relationship began to fray. By the 2000s, Britain had opted to remain outside the single currency and support for the separatist UK Independence party was growing until David Cameron took the fateful decision to call a referendum on membership of what was then a 27-member European Union. </p><p><strong>John Palmer </strong>was the Guardian’s Brussels correspondent in 1973 as Britain entered the EEC. He tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> that he remembers it as a time when Britain was investing in its European future and it was Labour and not the Conservatives that was most wary of what was then primarily a free-trade zone. Now, as Britain prepares to leave the EU on Friday, Brussels correspondent <strong>Jennifer Rankin </strong>describes how British MEPs are packing up and leaving town. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/29/from-entry-to-exit-what-did-eu-membership-mean-for-britain-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
