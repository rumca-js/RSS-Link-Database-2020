Unlike a thriller, or a drama, competitions suit a weekly rollout. You spend a while getting to know the contestants, so you can really root for them, and it\u2019s far easier to be forgiving of the necessarily repetitive nature of the format when it is spaced out in the right way. It\u2019s hard to imagine The Masked Singer, say, working in a dumped block of episodes, because few could stomach it all in one go. But in its bid to be all things to all people, Netflix keeps churning out competitions, in baking, cooking and even glass-blowing. And, in part thanks to big names and seemingly big budgets, they keep working. <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81026300\" title=\"\">Next in Fashion</a>, a take-me-seriously-but-not-too-seriously update of Project Catwalk/Runway, is not about to break that pattern.</p><p>Over 10 episodes, Next in Fashion sets out to find a hot new designer.

As is the way with Netflix competitions, the contestants are international \u2013 from Mexico, the US, the UK, India, Italy, South Korea and plenty more. This is one of the best aspects of this new glut of reality: why make several localised versions, when you can just mix the competitors in one?</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/29/next-in-fashion-review-alexa-chung-and-tan-frances-outrageously-ott-reality-tv\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/29/next-in-fashion-review-alexa-chung-and-tan-frances-outrageously-ott-reality-tv", "date_published": "2020-01-29 15:35:23+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "BBC announces 450 jobs will go in newsroom shake-up", "description": "<p>BBC to cover fewer stories and centralise programme-making in effort to save \u00a380m</p><p>The BBC has said it will cut 450 jobs from its news operation and cover fewer stories as part of an effort to save \u00a380m, as executives warned that the corporation is facing an unprecedented threat to its future.</p><p>The head of news, Fran Unsworth, announced on Wednesday that journalists at the corporation would increasingly be pooled in centralised teams rather than working for specific programmes, with an increased emphasis on its online output rather than its television and radio stations.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/29/bbc-announces-450-jobs-will-go-in-newsroom-shake-up\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jan/29/bbc-announces-450-jobs-will-go-in-newsroom-shake-up", "date_published": "2020-01-29 15:21:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Britons getting out before Brexit \u2018drawbridge\u2019 goes up", "description": "<p>UK nationals rush to settle in Spain before they lose their rights as EU citizens on 31 December<br /></p><p>Campaigners for the rights of British nationals in Spain have reported a rise in the number of inquiries from people rushing through plans to establish residency in the country before the Brexit \u201cdrawbridge goes up\u201d.</p><p>Sue Wilson, the founder of campaign group Bremain in Spain, says now that Brexit is \u201cconcrete and is happening\u201d they are seeing evidence of Britons \u201cexpediting their plans\u201d for retirement or a career move to Spain.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/29/the-britons-getting-out-before-brexit-drawbridge-goes-up\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/29/the-britons-getting-out-before-brexit-drawbridge-goes-up", "date_published": "2020-01-29 15:00:50+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Can a celebratory Brexit tea towel help heal the nation?", "description": "<p>From mugs to badges, the Conservative party are flogging merchandise to commemorate Brexit.
