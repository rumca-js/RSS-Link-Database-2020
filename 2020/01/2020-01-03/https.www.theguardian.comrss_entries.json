Travel writer Lizzie Pook shares her tips for starting your holiday as you mean to go on</p><p><strong>Have a planning party<br /></strong>If there was ever an excuse for a party, a holiday is it, and there can be something quite ceremonial about plotting your annual escape from the drudgery of everyday life. So make an occasion of your holiday planning. Take care over it. Set some time aside, throw some snacks in the oven, round up your family, other half, group of friends, or pour yourself a glass of something fancy if you\u2019re travelling solo, and actively brainstorm holiday activity ideas. If one of you fancies horse riding at sunset on a footprint-free beach \u2013 whack it on the list. Heard of a must-visit farm-to-table restaurant in that tiny French village you\u2019re heading to? Get in touch with them; see if you can make a reservation. You don\u2019t have to plan everything to a tee (unless you\u2019re a laminated itinerary kind of traveller, and that\u2019s fine too), but making an occasion of plotting, and getting excited about your upcoming trip will make you value it (and the people you\u2019re sharing it with) even more.</p><p><strong>Book through one provider<br /></strong>It can be tempting to take a scattergun approach to booking your holiday; a train trip here, a hotel there. But booking through one provider not only makes the process less stressful and more streamlined, it also means that if you come up against any niggles along the way (such as last-minute cancellations or unforeseen delays), they are easily ironed out because one company is overseeing everything. With <a href=\"https://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/holidays\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brittany Ferries Holidays</a> you can book it all \u2013 from ferry journeys to quaint rental gites \u2013 in one go, with sailings from Portsmouth, Poole and Plymouth to multiple ports on the picturesque west coast of Europe.

Her parents split when she was eight years old and she moved to Colorado Springs with her mother. Then she realised she was living with a hoarder. It might have been grief over the lost marriage that caused it, or maybe it was a habit that had grown worse as her mother\u2019s dependence on drugs and alcohol intensified. On the kitchen table there were piles of clothes stacked all the way to the ceiling, things they would get for free from churches or charities. Furniture that Andersen\u2019s well-meaning grandmother found on the street accumulated. An avalanche of pots and pans spilled all over the kitchen counters and floor. Anything her mother could get for free or cheap, she would bring into the house and leave there.</p><p>As a child, Andersen kept her own space under control, but, beyond her bedroom door, the mess persisted. At 17, she left home, joined the air force and moved to New Mexico. Over time, her career took her to Alaska and then to Ohio, where she now lives with her husband, Shane, and works as an aerospace physiology technician. But the anxiety over her oppressive surroundings at home never left. Clutter was creeping back in, she realised, even though this time she thought she was fully in control.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/03/empty-promises-marie-kondo-craze-for-minimalism\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/03/empty-promises-marie-kondo-craze-for-minimalism", "date_published": "2020-01-03 06:00:56+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'We are not safe': India's Muslims tell of wave of police brutality", "description": "<p>Police in Uttar Pradesh state have embarked on \u2018reign of terror\u2019 against Muslims in wake of new citizenship law</p><p>It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised.
