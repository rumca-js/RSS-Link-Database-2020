<p>The next party leader will have to go to the places that rejected us, and win the argument. That’s why I’m standing<br />• Lisa Nandy is Labour MP for Wigan</p><p>We are out of power and on the rocks. The shattering collapse in trust among lifelong Labour voters has been a long time coming. Now is not the time to steady the ship or try not to oversteer. Unless we change course, we will become irrelevant.</p><p>This change starts with empowering people to make change themselves. We’ve been a decade out of power in Westminster, changing our leaders, and commissioning reports and focus groups from offices in central London just to hear what is happening in the country. If we were trying to reinforce the sense that we just don’t get it, we couldn’t do better than this.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/03/labour-power-activism-leader">Continue reading...</a>

## Five ways to start enjoying your holiday before you even get there

<p>Holidays should be relaxing, but all too often they end up being incredibly stressful in the run-up. Travel writer Lizzie Pook shares her tips for starting your holiday as you mean to go on</p><p><strong>Have a planning party<br /></strong>If there was ever an excuse for a party, a holiday is it, and there can be something quite ceremonial about plotting your annual escape from the drudgery of everyday life. So make an occasion of your holiday planning. Take care over it. Set some time aside, throw some snacks in the oven, round up your family, other half, group of friends, or pour yourself a glass of something fancy if you’re travelling solo, and actively brainstorm holiday activity ideas. If one of you fancies horse riding at sunset on a footprint-free beach – whack it on the list. Heard of a must-visit farm-to-table restaurant in that tiny French village you’re heading to? Get in touch with them; see if you can make a reservation. You don’t have to plan everything to a tee (unless you’re a laminated itinerary kind of traveller, and that’s fine too), but making an occasion of plotting, and getting excited about your upcoming trip will make you value it (and the people you’re sharing it with) even more.</p><p><strong>Book through one provider<br /></strong>It can be tempting to take a scattergun approach to booking your holiday; a train trip here, a hotel there. But booking through one provider not only makes the process less stressful and more streamlined, it also means that if you come up against any niggles along the way (such as last-minute cancellations or unforeseen delays), they are easily ironed out because one company is overseeing everything. With <a href="https://www.brittany-ferries.co.uk/holidays" rel="nofollow">Brittany Ferries Holidays</a> you can book it all – from ferry journeys to quaint rental gites – in one go, with sailings from Portsmouth, Poole and Plymouth to multiple ports on the picturesque west coast of Europe. It’s Abta-protected and offers everything from motorcycle tours and family camping holidays to disability-friendly trips and golfing breaks. So whether you’re off to Aquitaine or País Vasco, keep it together, your stress levels will thank you.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/the-joy-of-slow-travel/2020/jan/03/five-ways-to-start-enjoying-your-holiday-before-you-even-get-there">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From the ‘KonMari method’ to Apple’s barely-there design philosophy, we are forever being urged to declutter and simplify our lives. But does minimalism really make us any happier? By Kyle Chayka</p><p>Sonrisa Andersen’s childhood home was a mess. Her parents split when she was eight years old and she moved to Colorado Springs with her mother. Then she realised she was living with a hoarder. It might have been grief over the lost marriage that caused it, or maybe it was a habit that had grown worse as her mother’s dependence on drugs and alcohol intensified. On the kitchen table there were piles of clothes stacked all the way to the ceiling, things they would get for free from churches or charities. Furniture that Andersen’s well-meaning grandmother found on the street accumulated. An avalanche of pots and pans spilled all over the kitchen counters and floor. Anything her mother could get for free or cheap, she would bring into the house and leave there.</p><p>As a child, Andersen kept her own space under control, but, beyond her bedroom door, the mess persisted. At 17, she left home, joined the air force and moved to New Mexico. Over time, her career took her to Alaska and then to Ohio, where she now lives with her husband, Shane, and works as an aerospace physiology technician. But the anxiety over her oppressive surroundings at home never left. Clutter was creeping back in, she realised, even though this time she thought she was fully in control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/03/empty-promises-marie-kondo-craze-for-minimalism">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Police in Uttar Pradesh state have embarked on ‘reign of terror’ against Muslims in wake of new citizenship law</p><p>It was midnight at a police barracks in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh and in a freezing windowless room about 150 Muslim men and boys sat huddled, bloodied and bruised. Some of the shivering prisoners had raw gashes across their hands and faces, others had broken limbs splayed out at awkward angles. The beatings from police came frequently, according to multiple corresponding accounts; to those who asked for water or closed their eyes in drowsiness or simply did nothing at all. Over and over, metal rods and bamboo canes hit soft human skin. Some had been stripped of their clothes. The youngest among them was just 12 years old, said witnesses.</p><p>How hundreds of innocent Muslim residents of the city of Muzaffarnagar came to be rounded up on 20 December, before being tortured in police detention, is part of what Indian activist and academic Yogendra Yadav described as an unprecedented and ruthless “reign of terror” imposed upon the country’s most populous state over the past two weeks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/we-are-not-safe-indias-muslims-tell-of-wave-of-police-brutality">Continue reading...</a>
