## Leicester’s Kelechi Iheanacho rescues draw in face of defiant Aston Villa

<p>Brendan Rodgers warned that his evolving side would not get anywhere without learning how to suffer. Aston Villa sure put them to the test here, as they defied the form book and a spate of injuries to inflict serious hardship on Leicester. Frédéric Guilbert’s goal even looked like giving Villa a lead to take into the second leg in three weeks but Kelechi Iheanacho came off the bench for an equaliser that leaves this Carabao Cup semi-final intriguingly poised.</p><p>This was a far tighter contest than expected and nothing like the Premier League encounter a month ago at Villa Park, where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/08/aston-villa-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report" title="">Leicester sashayed to a 4-1 victory</a>. A repeat of that would have been no surprise given the wretched luck that has beset Villa during a spell when they have lost most of their spine to injury, including Tom Heaton, John McGinn and Wesley. Their lineup on Wednesday included no specialist striker, as Jonathan Kodjia was omitted from the squad after falling ill, according to Dean Smith.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/08/leicester-aston-villa-carabao-cup-semi-final-first-leg-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

Donald Trump may have de-escalated (for now), but Boris Johnson has already proved to be weak in the face of US hawkishness<p>So the war is off – at least for now. Donald Trump, in his bottomless wisdom, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/08/trump-backs-away-from-further-military-confrontation-iran" title="">informed a grateful world today</a> that he was graciously declining to destroy Iran after its modest airstrikes on US bases in Iraq. This being Trump, it could change, of course, in a matter of hours. Today peace, tomorrow who knows? For nothing fundamental in this needless, irrationally, hateful confrontation has changed. There is still no plan, no obvious diplomatic route, no peace process. Only a list of harsh American demands with menaces.</p><p>For Britain, Trump’s White House speech had particular chastening import. It marked the moment when the remnants of an independent British policy towards Iran were finally and brutally flattened. Despite the marginally less aggressive tone, a speeding American freight train, driven by a crazed engineer, is heading down the tracks towards Tehran. And Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/08/boris-johnson-strongly-backs-us-decision-to-kill-qassem-suleimani" title="">appears mesmerised at the spectacle</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/iran-britain-donald-trump-boris-johnson">Continue reading...</a>

Many will feel that they know too much about him rather than too little.</p><p>But there is a danger that politics may not be keeping up with the way he is evolving as prime minister. On the right, Johnson is still the conquering hero. He won the Brexit battle, trounced the liberal establishment and has led the Conservatives back to a level of power they have not known for 30 years. On the left, Johnson is the villain of the era. He has hitched his ambition to a rightwing nationalist deregulatory project, and he is a Trump admirer who does not care what gets in his way, or who suffers, as long as he wins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/08/boris-johnson-right-left-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Since returning with a female Doctor, the sci-fi smash has been accused of political correctness. But, as recent storylines prove, the truth is far worse<br /></p><p>Doctor Who <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/01/doctor-who-spyfall-review-only-jodie-whittaker-can-save-blighty-now">returned last week</a> with another first: Sacha Dhawan’s casting as the first person of colour to play the Doctor’s arch nemesis, the Master. The decision was broadly met with praise, but in darker corners of the internet the argument that the show has become too politically correct rages on.</p><p>“Too PC” has become a familiar jibe levelled at the sci-fi hit since 2018 when Jodie Whittaker became the Thirteenth Doctor and new showrunner Chris Chibnall took up the mantle. As well as the first woman to play the title role, their first series featured two BAME companions and episodes about Rosa Parks and the partition of India, written by Doctor Who’s first ever BAME writers. The show quickly found itself embroiled in a culture war, with talk of its apparent political correctness becoming commonplace (see the Twitter hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NotMyDoctor">#notmydoctor</a>). Whittaker and Chibnall were forced to <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/television/doctor-who-jodie-whittaker-chris-chibnall-interview-new-series-1350321">defend</a> the show against these claims before this series began: Whittaker reminded viewers that there’s “still racism within our current society”, and Chibnall added that “the Doctor and the show are beacons of compassion and empathy”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/08/doctor-who-more-offensive-than-ever-jodie-whittaker-pc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Guardian columnist Owen Jones describes the way political debate in Britain has become increasingly divisive and how abuse is now a daily occurrence for most people involved in it. Plus: Helen Pidd on the sentencing of Britain’s most prolific rapist</p><p>Last August the Guardian columnist <strong>Owen Jones</strong> suffered a horrendous attack as he was out in London celebrating his birthday. In December three men admitted to the charge of affray. Next week a judge will decide whether one of the men, James Healy, was motivated by Jones’s sexuality. </p><p>Jones is convinced it will not be the last time he is attacked, and that is because he has become accustomed to being a target in person and online. In the past year he’s been repeatedly taunted in the street, including with homophobic abuse. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jan/08/owen-jones-toxic-politics-target-abuse">Continue reading...</a>
