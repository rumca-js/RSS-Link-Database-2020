But this month the schedules are destined to become that little bit more hallucinatory thanks to The Masked Singer, a show that makes that time Dale Winton forced celebrities to hurl themselves through holes in a giant foam wall seem like an entirely rational and restrained way to entertain a nation.</p><p>A fur-coated Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a format, The Masked Singer takes a cast of celebrities and conceals their identity behind elaborate and frequently terrifying animal costumes. These disguised celebs then have to sing before a panel of (also) celebrity detectives, who are tasked with divining the star behind the disguise. In each episode, via a complex judging process, one contestant is unmasked to squeals of frenzied excitement. Essentially, Saturday night TV is about to be filled with the sight of a giant rubber duck performing Like a Virgin in a conical bra, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/jonathan-ross\">Jonathan Ross</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/jan/30/davina-mccall-this-much-know\">Davina McCall</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/rita-ora\">Rita Ora</a> and The Hangover star <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/12/ken-jeong-nude-scenes-the-hangover-standup-adelphi-theatre-london\">Ken Jeong</a> make wild, baseless guesses about the bird\u2019s true identity.
