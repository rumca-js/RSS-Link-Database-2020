## Paul Mullin seals stunning comeback draw for Tranmere at Watford

<p>League One strugglers Tranmere battled back from three goals down at Vicarage Road to take Premier League Watford to an FA Cup third round replay. The Hornets looked to be cruising at half-time. Expert finishes from Tom Dele-Bashiru, Nathaniel Chalobah and Roberto Pereyra had the home side 3-0 up, with Tranmere contributing to their own downfall. But the hosts took their eyes off the ball in the second half and Micky Mellon’s men punished them with two goals from set pieces and a penalty awarded by VAR turning the match on its head.</p><p>The scoring started in the 12th minute and was all too easy for the hosts. Watford had won their first corner of the match after Adam Masina’s cross was blocked by Jake Caprice, and they took it short. Roberto Pereyra played it to Domingos Quina who in turn found Nathaniel Chalobah who slipped the ball to Tom Dele-Bashiru who was loitering 25 yards from goal. There was no one marking the 20-year-old former Manchester City prospect and no one interested in closing him down neither. Dele Bashiru took note, took a succession of small touches and then curled a sweet shot inside the left-hand post.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/04/watford-tranmere-fa-cup-match-report">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a six-year reissue project of the series reaches completion, Scottish author <em>Graeme Macrae Burnet </em>explains why Simenon’s Parisian sleuth still matters, 90 years after his first case</p><p>At the beginning of <em>Maigret and Monsieur Charles</em>, the 75th novel in Georges Simenon’s detective series, the celebrated inspector lines up his pipes on his desk. He plays with them for a while, arranging them into amusing shapes, before selecting one that suits his mood. He has just reached a decision on the future of his career. “He had no regrets, but even so he felt a certain sadness.”</p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/sep/25/georges-simenon-david-hare-la-main-red-stage-national-theatre-maigret" title="">Simenon</a> also began his writing day by lining up his pipes on his desk, and one cannot help but wonder if, as he wrote these lines, he too felt a certain sadness.

Sorry doesn’t have to be the hardest word, as Pope Francis proved after slapping the hand of a woman who grabbed him<p>On New Year’s Day, the Pope veered off script during his address to a packed St Peter’s Square to apologise for his behaviour the previous night. Unsurprisingly, this did not involve the traditional end-of-December misdemeanour of drinking excessively and vomiting on a host’s sofa. Instead, while greeting pilgrims at the Vatican on Tuesday evening, he <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jan/01/indignant-pope-francis-slaps-womans-hand-to-free-himself-at-new-years-eve-gathering-video" title="">slapped a woman’s hand</a> away after she grabbed him and yanked him towards her. He may have labelled the slap a “bad example” but, appropriately for a spiritual leader, the apology itself provided an immaculate blueprint for saying sorry.</p><p>Why was it so laudable? First, it came swiftly. Less than 24 hours after the incident. There was no whiff of hoping the fuss (inevitably, the slap had <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/pope-francis-slapping-bodyguards-security-new-year-eve-12228906" title="">sparked criticism</a> on social media) would blow over, nor of waiting for advisers to conjure a glib, legally watertight statement. Second, it was unequivocal. “So many times we lose patience – even me, and I apologise for yesterday’s bad example,” were his words in full. They contained no attempt to excuse or diminish the wrongdoing. He merely acknowledged his human fallibility, which may have chimed with those who have recently watched Netflix’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/01/the-two-popes-review-anthony-hopkins-jonathan-pryce-netflix" title="">The Two Popes</a></em>: the show offers an unsentimental portrait of how, in becoming pontiff, one is expected to have miraculously morphed from flawed human to spotless martyr.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/04/pope-apology-lesson-for-other-public-figures">Continue reading...</a>

## Why we need to blow a Raspberry at big tech… | John Naughton

The Raspberry Pi has notched up 30m sales – fulfilling the promise of user-controlled programming and inspiring children<p>I’m writing this on my nice new <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/sep/08/the-guardian-view-on-the-raspberry-pi-small-is-beautiful" title="">Raspberry Pi</a>. If you’re not a geek, this may suggest a columnist who has lost what remains of his marbles. But rest assured: I am not joking. The Pi is a fully functioning credit-card sized computer running a modern version of the Linux operating system. I bought it as a Christmas treat – and also as a project. The total cost – for the latest version, with 4GB of ram – was £114. For this, I got the highest-spec version of the motherboard, a keyboard and mouse, a micro-to-standard HDMI cable, a power supply, a case for the device, the official <em>Beginner’s Guide</em><em> </em>and a micro SD card with the operating system on it. All I needed was a TV or a monitor with an HDMI input (which I guess most households now possess).</p><p>I bought my Pi from the Raspberry Pi store in Cambridge. Across the street (and one floor below) is the Apple store where I had earlier gone to buy a new keyboard for one of my Macs. The cost: £99. So for £15 more, I had a desktop computer perfectly adequate for most of the things I need to do for my work.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/commentisfree/2020/jan/04/raspberry-pi-british-computer-computing-programming-children-technology">Continue reading...</a>

## 'I complained bitterly throughout': Sarah Perry on how she wrote The Essex Serpent

<p>During an afternoon drive through Essex, Perry learned about a 17th-century legend of a mysterious beast menacing the area. What if it came back?</p><p>I wrote the first draft between January and November 2014. I like to recall this as a period of effortless endeavour distinguished by ecstatic imaginative flights. I’ve been assured that in fact I complained bitterly throughout and emerged, visibly unwell, clutching a manuscript I declared unpublishable. Still: like a sundial, I only count the happy hours, and disregard this evidence.</p><p>Novelists famously bristle when asked where they get their ideas, but it’s a sensible question. I was 33, cheerfully impecunious, working as a copywriter and awaiting publication of my debut. I had no idea what my next book would be, until one afternoon, driving through the Essex countryside, I saw a sign to Henham village. “Ah,” said my husband: “The Essex serpent”, and discovering I was ignorant recounted the 17th century legend of a mysterious beast menacing the surrounding area. Instantly I experienced one of those vanishingly rare moments of inspiration which electrify the mind: what if it came back after Darwin? What if a London woman went looking for it – what if, down in Essex, there was a man of God more rational than the woman of science? Within 45 minutes I had all my major players and a good deal of the plot, and a feeling of quiet, if daunted, certainty.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/04/how-i-wrote-the-essex-serpent-sarah-perry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Last January Romesh Ranganathan decided he wanted to get fitter and feel better. Could he stick to his plan?</p><p>It has long been a source of amusement to my friends that I have maintained such a hefty bulk despite my veganism. It is true: I have taken being vegan as a sign that I shouldn’t deprive myself any further, and am guilty of gravitating towards the junk food end of the plant-based spectrum. I once ate four huge filled doughnuts in one sitting on the basis that vegans rarely get nice doughnuts, and “they were probably made of kale or something”.</p><p>A year ago, I decided something had to be done. My father died of a heart attack, and my body shape ticked all the boxes of someone headed the same way. There was another issue. My dissatisfaction with the way I look means I tend to wear one or two more layers of clothing than the season dictates. I can often be found at a bar sweating profusely, which, besides preferring the Crawley Pizza Express to the Woking branch, is another degree of separation I am proud to have from Prince Andrew.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/04/romesh-ranganathan-quinoa-pants-year-living-healthily">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How can Mary, the charmless Bennet sister in Pride and Prejudice, become a heroine? Author Janice Hadlow on the novelist as makeover artist</p><p>Poor Mary Bennet. It’s hard not to feel her creator didn’t like her very much. Jane Austen described <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> as “light, bright and sparkling”; but she didn’t bestow any of these qualities on the unfortunate middle Bennet daughter. Unlike her sisters, Mary possesses neither looks, wit or charm. Her hard won “accomplishments” have only made her pompous and priggish. In a book in which even the characters we aren’t supposed to admire fizz and pop with energy – step forward Lydia Bennet – only Mary fails to shine.</p><p>So why choose her as the subject for a novel? On one level, I simply felt sorry for her. I’d been a bookish young woman myself, with all the usual misgivings about how I appeared to the world. I would have loved to be her elder sister Elizabeth – handsome, assured and funny. But in truth, I suspected there was more than a little of Mary about me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/04/from-mary-bennet-to-thomas-cromwell-how-novelists-make-us-love-unlikeable-characters">Continue reading...</a>

Among those Iranian soldiers who survived was Qassem Suleimani.</p><p>The war, by all accounts, was a formative experience for the man who would later rise to a dominant position in Iran’s military, security and intelligence establishment. Suleimani’s loyalty to Iran’s revolutionary regime, which seized power in 1979, was firmly established. His belief that an implacable America was his country’s foremost foe was written in blood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/04/after-suleimani-iran-will-hit-back-hard-simon-tisdall">Continue reading...</a>

These disguised celebs then have to sing before a panel of (also) celebrity detectives, who are tasked with divining the star behind the disguise.

However momentarily appealing the thought of never drinking (or eating?) again after December’s excess might be, the reality is much tougher. We need sustenance and substance in this long, cold month, not withdrawal and denial. So don’t give up wheat or gluten; instead, take up all the other flours out there, from chickpea to potato. And rather than defaulting to breadcrumbs for your fritters, look into using a different starch. Give up giving up, I say. Take up new things instead: new ingredients, flavours, techniques and recipes. Shake it up and see what lands. It is a new decade, after all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/04/new-years-resolution-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi-chickpea-pancakes-fish-fritters-berbere-ratatouille">Continue reading...</a>

The performances of Sophie Cookson, Ellie Bamber and Emilia Fox are the reason why even those of us who lived through the events now have something new to learn.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/04/profumo-scandal-trial-of-christine-keeler-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Switch to single sign-on system at one hospital alone saved 130 staffing hours a day</p><p>The NHS is to receive £40m in funding to try to cut login times on IT systems across the health service – a move the government says could free up thousands of staffing hours a day as the saved seconds add up.</p><p>In a typical hospital, staff need to log in to as many as 15 systems when tending to a patient. As well as taking up time, the proliferation of logins requires staff either to remember multiple complex passwords or, more likely, compromise security by reusing the same one on every system.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/04/nhs-gets-40m-to-cut-login-times-on-its-it-systems">Continue reading...</a>

## Suleimani killing the latest in a long, grim line of US assassination efforts

<p>There has been no shortage of US attempts to remove foreign adversaries through highly dubious legal or ethical means </p><p>The US government is no stranger to the dark arts of political assassinations. Over the decades it has deployed elaborate techniques against its foes, from dispatching a chemist armed with lethal poison to try to take out Congo’s Patrice Lumumba in the 1960s to planting <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/cuba/article181288881.html">poison pills</a> (equally unsuccessfully) in the Cuban leader Fidel Castro’s food.</p><p>But <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/visual-guide-airstrike-that-killed-qassam-suleimani-us-iran">the killing </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/03/visual-guide-airstrike-that-killed-qassam-suleimani-us-iran">of General Qassem Suleimani</a>, the leader of Iran’s elite military Quds Force, was in in a class all its own. Its uniqueness lay not so much in its method – what difference does it make to the victim if they are eviscerated by aerial drone like Suleimani, or executed following a CIA-backed coup, as was Iraq’s ruler in 1963, Abdul Karim Kassem? – but in the brazenness of its execution and the apparently total disregard for either legal niceties or human consequences.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/04/us-political-assassinations-history-iran-suleimani">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I dread getting calls in the middle of the night in case it is to tell me about another suicide by a K-drama actor or K-pop celebrity</p><p>On a hot August day in 2008, I was invited to appear on a TV entertainment programme hosted by actor Ahn Jae-hwan. I noticed Ahn was behaving oddly, walking nervously around the studio whenever he was off camera. He was running a business on the side, and it wasn’t doing well. He was inundated with complaints and had become the target of an online boycott and malicious comments.</p><p>I was very worried and mentioned my concern to an actress who was an old friend. “I am worried he might choose to end it all,” I told her. My actor friend said she knew his problems and that his friends and colleagues were trying to help him. Later that month Ahn took his own life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/04/i-have-reported-on-30-korean-celebrity-suicides-the-blame-game-never-changes">Continue reading...</a>
