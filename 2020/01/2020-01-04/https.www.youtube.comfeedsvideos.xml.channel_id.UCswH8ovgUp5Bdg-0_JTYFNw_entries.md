In this video explore what it means to think that you are in control of the universe only to find out that this belief of, I am personally in charge of the world leads, ultimately leads us to conflict and discomfort.
 
"The evidence is, I need help. Whenever I've got a problem, whenever I'm in pain, whenever I'm unhappy, I have to at least be open to the possibility that the reason for it is that I think I'm in control of the universe. It's often that, whether I'm sat in traffic ranting and raving or if I'm trying to control my personal relationships. Once I admit there's a problem, it's possible that the problem could change. I'm now ready for a bit of a kicker. That, and that is that it's not me that's going to bring about these new conditions." ~Russell Brand
