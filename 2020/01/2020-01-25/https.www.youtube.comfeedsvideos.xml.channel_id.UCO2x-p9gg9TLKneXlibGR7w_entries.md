*CORRECTIONS AND SUGGESTIONS*
1. I included the DSDT.aml file by accidentâ€”this is not needed
2. I included IntelMausiEthernet.kext. AMD systems only work with 211-AT - http://snazzy.fm/lth41
3. When editing your config.plist file, use the search function in ProperTree to ensure the following: (a) EC SSDT is set as "true," (b) Navi cards require the following boot arguments: [debug=0x100 agdpmod=pikera] (do not include brackets), (c) if you have a black screen after volume selection, make sure ProvideConsoleGOP is set to true.
4. Just about every other problem conceivable can be found here. Read/check it thoroughly.  http://snazzy.fm/d9RC8
