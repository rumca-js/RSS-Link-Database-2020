<p>Fulham’s manager has old-school values but understands the effects toxic social media can have on his players</p><p>“I used a psychologist when I was playing,” Scott Parker says. “It’s one of the most powerful things: how you can have a concrete head and not let things in. Of course there’s a technical element but nine times out of 10 when you’re having a bad day it will mainly be mental: the mistake you’ve made, the comment you’ve heard, the crowd’s reaction to a shot over the bar – after that the fear’s coming in.”</p><p>The mind fascinates Parker. Fulham’s manager wants to understand the human psyche. He aims to give his players resilience and the tools to think clearly under pressure. “You have your first 10 touches and kick it into the stand, there’s a technical element,” he says. “But what makes the 11th touch go in the stand again? It’s probably because the crowd are on me. You need to think: ‘Let me go back to basics and build.’ It starts in your head and taking a deep breath.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/25/scott-parker-fulham-old-school-values-social-media-fa-cup">Continue reading...</a>

After the tumult and division of recent times, we must guard against resigned complacency<p>Historians will debate the reasons for the complacency that descended on the British in the first months of the 2020s. Had their government duped the nation into ignorant passivity? Were they really as stupid as they appeared to be? Nothing had been settled. The pain was yet to come. Yet they behaved as if they believed Boris Johnson when he said he could “get Brexit done”. And, as I’m certain the historians of the future will say, believing Boris Johnson never ended well.</p><p>A few causes of our torpor appear obvious. The Conservatives won a handsome majority. Brexit bored the public rigid. The opposition was hopeless. Journalists weren’t doing their job.

She then became a solo artist, and a writer of three bestselling books: her 2013 memoir <em>Bedsit Disco Queen</em>, 2016’s <em>Naked </em><em>at </em><em>the Albert Hall</em> and <em>Another Planet</em>, published last year, which traces her years growing up in London’s suburbs, and is out in paperback on 6 February.</p><p><strong>How does writing about </strong><strong>the 1970s world of </strong><em><strong>Another Planet</strong></em><strong> </strong><strong>feel now?</strong><br />My own kids can’t imagine how we ever survived when I tell them about staying in all evening waiting for a phone call from someone, who you’d then arrange to meet under a clock tower in a nearby town, only to have the bus cancelled and not be able to get there. The thing that strikes me now is how locally rooted our lives were. Without the internet, we had no access to other people in other places, so we did a lot of dreaming and a lot of fantasising.

<p>The university’s expansive new library and dance centre, designed by Dublin’s Grafton Architects, invites students to engage with each other – and the neighbourhood</p><p>Architects love to talk about the public. They describe how their buildings will welcome people in, how their designs will engender shared life and understanding, how they will be permeable, accessible and vibrant, and they like devices by which the notion of public-ness is translated into architectural form. Brutalists used to call the elevated walkways of their housing projects “streets in the sky”. From the 1970s onwards, corporate architects tried to demonstrate their public spirit by putting glass-roofed “atria” in the heart of their developments. There’s currently a worldwide enthusiasm for an idea that has been around for a while, that of putting an arc or a bank of stepped seating in a place and calling it (not quite accurately) an “amphitheatre”.</p><p>None of this is surprising. Architects are mostly well-intentioned and optimistic people who want to do good in the world. To offer themselves as guardians of public life also gives them a role. Their professional status being nebulous, given that it’s possible to build a building without them, it helps if they can offer a better justification than: “This is what I like so suck it up.” Or: “This is what my reclusive, misanthropic offshore billionaire client likes so suck it up.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/25/town-house-kingston-university-grafton-architects-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The palliative care doctor on her moving new memoir, Boris Johnson’s broken promises, and why the way we treat dying people should be the number one metric of a civilised society</p><p>Dr Rachel Clarke worked as a television documentary-maker before deciding – as a GP’s daughter, this was always on the cards – to study medicine. She now specialises in palliative care, partly because it is centred on the patient rather than on any disease. It is impossible to overstate the qualities that make Clarke a first-rate doctor: sympathetic intelligence, kindness, a sense of humour. And she is one of those crucial people who will not settle for second best.</p><p>She champions her patients and turns a critical eye on the politicians failing the NHS. A regular <a href="https://twitter.com/doctor_oxford?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" title="">hell-raiser on Twitter</a>, she works at Katharine House, a hospice in Oxfordshire. Her first bestselling book, <em>Your Life in My Hands</em>, was about junior doctors (she got involved in the government dispute). Her new memoir, <em>Dear Life</em>, is about how the end of life can be best approached. It is an important, moving and unexpectedly uplifting book and doubles as a farewell to her father, whose death from cancer, in 2017, brought her professional life into new focus.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jan/25/doctor-rachel-clarke-dear-life-interview">Continue reading...</a>

## Quick, cheap to make and loved by police – facial recognition apps are on the rise | John Naughton

<p>Clearview AI may be controversial but it’s not the first business to identify you from your online pics</p><p>Way back in May 2011, Eric Schmidt, who was then the executive chairman of Google, said that the rapid development of facial recognition technology had been one of the things that had surprised him most in a long career as a computer scientist. But its “surprising accuracy” was “very concerning”. Questioned about this, he said that a database using facial recognition technology was unlikely to be a service that the company would create, but went on to say that “some company … is going to cross that line”.</p><p>As it happens, Dr Schmidt was being economical with the <em>actualité</em>, as the MP Alan Clark used to say. He must surely have known that a few months earlier Facebook had announced that it was using facial recognition in the US to suggest names while tagging photos. And some time after Schmidt spoke, Google itself launched a facial recognition feature in its own ill-fated social network, Google+. It was called Find My Face and it scanned photos from users and their friends to identify recognisable faces. Four years later, as the tech analyst Ben Thompson points out, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud released face-recognition APIs, followed by Amazon Web Services with its Rekognition service in 2016. So it turns out that lots of companies – including Schmidt’s own – had crossed the facial recognition red line.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/jan/25/facial-recognition-apps-are-on-the-rise">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether at work or at home, success depends on how good a listener you are</p><p>When people find out I’m a journalist, they typically tell me they used to write for their school newspaper or that their child wants to be a journalist, or that their cousin is a blogger. Or they might say they loved a film about a newsroom, but can’t remember the name. They might try to look up the film on their phones and, while they are at it, will show me a cat video trending on Twitter.</p><p>It’s rare that people don’t interrupt and shift conversation to themselves. Bad listeners are not necessarily bad or boorish people. You’re likely to have a dear friend, family member, or maybe a romantic partner who is a bad listener. Perhaps you, yourself, are not the best listener. And you could be forgiven. In many ways, we have been conditioned not to listen.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/25/its-time-to-tune-in-why-listening-is-the-real-key-to-communication">Continue reading...</a>

His new book, <a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/future-is-faster-than-you-think" title=""><em>The Future Is Faster Than You Think</em></a>, argues that the already rapid pace of technological innovation is about to get a whole lot quicker.</p><p><strong>Do you think people are worried about where technology is going to take us?</strong><br />I can palpably feel how fast things are changing and that the rate of change is accelerating, and I have picked up a growing amount of fear coming from people who don’t understand where the world is going. And that is not good when you’re trying to solve problems. This book is about giving people a roadmap for where things are going over the next decade so they have less fear and more anticipation. Because, yes, in the next 10 years, we’re going to reinvent every industry on this planet, but the change is one that is for the benefit of masses, whether it’s in longevity or food or banking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/25/peter-diamandis-future-faster-think-interview-ai-industry">Continue reading...</a>

But after publication of the first volume of the book, covering the March sisters’ childhood, Alcott was flooded with letters from fans demanding to know whom the little women had married.

## From fig leaves to pinups: Mary Beard on the evolution of the nude

<p>The male gaze has shaped art’s obsession with the naked body. Mary Beard offers a female perspective</p><p>Mary Beard is standing on a chair, chiselling the fig leaf off a large classical statue in Crawford Art Gallery in Cork. “God this is quite exciting. My hand is taut with the nerves of it all,” she says, though what lies beneath the familiar modesty motif turns out to be something of a disappointment. The statue, cast in plaster from an original in the Vatican collection, has suffered “a limited castration”, with the result that the fig leaf – probably added in the 19th century to spare the blushes of Irish art lovers – had nothing much to hide. “There’s something really ironic about these things that were meant to stop you seeing things,” Beard reflects, “when what they end up doing is saying: ‘Look at what you can’t see.’” </p><p>Her outing to Cork comes midway through the first episode of <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/mediapacks/visualarts/bbctwo#heading-mary-beards-shock-of-the-nude-wt-2-x-60" title="">Shock of the Nude</a></em>, a two-part BBC Two series which sets out to interrogate western art’s obsession with the naked body. The Cambridge classics professor has already marvelled at the marble musculature of Michelangelo’s <em>David</em> and tried her hand at a life-drawing hen party (“He’s got very good bum cheeks,” enthuses one of the group). These scenes are a subversion of Beard’s central thesis: “I don’t think you can talk about the nude unless you talk about male desire.” Given the dominance of the male gaze, the programmes ask, how is a woman to find her own perspective?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/25/mary-beard-nude-art-male-gaze-naked-desire-female-perspective">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From stars who don’t age to the Love Island pout, the ‘tweaked’ look is becoming the new normal. But what is it doing to us?</p><p>Do you know what a tweakment is?<strong> </strong>I didn’t, not really, until I was lying on my back with a woman dressed in white poised to inject a needle into my face. Tweakment sounds cute, right? Well, tweak does. Like in the Mary Poppins song: “My father gave me nose a tweak.” A tweak is a gesture of affection, like pinching the cheek of a toddler. Tweak tweak.</p><p>A tweakment is a minor cosmetic procedure, one that doesn’t involve being cut open or going under general anaesthetic or hiding from the world for a fortnight. (Actually, it might involve the last.) The word has come to prominence over the past few years, and is used to cover many different techniques and therapies, mostly done to your face.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/25/rather-spend-300-fillers-rise-tweakment-face">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Clear clutter, change who does the washing up, and put worrying to one side, say the experts</p><p>There’s a tendency to focus on the big things coming in the year ahead (a child starting school, a teenager heading to university, a son or daughter getting married) and start worrying. “Make a list of what’s going to happen, then put it in a drawer and forget about it,” says Samantha Abraham, a life coach with 20 years’ experience working with families. “It’s much better to tackle family life a month, or even a week, at a time. Change is going to happen, and it’s often easier to cope with in the moment. You won’t make it easier by worrying.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/25/how-to-reboot-family-life-phone-bans-rainy-day-fund">Continue reading...</a>

There are also fears that the huge number of feral horses that remain are pushing bushfire-affected threatened species closer to extinction. 'The horses are destroying the refuges of the endangered plants and animals in the mountains', says Prof Jamie Pittock from the Australian National University.
