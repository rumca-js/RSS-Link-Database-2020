But its \u201csurprising accuracy\u201d was \u201cvery concerning\u201d. Questioned about this, he said that a database using facial recognition technology was unlikely to be a service that the company would create, but went on to say that \u201csome company \u2026 is going to cross that line\u201d.</p><p>As it happens, Dr Schmidt was being economical with the <em>actualit\u00e9</em>, as the MP Alan Clark used to say. He must surely have known that a few months earlier Facebook had announced that it was using facial recognition in the US to suggest names while tagging photos. And some time after Schmidt spoke, Google itself launched a facial recognition feature in its own ill-fated social network, Google+. It was called Find My Face and it scanned photos from users and their friends to identify recognisable faces. Four years later, as the tech analyst Ben Thompson points out, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud released face-recognition APIs, followed by Amazon Web Services with its Rekognition service in 2016. So it turns out that lots of companies \u2013 including Schmidt\u2019s own \u2013 had crossed the facial recognition red line.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/jan/25/facial-recognition-apps-are-on-the-rise\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/commentisfree/2020/jan/25/facial-recognition-apps-are-on-the-rise", "date_published": "2020-01-25 16:00:01+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "BP looks to charismatic oil man to lead response to climate crisis", "description": "Bernard Looney is hailed as a moderniser but made his name at the company pumping crude<p>It has been almost 10 years since BP was mired in the largest marine oil spill in history, following the explosion at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jun/05/bp-deepwater-horizon-spill-report-failures-risks\" title=\"\">Deepwater Horizon</a> rig in the Gulf of Mexico.
