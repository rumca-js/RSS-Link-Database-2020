Whenever I've got a problem, whenever I'm in pain, whenever I'm unhappy, I have to at least be open to the possibility that the reason for it is that I think I'm in control of the universe. It's often that, whether I'm sat in traffic ranting and raving or if I'm trying to control my personal relationships. Once I admit there's a problem, it's possible that the problem could change. I'm now ready for a bit of a kicker. That, and that is that it's not me that's going to bring about these new conditions.\" ~Russell Brand\n \nMy 12-day course on recovery will be available for FREE this January if you sign up here: https://www.onecommune.com/a/20323/cGftrerE\n \nSubscribe to my channel here: http://tinyurl.com/opragcg\n(make sure to hit the BELL icon to be notified of new videos!)\n\nListen to my Under The Skin podcast here: \nhttp://luminary.link/russell\n\nGet my book \"Recovery\" here: https://amzn.to/2R7c810\nGet my book \"Mentors\" here (and as an audiobook!): https://amzn.to/2t0Zu9U\n\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/russellbrand/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/rustyrockets", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RM3UcL4K_E", "date_published": "2020-01-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
