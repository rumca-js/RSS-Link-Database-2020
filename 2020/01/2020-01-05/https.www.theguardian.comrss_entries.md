<p>• Eighteen-year-old hits stunning goal from outside the box<br />• Jürgen Klopp hails ‘very confident, unbelievable’ player</p><p>Curtis Jones said his stunning winner for Liverpool against Everton at Anfield in the FA Cup was beyond his wildest dreams as Jürgen Klopp savoured the triumph of a line-up packed with inexperienced players. Jones struck with a curler into the top corner from outside the area in the 71st minute to give Liverpool a 1-0 win – it was the 18-year-old’s first senior goal – and he admitted that it was overwhelming.</p><p>“I dream of a lot of things but this one was ahead of a dream,” Jones said. “I can’t sum up my emotions. There are world-class players all over this team but I think I went out and showed what I could do. The ball came to me and I only had one thing in mind – to shoot. It’s massive for me and the rest of the young boys. At times it’s frustrating thinking you might get a chance but then having to sit on the bench and watch.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/05/liverpool-curtis-jones-winner-everton-fa-cup-jurgen-klopp">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Where were the Bond antics? Where was Lenny Henry? And where was the plot?! What a disappointing, befuddling second outing<br /></p><p>“Previously on Doctor Who” is usually the most comforting of phrases. And yet Spyfall part two collapsed under the weight of its own bombast mere moments after those words were uttered. I complained last series about the seemingly pedestrian nature of this new Doctor Who compared with the more bonkers moments of Steven Moffat’s pomp. Now, that feels like a case of careful what you wish for. Sure, the second instalment of Spyfall was a riot, but riots are supposed to at least be explicable. There was little of that on display here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/05/doctor-who-recap-series-38-episode-two-spyfall-part-two">Continue reading...</a>

Distraction from almost everything but those bushfires. Repeated checks of the emergency services website maps to see whether the growing boundaries of fire-affected areas of south-east Australia – home – have edged closer to the last-known locations or properties of family and friends. Anxious phone calls and messaging at night, UK time. Efforts to imagine what colleagues on conference calls from Sydney mean when they say they are so, so sick of the smoke.</p><p>Walking to and from work on rainy pavements, in coat and scarf against the chill, attempting to itemise memories of bushfires past, in obedience to a solidarity impulse heightened by distance. Recalling the young reporter in the light plane with a door off to permit the photographer better images of the fire below, its hot breath shooting the plane up fast and flat, as if on strings, whenever the pilot went too low and close. Interviewing people in the ash and ruin of homes lost a fierce few hours just prior – they would talk as though they were rebuilding through the very act of speaking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/05/cold-streets-haunted-australia-bushfires">Continue reading...</a>

This country will not profit from pursuing a reckless Brexit while hitching ourselves to Donald Trump’s Iranian misadventure<p>A British prime minister <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-402194/Blair-flies-home-turmoil.html" title="">flies back</a> from a Caribbean holiday where he has been, courtesy of millionaire friends, sunning himself on yachts while the Middle East is in flames and Britain in the grip of a security crisis. Britain’s key ally is accused of war crimes on foreign soil in a fight with Iran and its regional proxies. European opinion has quickly solidified around the idea that both sides show restraint. The British response is to defy this advice and endorse a belligerent US administration’s approach. Deja vu?

## 'Even dust can be interesting': the woman who photographs housework

<p>Clare Gallagher works full-time then comes home to the ‘mind-numbing’ toil of laundry, dishes, cooking and cleaning. So what happened when she started photographing it all?</p><p>‘I hate housework!” the American comedian Joan Rivers quipped. “You make the beds, you do the dishes and six months later you have to start all over again.” In her intriguing photobook, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/dec/17/top-15-photography-books-of-2019">The Second Shift</a>, Clare Gallagher places that quote next to an altogether more serious one by the French writer and philosopher Simone de Beauvoir, who famously compared the repetitive grind of housework to “the torture of Sisyphus”.</p><p>Several years in the making and self-published in a limited edition of 500, The Second Shift is an artist’s book that, despite its apparently mundane subject matter, often approaches the sublime. Gallagher captures the familiar workload of family life (piles of laundry, baskets of unironed clothes) as well as the constant creeping chaos that attends it (dirty dishes, food scraps, sinks blocked with slimy domestic detritus). </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/05/even-dust-can-be-interesting-clare-gallagher-photographs-housework">Continue reading...</a>

## How to colour your hair – without damaging it

<p>If you’re thinking about a new look, follow these expert tips to avoid a disaster. And never, ever do a DIY bleach job</p><p>The first thing to consider when you’re colouring your hair is your lifestyle: are you high or low maintenance? Consider your makeup routine and clothing. Going any type of blonde if you’re a natural brunette is high maintenance. If you go to the salon say every three to six months, then do something that will have an easy grow out, such as highlights or lighter ends. If you have 40% or less grey then try a semi-permanent dye. It fades away and then you can retouch as you wish.</p><p>Don’t highlight your whole head. When you study, you don’t highlight the whole book. If you have curly hair, have a slightly thicker highlight, so it is powerful enough to see but not chunky. Most people look better with warm tones such as honey, caramel and toffee, which are more neutral. Usually ash tones are dull so don’t really work with many skin tones.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jan/05/how-to-colour-your-hair-without-damaging-it">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A third of adults cuddle up to teddies every night for emotional comfort – and research shows there are real health benefits</p><p>If you share your bed with a furry friend well into adulthood, don’t be ashamed – sleeping with soft toys is more normal than you might think. “It’s very common,” says Prof Bruce Hood of the University of Bristol, who has researched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/dec/12/still-have-childhood-teddy-psychological-power-toys-we-keep">our attachment to childhood toys</a>. He tells me that about one in three of the people he has questioned still sleep with teddies, and that it is probably more common for women, as it is more socially acceptable for them to do so.</p><p>Why are we hanging on to our cuddly toys? “My hunch is that it’s to do with sleeping practices,” Hood says. In western cultures, we tend to separate children from their parents after the first year – after which they sleep on their own, and self-soothe using blankets and soft toys. “These become part of the sleep ritual.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jan/05/bears-lifeline-adults-who-sleep-with-soft-toys">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Boris Johnson’s adviser wants more maths geniuses in the civil service. But real life is too messy to be boiled down to equations</p><p>About 10 years ago I had a conversation with a civil servant about Britain’s chemical decontamination units. He was in charge of calculating where in the country the government should keep them. These giant trucks had specialist equipment that could respond quickly if there was an anthrax attack or similar on our shores. But at the time there was only a small number of them, so they needed careful positioning to ensure they could reach as much of the country as quickly as possible in an emergency.</p><p>It’s a decision that boils down to maths. It’s not an easy thing to work out either. It was a problem that I, as a mathematician, imagined had a number of top minds working to solve. Picture my astonishment, then, when I discovered that rather than some beautifully crafted numerical model, or some sophisticated custom-built software, the British government had left a question of such magnitude to one poor guy, working it out on his own. He was using an Excel spreadsheet. And we were having the conversation because his spreadsheet kept crashing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/05/cummings-whitehall-weirdos-boris-johnson-maths-civil-service">Continue reading...</a>

With the government’s plans – from immigration to counter-extremism – pandering to prejudice, Muslims will be unsafe<p>Boris Johnson is one of the most openly racist and Islamophobic politicians in recent British history.

2020 will see Sony’s PlayStation 5 pitched against Microsoft’s Xbox Series X with next-generation revamps and some slick new franchises<p>The video game industry has always worked to a lurching rhythm. Every few years the PlayStation 3 evolves, with seamless inevitability, into the PlayStation 4, and so on, each numerical tick of the counter promising fertile turf from which previously inconceivable video game miracles will sprout. This year will mark the next round of the so-called console wars, as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/nov/21/playstation-5-the-11-games-console-release-god-of-war-2-grand-theft-auto-6" title="">Sony’s PlayStation 5</a> competes with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2019/dec/13/microsoft-names-its-new-games-console-xbox-series-x" title="">Microsoft’s Xbox Series X</a> (destined to be confused by bewildered grandparents with the current Xbox One X). Like Blur v Oasis, or <em>Star Wars</em> v <em>Star Trek</em>, the true beneficiaries of this kind of tribalistic framing of capitalist enterprise will, surely, be the companies behind the products. As in the past, the rival machines will likely be equivalently powerful and share many of the same games.</p><p>In an attempt to lure consumers toward their product, Microsoft has pinned its hopes on the closest thing the company has to an exclusive mascot: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/12/halo-master-chief-collection-review" title="">Master Chief</a>. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/halo-infinite" title=""><em>Halo Infinite</em></a> hopes to do for the Xbox Series X what Halo did for the original Xbox in the distant technological plains of 2001. That the ageing space marine might convince the zoomer generation to glance away from <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home" title=""><em>Fortnite</em></a> long enough to marvel at the high-definition sheen of his extremely 2000s-era space armour is perhaps doubtful.

Together with a half marathon, 10K and 5K, the races host around 5,000 runners from across the world. Taking part in the non-profit event means helping the local community, with the 2019 edition raising funds for local charities, in particular those tackling homelessness in the city.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jan/05/running-the-kingston-marathon-jamaica-holidays">Continue reading...</a>

## Ncuti Gatwa: ‘I’ll say yes to anything’

<p>The breakout star of the cult TV series Sex Education talks about his Rwandan roots, family gossip and coping with overnight success</p><p>At the beginning of 2019, Ncuti Gatwa had fewer than 1,000 followers on Instagram. He had filmed <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jan/17/sex-education-asa-butterfield-gillian-anderson-netflix" title="">Sex Education</a></em> the previous summer, and by January, it was ready for the world to see. Though it starred big names – Gillian Anderson, Asa Butterfield – on paper the show sounded more like a cult oddity than a smash hit. Butterfield played Otis, a secondary-school student turned sex therapist for his peers in a gaudy world that sat between a John Hughes movie and a <em>Just </em><em>Seventeen </em>problem page. Gatwa starred as Eric Effiong, Otis’s best friend. Netflix had flown the cast to New York to promote <em>Sex Education</em>, which was released when Gatwa was on the return flight – and his character was a huge hit. When he landed at Heathrow, Gatwa turned on his phone. In the space of several hours, his follower count had gone up… by a couple of hundred thousand.</p><p>“It definitely felt <em>exposing</em>,” Gatwa says. He’s sitting in a café in Soho, almost exactly a year after the show changed his life so suddenly. At 27, he is a decade older than Eric, and less flamboyant, though he shares the character’s ebullience. He sounds different, too – his own accent roams Scotland, Rwanda and Tottenham, where he now lives, and his broad laugh ripples across the busy lunchtime crowd.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jan/05/ncuti-gatwa-i-will-say-yes-to-anything-sex-education">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In 1945, hundreds of children liberated from concentration camps were flown into a tiny town in the Lake District to begin new lives. On the eve of a BBC dramatisation of their story, 91-year-old survivor Arek Hersh talks about the experience</p><p>On the morning of 14 August 1945 towards the end of the second world war, 16-year-old Arek Hersh and 300 other Jewish children boarded a squadron of 10 converted Stirling bombers and took off from Prague. They were organised in groups of 30 to each aeroplane, with 15 sitting on each side on the floor. Hersh remembers it vividly: “They cut us some bread,” he says. “We thought it was cake. They gave us each a piece and it was great.” About eight hours later, they landed at RAF Crosby-on-Eden, near Carlisle.</p><p>The children were the first intake of a pioneering rehabilitation scheme, in which boys and girls from labour and concentration camps in eastern Europe were transported to the Lake District to find new families and start afresh. Their journey has been dramatised by the screenwriter Simon Block and the result is a timely and moving BBC film <em>The Windermere Children</em>, starring Thomas Kretschmann and Romola Garai, to be shown this month, 75 years after the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/05/windermere-children-arek-hersh-survivor-bbc-drama">Continue reading...</a>

## After the fall: can Alexander Zverev bounce back to tennis stardom?

<p>He had it all: talent, good looks and a chance to be the world No 1. But then Alexander Zverev’s life went to pieces…</p><p>The tennis player Alexander Zverev has blue eyes and shaggy blond hair and is 6ft 7in tall. His legs are stilts, and his face, journalists have pointed out, is that of an Abercrombie &amp; Fitch model. Zverev actually has a modelling contract with Zegna, the Italian fashion brand, partly because he is a well-known tennis player, but also because he looks less like a tennis player and more like a luxury clothes horse.</p><p>Zverev is 22. He joined the pro circuit in 2013, when he was 16. At the end of 2018, he was ranked the fourth best men’s tennis player in the world, behind Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer – the big three – but ahead of younger challengers. He’d recently won the ATP Finals, in London, the so-called fifth grand slam, becoming the youngest player to win the tournament in a decade. As a kid he’d been the world junior No 1 and a junior grand slam champion. For years, fans had thought of him as tennis’s crown prince – the prodigal heir. Both Nadal and Djokovic had hinted at Zverev becoming their eventual successor. Here, <em>finally</em>, after the failed attempts of other once up-and-coming players, was a talent poised to dethrone the game’s elder greats. At the end of one 2018 tournament, Boris Becker announced: “A star has arrived.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/05/after-the-fall-can-alexander-zverev-bounce-back-to-tennis-stardom">Continue reading...</a>

## Jojo Rabbit review – down the rabbit hole with Hitler

<p>Taika Waititi follows a distinguished tradition with this ‘strange art comedy’ about a boy growing up in Nazi Germany, but fails to cut to the dark heart of the matter</p><p>Since the days of Chaplin’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/18/chaplin-great-dictator-comedy" title=""><em>The Great Dictator</em></a>, film-makers have adopted naive or comedic perspectives to pierce and deflate the hideous bubble of Nazi ideology – a risky strategy that can reap rich rewards. In the 1967 classic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/01/the-producers-review-mel-brooks-comedy-gene-wilder" title=""><em>The Producers</em></a>, Mel Brooks made comedy gold from the spectre of a terrible play celebrating Hitler’s little-known dance skills. The film won a best screenplay Oscar and spawned a hit stage musical that in turn produced another star-studded screen adaptation. In 1999, Roberto Benigni’s “comedy drama” <em>Life </em><em>Is Beautiful</em> won three Oscars with its depiction of a man whose comic clowning keeps the horrors of a concentration camp from his son – a premise weirdly reminiscent of Jerry Lewis’s ill-judged <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/10/lost-jerry-lewis-holocaust-movie-acquired-library" title=""><em>The Day </em><em>the Clown Cried</em></a>, which was effectively banned by its creator, becoming the subject of ignominious legend.</p><p>Now, in this Golden Globe-nominated adaptation of Christine Leunens’s book <a href="https://www.johnmurraypress.co.uk/titles/christine-leunens/caging-skies/9781529396362/" title=""><em>Caging Skies</em></a>, New Zealand writer-director-performer Taika Waititi plays a camp, slapstick version of Hitler, who exists in the mind of a German boy, Jojo. Roman Griffin Davis plays the 10-year-old growing up under the Third Reich, whose jolly dreams of becoming an Aryan war hero are thwarted by his innate sensitivity and squeamishness. Nicknamed Jojo Rabbit after failing to strangle a bunny when ordered to do so at a Nazi youth training camp, our antihero promptly blows himself up with a hand grenade, rendering him unfit for future combat. Instead, he’s assigned more menial tasks, including handing out recruitment leaflets, spurred on by visions of his imaginary Führer friend.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/05/jojo-rabbit-review-taika-waititi-hitler-scarlett-johansson-sam-rockwell">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The RSPCA consultant, honoured with an MBE for racehorse welfare, predicts an end to the use of the whip</p><p>New Year’s Eve brought the end of an era as David Muir, who has spent 21 years as racing consultant to the RSPCA, completed his final shift by overseeing the action at Haydock, his avuncular appearance as ever disguising the sharpness of his perception. The news had just broken that he was to be honoured by the Queen with a well-earned MBE for services to racehorse welfare.</p><p>Muir has had<strong> </strong>a difficult task and he has handled it with such skill that attention has hardly ever been called to his presence, somewhere between the sport and the charity. For decades he has sustained dialogue between two groups inclined to be suspicious of each other, knowing there are individuals on either side who would rather have nothing to do with those opposite.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/05/david-muir-racehorse-welfare">Continue reading...</a>

The German photographer’s drone reveals the otherworldly colours of a salt-processing area in southern France<p>Ever since you could take a camera up in a hot-air balloon, there has been a fascination with photographing the Earth from the air. The evolution of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2017/jan/25/worlds-best-drone-photography-skypixel-competition" title="">drone technology allows new ways of seeing</a>, not possible even from the most manoeuvrable helicopter. The German photographer Tom Hegen has been a pioneer of such opportunities. Shooting directly downwards from a hovering near-stationary drone, he can flatten out perspective to the point that the Earth’s surface seems like a stretched canvas. His images of salt production landscapes in southern Europe give the sense that Google Earth has been hacked by abstract expressionist painters.</p><p>This picture was taken above the pink lakes and white mountains of the salt industry at Aigues-Mortes near Montpellier in the south of France. Salt has been processed continuously from the marshes here since Roman times. To create table salt, seawater is channelled through 45 miles (70km) of intricate canals or <em>roubines</em>. The area is now restricted to visitors because of its unique ecosystem.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/05/big-picture-tom-hegens-alluring-abstract-salt-landscape-aerial-photograph">Continue reading...</a>
