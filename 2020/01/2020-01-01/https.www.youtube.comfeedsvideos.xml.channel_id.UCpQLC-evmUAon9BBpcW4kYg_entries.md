THE TURNING POINT Song Lyrics

My heart is free
My heart is free
No place where I would rather be

My heart is free
My heart is free
Until you come to rescue me

You find me here
You find me here
You dry my eyes and shed a tear
You turn me bad
You turn me good
Forget to hope and learn to fear

CHORUS

Tell me that its good
If we do something
Believe in something
I don't think I should
If it aint nothing
If it aint nothing good

My heart is free
My heart is free
No place where I would rather be 
You find me here
You find me here
You dry my eyes and shed a tear


CHORUS
