<p>Arsenal’s 2-0 win over Manchester United shows manager may already have discovered how to make the most of £72m man</p><p>Welcome to the Emirates, Nicolas Pépé. We’ve been expecting you. On a chilly, boisterous night in north London, Arsenal’s £72m record signing produced a fine attacking performance that was startling in more ways than one.</p><p>Startling first of all because Pépé was able to unpick the left side of Manchester United’s defence with such ease that the heavy-legged, heavy-footed, and indeed heavy Luke Shaw looked genuinely lost at times, a single stone Easter Island head planted in the sand, watching on in sombre silence as a game of football took place around him.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/01/mikel-arteta-nicolas-pepe-arsenal-manchester-united">Continue reading...</a>

• Scot denies his world No 1 opponent 7-3 in final<br />• Underdog won three successive sets in title charge<p>Perhaps we should have believed Peter Wright when he told us that this time things would be different. Perhaps, knowing what we do now, we should have paid a little more attention when he told us on the eve of his first world title that his darts finally felt comfortable in his hand, that his game finally felt in working order, and that he finally felt ready to rule.</p><p>The trouble was that to do so would have been to fight the overwhelming tide of logic. For one thing, Wright turns 50 in March, an unlikely sort of age to launch a grasp for greatness. A record of 10 defeats in 11 major finals hinted strongly at his ultimate level: a contender, not a conqueror. Seven of those defeats had come against Michael van Gerwen, the triple world champion, one of the greatest players in history, and his opponent here. This was the logic that Wright calmly and courageously ripped to pieces at Alexandra Palace on Wednesday.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/01/peter-wright-beats-michael-van-gerwen-pdc-world-championship-final">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There can be no quick fixes. The party needs to take time for judgments to settle about its descent into the electoral abyss</p><p>Nearly a month ago Jeremy Corbyn announced he would step down after a period of reflection. This week he offered the first fruits of that process: 2019, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2019/dec/31/its-been-quite-the-year-for-labour-jeremy-corbyns-new-year-message-video" title="">Corbyn announced</a>, had been “quite the year for our country and our labour movement”. Nevertheless, he added: “We have built a movement. We are the resistance to Boris Johnson.”</p><p>It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry. But Labour is unquestionably going to have to do very much better than this if it is to climb out of the electoral abyss into which Corbyn led it in December. Talking about resistance to Johnson is simply displacement activity. The central truth is that Labour has to make itself the electable alternative that it failed to be in 2019. It needs to have a strategy for power. In the real world, power is hope, not the other way round.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/01/questions-labour-win-party-defeat">Continue reading...</a>

Steve Jobs once said about work that it was our life’s mission to “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jan/20/do-what-you-love-good-or-bad-advice" title="">do what you love</a>”, but for most of us it is the compromise of “finding what you can put up with”. So, if most of us are never exactly going to love work, what can we do to make it a little less awful?</p><p>For starters, let’s be honest about what work is like. According to the magazine Management Today, the average Briton spends 16 hours a week in meetings, hostage to the drone of people they vaguely recognise. This is why most of us have learned that to survive in the modern workplace we need to master the “I’m not listening, but want you to think I am” nod, along with the subtle art of checking WhatsApp under a notebook.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jan/01/can-you-learn-to-love-the-job-you-have">Continue reading...</a>
