You should be able to make life more manageable, no matter how far or deep you are in your pain or addiction. You are constantly confronted by your fears of change, of self doubt, of yourself! 
 
The journey of recovery, especially in Step 2,  is where you remember and recognize that you are going somewhere, that there is a better version of you!
