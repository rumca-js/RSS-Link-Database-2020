<p>There’s no sign of Take a Letter Or Take a Chance yet, but this is a proper teatime treat that perfectly recreates the spirit of the original. And is there gunge? Of course there is!</p><p>Oh, such a lovely word was Crackerjack! But can it be again? This is the question on all our lips – or at least the lips of those who came of age at any point during the show’s original 29-year run (1955-1984) – as the new series gets under way.</p><p>Replacing the traditional single host – Eamonn Andrews/Leslie Crowther/Michael Aspel/Ed Stewart/Stu “Ooh, I could crush a grape!” Francis (delete according to era) – are Mark Rhodes and Sam Nixon. The pair have carved out successful presenting careers together after coming second and third in Pop Idol in 2003. By the end of the first episode – broadcast, as the rest will be, at teatime on Fridays – it is clear that appointing a duo is a smart move. They banter and riff off each other, and still have plenty of attention to spare for the contestants. Plus, they work beautifully together: warmhearted and lively, never playing things for adult laughs and pitching their jokes and teasing of the competing children perfectly. They appear, as claimed at the top of the show, to be having more fun than a toad in a toga doing loads of yoga. The eight-year-old next to me and the one who, against all odds, seems to have survived somewhere inside me, laughed like drains.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jan/17/crackerjack-review-superbly-silly-revival-brings-magic-back-to-kids-tv">Continue reading...</a>

Ollie Pope, after his performance during <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/17/south-africa-england-third-test-day-two-report-cricket" title="">this third Test against South Africa</a>, can undoubtedly be classed among that rare group.</p><p>It was not just that Pope, at 22 years and 15 days, became the youngest Englishman to score a Test century since Alastair Cook back in 2006 at Nagpur. It was everything about his innings, from the composure shown to get through a tricky period during the final session of day one, to the ability to grind through 26 balls in the 80s after the dismissals of Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler on the second afternoon, then the chutzpah to go into T20 mode once he had reached three figures and England were eyeing a declaration.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/17/ollie-popes-assured-innings-hints-at-bright-future-in-england-midle-order">Continue reading...</a>

## The Guardian view on ‘flight shaming’: face it – life must change | Editorial

Individual choices will not solve the climate crisis but ministers should not be encouraging flying<br /><p>It started in Sweden, where the term <em>flygskam</em> (flight shame) was coined in 2018 to describe the unease about flying experienced by environmentally conscious travellers. The hashtag <em>#jagstannarpåmarken</em> (which translates as #stayontheground) came into use around the same time, as groups sprang up to share tips.</p><p>Other wealthy countries are not immune from such trends: <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49890057" title="">a recent survey</a> of 6,000 people in Germany, France, the UK and the US found 21% had cut back. Such a shift in attitudes makes it all the more disturbing that members of the current government, including the health secretary, Matt Hancock, have yet to catch up. Asked twice on the radio this week whether people should reduce the number of flights they take, the minister said they should not.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/17/the-guardian-view-on-flight-shaming-face-it-life-must-change">Continue reading...</a>

The Portuguese super-agent is busy closing deals this month, but is he starting to wield too much influence in football?<p>When Jorge Mendes got married a few years back a story emerged that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33756401" title="">Cristiano Ronaldo had given football’s most potent agent a Greek island as a wedding present</a>.</p><p>It is hard to know the real truth of this. But it seems fitting, given Mendes’s deep-state mystique, that the legend of Ronaldo island has been recycled admiringly ever since, gaining resonance, layers, compound interest. Either way it seems likely Mendes would have enjoyed his Greek island in the expected style: loaning it to Lazio for five years, setting up a complex series of loans for its outlying archipelago, then selling it on to Turkey for six times the original price.

Matilda has since become one of the longest-running musicals in the West End.</p><p>According to the advertisement, the movie – produced by Working Title Films – will be shot from August to December.

## Talking Horses: fatality rate shows worrying Flat and jumps imbalance

<p>A horse racing over jumps in Britain in 2019 was around seven times more likely to suffer a fatal injury than one on the Flat</p><p>At first sight, the figures for fatal injuries to horses while racing in 2019, which were published on the British Horseracing Authority’s website on Friday, offer sound reasons for hope that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2019/jan/29/talking-horses-bha-seeks-industry-help-as-fatality-rate-rises-horse-racing-tips">the 2018 figure</a> – the highest for six years – was a blip in the overall trend that has seen the fatality rate in British racing drop by a third over the last 20 years. There were 91,937 starts in 2019, and 173 horses suffered fatal injuries, a rate of 0.19%, or 1.9 per 1,000 starts. The previous year saw 201 fatalities from 93,004 starts, an overall rate of 0.22%.</p><p>A closer look, however, is more worrisome, not least with the memory of 2018’s Parliamentary debate on racehorse protection, during which one MP asked “when will the target be zero?”, still quite fresh in the mind. This is because the overall figure includes both Flat and jumps racing, and while it remains extremely low, what was already a marked imbalance between Flat racing and the jumps is, if anything, increasing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/17/talking-horses-drop-in-fatality-rate-is-disputed-by-animal-rights-body">Continue reading...</a>

The Earth may be burning, but have no fear – Elon Musk assures us there will be plenty of jobs on Mars<p>When humanity’s dying stragglers mark up the final tapes for the time capsule, I hope they’ll call this episode A Great Week to Bail Out an Airline. Even as David Attenborough <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51123638" title="">warned of Earth’s “crisis moment”</a>, the UK government <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jan/14/flybe-saved-after-successful-last-ditch-talks" title="">rescued ailing airline Flybe</a> on the basis that some people can’t get to work between Wales and Scotland or wherever any other way. Eventually, surviving businessmen will be able to row between mountain peaks, but for now corporate efficiency trumped the climate emergency. Or the “climate debate”, as some still have it, even though it’s the sort of debate that should ideally ensue when I tell my children not to run in the road – ie, none.</p><p>And so to the global backdrop. The Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, must be religious, on the basis he’s offered “thoughts and prayers” to the victims of Australia’s raging bushfires. In any reasonable theology, however, Morrison’s decision to serve in a cabinet that abolished the country’s <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/politics/federal/abbott-shuts-down-climate-commission-20130919-2u185.html" title="">climate commission</a>, to slash fire and rescue budgets, and to ignore repeated <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/former-australian-fire-chiefs-say-coalition-doesnt-like-talking-about-climate-change" title="">concerns of fire chiefs</a> would suggest he’s going to burn in hell.

<p><strong>Sprüth</strong><strong> Magers, London<br /></strong>The duo’s video shot from a robot burrowing through the pipes beneath Zurich is reminiscent of birth, or a colonoscopy</p><p>The high point or, more accurately, the low point of this small exhibition of Swiss artists <a href="http://spruethmagers.com/artists/peter_fischli_david_weiss@@overview">Peter Fischli and David Weiss at Sprüth Magers</a>, is in the London gallery’s basement. Kanalvideo journeys through the sewers beneath the streets of Zurich, the camera mounted on a robotic vehicle that inspects the tunnels for blockages and leaks. The video is a full hour’s slow and silent burrowing along the cylindrical pipes. What turns and manoeuvrings the unseen robot has to make as it traverses junctions and turns have been edited out, so the journey appears seamless, smooth, unhurried and inexorable. Projected on the end wall of an otherwise empty room, the camera, mounted on the robot, takes us on an apparently interminable trip.</p><p>Kanalvideo may lack the complexity and ingenious pyrotechnics of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/oct/10/comedy">Fischli and Weiss</a>’s best known, and much imitated, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXrRC3pfLnE">The Way Things Go</a>, or the pathos and humour of the pair’s rat-and-bear videos (in which the artists, dressed in animal costumes, encounter the human as well as the natural world), but it has unexpected mystery and magic. We have no idea of the size of the tunnel, as the camera passes over the riffles, rapids and pools of water flowing through the bottom of the pipe, until at one point a rat appears, clambering away from the light as the camera approaches. As we approach junctions in the tube, light catches the rims of sections of pipe where they join, a glowing corona against the blackness of the receding tunnel. After a bit you forget where you are, and think instead of an eye’s pupil staring back from the screen, or views of an eclipsed sun. I think about life’s journey, of being born and of a colonoscopy, and of that Swiss clinic where people go to die.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jan/17/fatberg-artists-fischli-weiss-sewer-review-spruth-magers">Continue reading...</a>

## Latest twist in Saracens salary cap scandal threatens a descent into pure farce  | Robert Kitson

The Saracens salary cap scandal has already deeply damaged the domestic league - but it now appears the worst is yet to come for the club, its players, and the game as a whole<p>What a mess. Not only for Saracens, currently neck-deep in a reputational slurry pit of their own making, but for everyone involved. And, talking to those at the heart of the onrushing scandal, there remains plenty more to come. Ordeur, ordeur! Saracens playing in the Championship next season is barely the half of it.</p><p>Consider, for example, the collateral damage that has already been done to English league rugby. Now triple it. If Saracens really have been operating over the salary cap this season by as much as £2m – having already been fined £5.36m and deducted 35 league points for breaching the cap for the previous three seasons – the situation is truly farcical. Talk about bare-faced cheek as well as brazen cheques.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jan/17/saracens-salary-cap-scandal-threatens-farce">Continue reading...</a>

## Let’s move to Sedbergh, Cumbria: lovely in its isolation

<p>A convivial and unpretentious ‘book town’, though it may be too lonely for some</p><p><strong>What’s going for it? </strong>Being an introvert, it’s the lonely spots that attract me most. Sedbergh is only 15 twisty-turny minutes up the steep western escarpment of the Yorkshire Dales from the M6, a little longer from Kendal, but high up, all alone in the fells, it might be halfway to the moon. Bald moors, big skies and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/alfred-wainwright" title="">Alfred Wainwright</a>’s beloved <a href="https://www.visitcumbria.com/peaks/howgills/" title="">Howgill Fells</a> loom all about, and there’s not much bar sheep, the <a href="https://www.wensleydale.co.uk/" title="">Wensleydale Creamery</a> and the odd village or teeny town between you and the other side of the UK. Bliss. I don’t think I’ve ever been lonelier, in a good way, than waiting on the platform at Garsdale station with only crows for company. Still, Sedbergh itself is a convivial spot, despite its isolation, and utterly unpretentious in the way only this part of the world can be – home to doughty shops, hardy people and excellent pubs where hikers battle farmers for space at the bar. And, as one of three of Britain’s “book towns” (with <a href="https://www.wigtown-booktown.co.uk/" title="">Wigtown</a> and Hay-on-Wye), filled with bookshops, writing retreats and poetry festivals, even the most taciturn hermit is never short of a conversation opener, even if it’s just your take on the latest Jack Reacher plot twist.</p><p><strong>The case against…</strong> When the wind blows, Sedbergh gets blown away.

Professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, Wood researches how habits guide behaviour and has written a new book about it: Good Habits, Bad Habits: The Science of Making Positive Changes That Stick. Not market-driven self-help, it is based on research, data, actual science. I hope she will help me to understand my bad habits, change them, and maybe even pick up a few good ones.</p><p>What are my unwanted habits, though, since I quit smoking? I should probably look at Twitter a little less, but that’s everyone, right? Or Facebook, Instagram; whatever it is you look at your phone for. There is a chapter at the end of Wood’s book, How to Stop Looking at Your Phone So Often. You have to start off by noticing you are doing it, then use some of the tools you have hopefully picked up in the preceding pages, such as controlling the cues to the behaviour, adding friction ... we will get to some of that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/17/nailbiter-to-keen-runner-the-three-secrets-to-turning-a-bad-habit-into-a-good-one">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nearly every family has a ‘fixer’ but when you can’t fix everyone, says Annalisa Barbieri, it’s time to step back</p><p><strong>I’m in my 40s, and have two brothers</strong><strong>. Our mother, despite a difficult marriage and divorce, is </strong><strong>happily married for the second time. Unfortunately, a huge rift has opened up between my two brothers and I don’t know what to do about it. </strong><strong>My older brother has two children; </strong><strong>he and his wife have been undergoing multiple rounds of IVF to produce his third (her second) child, sadly with</strong><strong>out success. A year ago, my younge</strong><strong>r brother announced that he and his wife were expecting their second child. My elder brother and his wife did not respond to this news, and have</strong><strong> gradually</strong><strong> disengaged from them completely, refusing to see their </strong><strong>daughter. </strong><strong>This has been incredibly difficult for us all.</strong></p><p><strong>My mother is distraught and has tried through multiple channels (verbally, by text and even a lengthy</strong><strong> but measured</strong><strong> letter) to persuade my elder brother to build bridges and visit his niece, who is not well. His response was to shout her down and ban her from seeing his </strong><strong>daughters. He has never been very rational and has done this before. My younger brother is so hurt by his brother’s reaction to his daughter, that he will not now engage with him, either.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/17/how-heal-terrible-rift-between-my-brothers-annalisa-barbieri">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Approaching the division of chores in a businesslike way could be the key to domestic harmony</p><p>In my house, obviously, we don’t need <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/fair-play-9781529400182.html" title="">Fair Play</a>, a recent book by the Harvard lawyer and organisational expert <a href="https://www.everodsky.com/" title="">Eve Rodsky</a> on the perennial question of how to get men (in heterosexual relationships) to do their share of household chores. That’s because I already do my share. Or I genuinely think I do – and will assert it, with the tiniest hint of bitterness, if challenged. Then again, how could the matter be definitively settled, without hiring a team of clipboard-wielding consultants to monitor my partner and me around the clock for a month?</p><p>Even that wouldn’t resolve things, really, because it all hinges on expectations. The reason I don’t vacuum as much as my partner is that I’m fine with less-vacuumed floors; meanwhile, a significant portion of the domestic labour I pride myself on doing consists of tidying that she, a non-neat-freak, considers unnecessary. Who is right? It’s a question as unanswerably profound as any philosopher might ponder, if she didn’t have so much damn laundry to do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/17/delegate-but-the-buck-stops-with-you-how-to-end-the-housework-wars">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Council promises to turn magnet for anti-social behaviour into ‘family-friendly’ civic space</p><p>At 5.30pm in Manchester’s Piccadilly Gardens, three police officers are gathered around a wheelchair parked in front of a gold postbox commemorating Team GB’s Olympic cycling success. Sitting in the chair, bent double, is a tiny woman with one leg. “Can you sit up, love?” the officers ask, coaxing her gently upright. They know her name. “We just wanted to check you were OK.” She mumbles that she’s fine. As they head off towards the statue of Queen Victoria, the woman immediately slumps forward again.</p><p>On a bench near the tram tracks, another drug casualty is frozen – a different kind of statue. He is holding a rolled-up cigarette, long extinguished in the evening drizzle. In a doorway by a branch of Greggs, three men with sleeping bags are sharing some pasties. In front of them, a preacher with a megaphone is telling commuters to repent or burn in hell. Outside Boots, two charity fundraisers working for Shelter flirt with commuters on their way up to Piccadilly station.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/17/manchester-piccadilly-gardens-revamp-city-centre">Continue reading...</a>

Few will have the teams of data scientists, money and know-how to create their own bespoke solutions, unless they’re operating in the AI sector themselves. Yet many will be using platforms and tools that already incorporate AI – anyone doing a Google search, for example, is experiencing it in action. “You can be sure there isn’t a human sitting in a cubicle, sifting by hand through the entire internet to decide which search result to serve you,” says Cassie Kozyrkov, chief decision scientist at Google.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business-rewired/2020/jan/17/tools-to-succeed-small-business-owners-reveal-the-tech-they-rely-on">Continue reading...</a>

Brexit is now a done deal; there are no knife-edge votes as the government can now do pretty much as it pleases; the Labour party is more focused on choosing a new leader than opposing; and no select committees have yet been established – partly because no one is yet sure what departmental reorganisations might be in store after 31 January but mainly because the government rather enjoys the lack of scrutiny. Obviously it may all change later in the year, but for now it still comes as a surprise when the highlight of the day is departmental questions. Even so, you still don’t have to look too hard for signs of grubbiness. Today I watched <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/13/nicky-morgans-journey-of-forgetfulness-leads-her-to-seat-in-lords">Nicky Morgan and Zac Goldsmith get togged up in ermine</a> for their introduction to the House of Lords. The Nicky Morgan who said she could never serve in a Boris Johnson government, told her constituents she was standing down to spend more time with her family, told journalists that she definitely had not been offered a job or a peerage during the election campaign and is now a cabinet minister subject to no democratic accountability. The Zac Goldsmith who once petitioned for voters to be allowed to recall MPs they don’t like and is now back in government having been kicked out of parliament by his Richmond Park constituency. They must both have been absolutely desperate for a title. Personally I don’t see the attraction. Then I’m not a politician.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jan/17/new-slower-reality-westminster-politics">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The prairie town of Andrew is no stranger to loss, but when its last grain elevator was slated for demolition, the community fought to win a stay of execution</p><p>For nearly a century, a wooden tower has loomed over the prairie town of Andrew in western Canada, rising from the rolling landscape land like a lone sentinel. Built during the agricultural boom of the early 20th century, the grain elevator – and six others that stood nearby – once bore testament to the town’s prosperity.</p><p>Today, the main street of Andrew is quiet, even on a weekday at noon. Many of the town’s storefronts are shuttered and all that remains of the railway line is a faint imprint on the ground. The local school only has 70 students, and residents wonder how long it can remain open.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/canada-prairie-castles-cathedrals-battle-to-save">Continue reading...</a>

<p>My brother had withdrawn his confession and my parents testified that at the time of the murder he was at home with them. I was sentenced to life</p><p>My brother, Tom, and I were never close. He was two years older than me. I don’t know why, but my parents sheltered him. They were farmers and we lived in Kansas with three older half-siblings. All us kids were in competition for their attention.</p><p>I moved out at 18 and found work at a local dairy farm where they were willing to teach me. My parents and Tom lived five miles away but I didn’t visit much. By the time I was 23, I was living with my wife and our two young sons. We’d been married three years but the relationship was rocky. That August, my wife’s sister, Camille, who was 14, moved in with us.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/17/experience-my-brother-framed-me-for-murder">Continue reading...</a>

## EU nationals are fearful. And after Windrush, they should be | Gaby Hinsliff

<p>For all the reassurances about their status, the risk of being kicked out still haunts those without a British passport</p><p>A few weeks ago, an old friend posted something on Facebook that stopped me in my tracks. He’s a GP, married to a teacher he met decades ago at university, with three children. They’re the sort of energetic, adventurous, public-spirited family who pitch in wherever help is needed and make me feel vaguely embarrassed about my own civic shortcomings. I have never known him be anything but laid-back, and although he’s originally Dutch, in theory he should have nothing to fear from Brexit: he has settled status, confirming the right to live and work here with his English wife and family after 31 January, just as before. But now he’s fearful. What if, the next time he needs to renew his passport for a family holiday, the computer says no? How can he be sure his life won’t unravel in some faceless official’s hands?</p><p>‘The despair is truly palpable now, and in some cases goes as far as suicidal thoughts'</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/17/eu-nationals-fearful-brexit-windrush">Continue reading...</a>

## ‘They will destroy you’: in Putin’s Russia, how far can an artist go?

A decade ago, a new spirit of tolerance of the avant garde blossomed in Russia. But these days, it’s impossible to know where the lines are – as the country’s most celebrated director discovered to his cost. By Joshua Yaffa<p>One Saturday evening in December 2017, as it has regularly for nearly 200 years, the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre, draped by its famous scarlet-and-gold curtain, featured the long-anticipated premiere of a new ballet. Tickets had sold out almost instantly. The Bolshoi’s capacious hall, ringed by teetering<strong> </strong>loggia boxes, was filled with so many members of the ruling elite that the event seemed an updated version of an old Communist party central committee congress.</p><p>The highly awaited ballet was a staging of the life and work of Rudolf Nureyev, the famed dancer and choreographer whose defection from the Soviet Union in 1961 made international headlines. The director was Kirill Serebrennikov, who, at 48, was Russia’s most celebrated theatrical figure, an artist whose tastes run to the experimental and provocative. The ballet, titled Nureyev, portrays its hero as a genius whose talent, like his idiosyncrasies, made him difficult for the bosses of the time to understand – an inevitable object of suspicion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/17/putin-kirill-serebrennikov-arts-clampdown-russia-bolshoi">Continue reading...</a>
