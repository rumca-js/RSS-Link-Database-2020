Windows 7 has officially reached it's end of life. This means it will no longer receive security updates, meaning it will be extremely dangerous to use going forward. In fact, it hasn't even received any feature updates since 2015. No matter how stubborn you are, you may as well bite the bullet and upgrade to Windows 10, especially considering you can still do it for free.
