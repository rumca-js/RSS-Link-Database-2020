Bailey Cogan (keyboards/vocals), Karl Remus (guitar), Warren Thomas Fenzi (drums), Daniel Chavez (trumpet), and Christian Wheeler (bass) have been releasing music as 26 BATS! since 2017. Cogan says that the band's music is "very fluid; it is very me. I use jazz chords, but it's not really jazz. It has elements of jazz, R&B, alternative rock. I feel like when I'm writing for 26 BATS!, I know it's 26 BATS! because it's a scene in my head — it's the color purple, or it's a night sky with stars and moons. It's going to emulate a vision."

The Minneapolis ensemble kick off The Current's 15th Anniversary, live from First Avenue in Minneapolis, Minn.
