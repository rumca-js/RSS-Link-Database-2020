Skyrim VR. I may describe Skyrim VR like it is an absolute nightmare but listen closely and you\u2019ll be able to tell its all for fun, this game is the best and easily the best VR game by miles. This is why forever\n\nAll my music and sound is from here: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/8pficg\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/user?u=2784847 \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/upisnotjump \nMy amazing poster: https://www.pixelempire.com/products/upisnotjump\n\nSkyrim VR had none of the problems Fallout 4 VR had on release, I discuss all the things in Skyrim VR that are an absolute nightmare but overall it vastly improves Skyrim vanilla and Bethesda did a great job. I do feela  few things were missing from the release of Skyrim VR but these can easily be fixed with a few mods, I consider modding Skyrim VR an absolute necessity , without it perhaps Skyrim VR really is an absolute nightmare\u2026\n\nIf you enjoy my \u2018This Is Why\u2019 series please do let me know what you like and what I should do more of, I will eventually move away from VR for a little while and start doing commentary on gameplay, it will just be me having highly edited adventures, I won\u2019t let the quality drop.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRbOsXg0ISg", "date_published": "2020-01-31 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
