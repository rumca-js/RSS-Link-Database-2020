You can have color emojis in suckless software now due to a fix in libxft! Color emojis will no longer crash st, dmenu and dwm. I already have them working in my st build, but I'm sure that soon you'll be able to have color emojis in your dwm statusbar as well. Will normies take over suckless software now?
