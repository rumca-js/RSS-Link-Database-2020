<p>On the most significant day in British politics for a generation, the PM hides inside No 10</p><p>Just imagine a country about to take a giant leap into the unknown. A future sold on the basis of promises no one is certain can be kept. Now imagine the person least suitable to be prime minister at this time. A man whose entire career has been built on lies, deceit and self-destruction. A narcissist whose concentration span barely extends to the end of a senten … On second thoughts, don’t bother. You’ve got him already.</p><p>There are a couple of ways of interpreting Boris Johnson’s three-minute cameo posted on his Facebook page at 10pm. Neither shows the prime minister in a particularly good light. The first and the most obvious is that Boris really doesn’t give much of a toss.

But, phew, saving people’s lives takes it out of all context.” It took Tony Adams a long time to really recognise what he has achieved with the Sporting Chance Clinic, the charity he established to provide support for sports professionals with mental health and addiction issues.</p><p>“Sometimes I have put myself on the cross in sobriety, definitely the early years. I didn’t feel the effect of the charity for a long time. I feel amazing now that I started this. I am going to cry if I am not careful.” Adams’s voice cracks before he continues: “I will cry later.

<p>Coronavirus is a test of the Chinese government.

She was the only person wearing a face mask. At the time, the official line was that everything was under control and the spread of the virus would be prevented. “The Huanan seafood market is only two blocks away,” I teased, a reference to the epicentre of the outbreak. In an all-night restaurant, the glass tanks were swimming with life. We ate noodles with crab legs. The streets were packed, drunk revellers hailing cabs after their end-of-year company parties. A man doubled over to vomit and a young woman patted him on the back: “Ready for another round?”</p><p>A week ago, the panic was still confined to health-conscious retirees, always prone to worrying about seasonal illnesses. News of a virus just gave older people another reason to instruct the young: don’t go out, drink plenty of water. There were also the conspiracy theorists who doubted official news but couldn’t provide more reliable information. To most of us, not wearing a mask seemed reasonable and logical.

In Ireland, we will always regret that our closest neighbour and partner will no longer sit with us and the other member states around the EU table in Brussels.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/leave-eu-europe-britain">We leave the EU tonight – but Europe is still alive in people’s hearts | Gaby Hinsliff</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/ireland-uk-brexit-peace-good-friday-agreement">Continue reading...</a>

That is why Jane (a brilliant Julia Garner), the recent college graduate through whose eyes we observe a pattern of sexism and (implied) sexual abuse, is often found hesitating, simultaneously swallowing her concerns and setting her face.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/saudi-runaway-documentary-escape-filmed-cellphone">Saudi Runaway: behind a suspenseful and courageous documentary</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/31/the-assistant-kitty-green-metoo-weinstein-inspired-thriller">Continue reading...</a>

## In order to survive as chancellor, Sajid Javid is having to adapt quickly | Katy Balls

<p>There’s a sense Javid is in the role because he is compliant. But even that hasn’t been enough to win over everyone inside No 10</p><p>There’s a sign in the Treasury building that reads: “Strong economy”. The placard made its way to the government building from one of the 2019 election rallies. While the economy may not have been front and centre of the Conservative campaign – “Get Brexit done” was the star of the show – it is there to serve as a reminder that strong economics must underline any well-functioning Tory government.</p><p>To some who see it, it also serves as a reminder of an ongoing tussle between No 10 and No 11 on fiscal discipline. Ahead of the election, the chancellor won a crucial battle on economic spending. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/sajid-javid" title="">Sajid Javid</a> – backed by the election campaign director, Isaac Levido – led the call for the party not to go too big on spending pledges to win over Labour voters and risk its reputation in the process. This led to the birth of Javid’s fiscal rules, which will dictate how far the government can go in the three big events of the year: the budget, spending review and autumn budget. Under the chancellor’s rules, he will run a balanced current budget, invest no more than 3% of GDP and review the borrowing limit if debt interest begins to rise. This was one of the few battles Javid has won since Johnson appointed him as chancellor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/31/sajid-javid-adapt-quickly">Continue reading...</a>

## The race to grieve: how social media has made professional mourners of us all | Max Rushden

While it is no one’s place to tell anyone else how to express sadness or pain, it sometimes feels there is a race to show that you have the most compassion<p>There is a tradition dating back to ancient Egyptian times for professional mourners who would turn up at funerals of people they had never met. They would perform various roles – wailing uncontrollably, dancing, or just paying their respects. They can be found in the Old Testament, and the first reports of it in China are from the 8th century.</p><p>A similar service was on offer in Essex for £45 until the middle of 2019. According to rentamourner.co.uk it closed down because it was “too difficult to scale this operation to serve the whole country”. Bizarre as it might sound, there was a market for it – providing solace to a family who wanted there to be more people at a funeral. To suspend reality or to give someone the send off they deserved.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jan/31/kobe-bryant-death-social-media">Continue reading...</a>

And when I say never, I mean never. She is the type of voter whom the Conservative party would largely regard as one of their traditional supporters: an older, affluent member of the professional class, who believes that any amount of racial discrimination can be overcome through focus and hard work. She was the one who brought up the subject, and her voice carried an unusual level of distress. She had gone into work one morning, where she has a senior role, and as she walked past reception a couple of the youngest staff members there called over to her, since one of them had an enquiry for her.

<p>Beware the tricks of consumer capitalism </p><p>Minimalism is dead. The lifestyle trend that dominated the 2010s expired late last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2019/nov/19/therapeutic-tuning-fork-unnecessary-item-marie-kondo-queen-of-tidying-online-shop" title="">when Marie Kondo launched an online store</a> selling upmarket housewares, thereby destroying the pretence that decluttering was about buying less stuff, as opposed to making space for new stuff. Kyle Chayka’s new book, <a href="https://www.kylechayka.com/book/" title="">The Longing For Less: Living With Minimalism</a>, might serve as its obituary. Minimalism seemed like “a conscientious way of approaching the world now that we have realised that materialism... is literally destroying the planet,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/03/empty-promises-marie-kondo-craze-for-minimalism" title="">he writes</a>. But it soon became just another mode of materialism – a way for the system that caused the problem to make more money by selling what it claimed would be the cure.</p><p>So what’s next? The commodification of cosiness. In book publishing, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/22/hygge-conspiracy-denmark-cosiness-trend" title="">the process of what you might call “hyggification”</a> is already so advanced that you’d be forgiven for not being able to tell your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/sep/10/the-little-book-of-lykke-meik-wiking-danish-happiest-people-digested-read" title=""><em>lykke</em></a> from your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/lagom-sweden-hygge-lifestyle-trends" title=""><em>lagom</em></a><em>,</em> or your <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/ikigai-the-japanese-secret-to-a-long-and-happy-life-might-just-help-you-live-a-more-fulfilling-9871d01992b7" title=""><em>ikigai</em></a> from your <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/nov/11/what-is-nunchi-the-korean-secret-to-happiness" title=""><em>nunchi</em></a>. But you can expect it to spread through the rest of the consumer economy soon. The world is an increasingly alarming place, and the prospect of shutting the door on it grows ever more appealing. Now the focus is on fluffy bedding; on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jul/09/the-gravity-blanket-promises-a-gentle-loving-embrace-but-will-it-help-me-sleep" title="">weighted blankets</a>, originally used for treating autism spectrum disorders <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/on-and-off-the-avenue/the-seductive-confinement-of-a-weighted-blanket-in-an-anxious-time" title="">but now marketed as stress relief for all</a>; on wearable duvets apparently known as <a href="https://offhours.co/collections/shop-all" title="">“homecoats”</a>; and on home cooking – but using <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/nov/01/cooking-for-dummies-rhik-sammader-tests-recipe-uks-top-boxes" title="">pricey, prepared recipe boxes</a>, of course. “Before, what was soothing was a house with white walls and no furniture‚ and now what’s soothing is a house from the 1840s with dark paintings on the walls,” Helena Hambrecht, co-founder of the low-alcohol aperitif company <a href="https://drink.haus/" title="">Haus</a>, which brands itself as cosiness in a bottle, told <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/1/15/21063670/hygge-self-care-domestic-cozy-marketing-brands-haus" title="">Vox</a> website the other day. “We’ve been sitting [at] our computers in our modern apartments for the last 10 years and we’re all miserable.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/31/first-kondo-now-cosy-but-do-you-have-to-buy-into-lifestyle-trends">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From rewatching 1990s TV shows to replaying classic computer games, taking the safe option when it comes to entertainment can help audiences rediscover themselves</p><p>Never before has civilisation produced so much new pop culture. From the plethora of TV shows on competing streaming platforms to the seemingly infinite choice offered by online music and gaming services, the wealth of new material being released each month is staggering. Yet when it comes to cultural consumption, audiences are increasingly choosing to seek out classic, safe bets – forgoing the next big thing in favour of the last big thing.</p><p>According to UK media watchdog Ofcom, the single most-watched programme in the first quarter of 2019 was the 1990s sitcom Friends. In the US, the top Netflix spot has long been held by the US version of the Office, which first aired 15 years ago. Meanwhile at the box office, sequels and reboots abound. Last year’s top five grossing films in the UK included the remake of the Lion King, Toy Story 4, Frozen 2 and Star Wars: Episode IX – the Rise of Skywalker.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/safe-is-the-new-bold/2020/jan/31/back-to-the-future-why-are-we-opting-for-nostalgic-pop-culture">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There’s no shame in doing something you know to be great. Alexi Duggins explains why playing it safe is a smarter step </p><p>Has there ever been a more underrated word in the English language than “safe”? For something that is fundamentally a good thing, people can be weirdly dismissive about it. Eyes are rolled at workplace health and safety as though it’s somehow uncool to not lose a hand to poorly maintained machinery. Romcoms lazily wield it as an unflattering cliche: “Oh, I don’t know. My award-winning humanitarian of a partner is perfect in every conceivable way – but they’re just so … safe, you know?”</p><p>Meanwhile, there’s no bigger cliche than being edgy just for the sake of trend-chasing. Over the past two decades, the fad for extreme sports has reached (and plummeted from) ever-crazier heights. Our fetishisation of high-risk, high-wire living has even spread to dining, with foodies flocking to increasingly ridiculous eateries simply because they look cool on social media. How many times have our friends told us they tried out a Hot New Place that wasn’t actually very good – while we pity their gullibility and coo soothing words such as: “Oh what a shame that insect-based menu wasn’t actually that delicious.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/safe-is-the-new-bold/2020/jan/31/take-the-safe-option-its-time-to-ditch-edgy-fads">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A resident describes life in the city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak</p><p><strong>Thursday 23 January (first day of lockdown) </strong>At 2am the government says my home town, Wuhan, is soon to be placed under lockdown. All the trains, flights and public transport will be cancelled. People have talked about the virus for a while. The spread of the outbreak is getting worse. I suppose it is the right decision.</p><p>When I go outdoors I am cautious and mostly stay in the car. There are 11 million people in my city but the streets are empty. We have never seen it like this before. It’s normal for a lot of the stores to be shut during Chinese new year but this is different. I’m lucky to find masks on my second run to a pharmacy. I go to the supermarket but vegetables are sold out.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/the-city-is-suffocating-diary-of-the-wuhan-coronavirus-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The national ballet troupe will become the first classical company in the world to perform an entire year of works choreographed by women</p><p>It’s an ethereal art form in which dancers, who are overwhelmingly female, strive for unattainable perfection performing works almost always created by men. But in uncompromising world of ballet, where the work of female choreographers is often relegated to one-off showcases while men take the spotlight, a ballet company in New Zealand is making history with a whole year of performances that put women creators centre stage.</p><p>“For 14 years I’d only ever performed works by men,” says Alice Topp, a ballerina and, in 2018, the second woman ever to hold the post of resident choreographer at the Australian Ballet in its almost 60-year history. Now, she perches on a Swiss ball in the Royal New Zealand Ballet’s light, airy rehearsal studios in Wellington, still sweating from the morning class she has just ducked out of, hair loose around her shoulders.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/01/all-men-for-150-years-women-take-centre-stage-at-royal-new-zealand-ballet">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Uig Community Centre, Isle of Lewis<br /></strong>Julia Taudevin’s show about the Gaelic tradition of singing for the dead takes us on a dizzying spin through space and time</p><p>It’s based on <a href="http://www.keeningwake.com/keening-tradition">keening rituals</a>, the ancient Gaelic tradition of singing for the dead, but Julia Taudevin’s Move~Gluasad is driven less by grief than by the pulse of life. Where many shows about mourning become inert, trapped by an emotion that has no release, this one seems to see death as part of a cycle, both end point and new beginning; sad, horrific, terrifying, yes, but also as inevitable as the ebb and flow of the sea.</p><p>The luminous moons cradled by the five performers seem to set the show’s tidal rhythm. It’s as if their gravitational pull is governing the women’s gorgeous singing, which belongs in some otherworldly place of raw emotion, just as it does the fluid form of Taudevin’s script.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jan/31/move-gluasad-julia-taudevin-celtic-connections">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The betrayed wife</p><p>After 22 years together, I discovered my partner has been having sex with someone else. A text message describing the “intense pleasure” experienced last time they met, was mistakenly sent to me rather than her. Sex now inhabits the majority of my waking thoughts – imagining him with her, and desiring sex between him and me.</p><p>We met aged 18 and 19; the yearning for each other’s bodies was unquenchable. Into our 30s, sex was regular and loving. At 40, we stopped making love altogether. I tried to suggest my continued desire through clothes and gestures, but my attempts were missed. I knew something was wrong, but was scared of the truth. In retrospect, I think our mutual silence created space for infidelity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jan/31/my-life-in-sex-wife-been-cheated-on">Continue reading...</a>

## Bong Bong’s Manila Kanteen, London E2: ‘It's a get-stuck-in kind of joint’ - restaurant review | Grace Dent

<p>A slightly chaotic but warm-hearted Filipino street-food joint that doesn’t play by the rules </p><p>When <a href="https://bbqdreamz.co.uk/" title="">BBQ Dreamz</a> scooped £350,000 on BBC Two’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b3pt5h/episodes/guide" title="">My Million Pound Menu</a> last year, the cash came with the advice that their street food stall’s name suggested nothing of its Filipino flavours and that a name upgrade was sorely needed. “Hold my coat,” they replied – or at least I like to think they did – before settling on <a href="https://bongbongs.co.uk/" title="">Bong Bong’s Manila Kanteen</a> and opening their first bricks-and-mortar site in east London. No one is going to forget that name. Or miss the enormous, American mustard-yellow and neon-pink electric sign in the window of their new Hackney Road premises.</p><p>Bong Bong’s Manila Kanteen sounds like a jazz-fusion noise-terror 12-piece who are here to liven up your wedding. In actual fact, for those not au fait with the Filipino political landscape, Bongbong is the nickname of <a href="https://www.biography.com/political-figure/imelda-marcos" title="">Imelda Marcos</a>’ son, the politician Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Researching the heady life and times of Bongbong – from child star to senator, and on to his latest bid to revise the textbooks and gloss-coat the doings of his dictator father – led me down such a delicious wormhole, I really needed my dinner by the time I scrambled out of the house.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jan/31/bong-bongs-manila-kanteen-london-e2-grace-dent-restaurant-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>After a few years, I came to understand Instagram dwellers as broken people – my people. By Dayna Tortorici</p><p>I had reached the point of diminishing returns. I wanted to quit Twitter, but my fingers were as if possessed, typing <em>command+n</em>, <em>tw</em>, <em>enter</em> at any lull in the workday, letting autofill take care of the rest. Like an old woman who finds herself at a familiar bus stop in her nightgown, I would blink at the new window and wonder how I got there and where I had intended to go. More than once I asked a friend to change my password and lock me out of my account. Weeks would go by without incident, sometimes months, but then a protest would break out, or my hometown would be on fire, and the old media was too slow with the news. I would go through the password retrieval process, log on, catch up, lose my mind and repeat the process.</p><p>Finally, in July 2018, I thought: I’m going to have a heart attack if I stay on here.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/31/infinite-scroll-life-under-instagram">Continue reading...</a>

This ambitious debut novel from the leading American thinker is set on a Virginia plantation<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/oct/08/ta-nehisi-coates-our-story-is-a-tragedy-but-doesnt-depress-me-we-were-eight-years-in-power-interview" title="">Ta-Nehisi Coates’s </a>eagerly awaited and ambitious debut novel is set in pre-civil war Virginia, on a slave plantation called Lockless in Starfall, Elm County. The stars of Lockless and other neighbouring plantations are indeed beginning to fade and fall: the slave owners, through a mixture of ineptitude and greed, have worked their lands to exhaustion and are now reduced to selling off their slaves to maintain their lives of idle luxury. Virginia is a hierarchy; at the top are the Quality, white slave owners with the power of life and death over their chief possession, their slaves. Next are the Low – poor whites, mostly uneducated, employed by the Quality to supervise the plantations and keep the enslaved in check. After them are the Freed, former slaves who were able to buy their own freedom. At the very bottom are the Tasked, the enslaved.</p><p>The main character and narrator, Hiram, is no ordinary slave. He is gifted with, among other things, a photographic memory; he is also son to Mr Howell Walker, the plantation owner. Howell acknowledges Hiram as his son; he takes him out of the fields and makes him a house slave, sometimes letting him entertain dinner guests with memory tricks, and even assigning to him the same teacher as his other son – and heir – the foolish, bumbling Maynard. This open recognition by his father encourages Hiram to believe in a special destiny for himself, and “in my quiet moments, to imagine myself in their ranks” – this despite constant warnings from Thena, an older slave and Hiram’s adoptive mother, that to the Quality he will always remain a slave.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jan/31/the-water-dancer-ta-nehisi-coates-review">Continue reading...</a>

Ndidi, meanwhile, has been outstanding and, if he dominates central midfield again on Saturday, then Leicester will probably put their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jan/28/aston-villa-leicester-city-carabao-cup-semi-final-second-leg-match-report">Carabao Cup disappointment</a> behind them, take a significant step closer to Champions League qualification, and make the jostling for fourth place very interesting. <strong>PD</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jan/31/premier-league-10-things-to-look-out-for-this-weekend">Continue reading...</a>
