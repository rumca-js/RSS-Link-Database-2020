Billingham, Brent and Medawar began their landmark experiments inspired by previous observations. The US immunogeneticist Ray Owen had shown in 1945 that dizygotic (fraternal) twin calves have red blood cell chimerism, the red blood cells of each mingling with others originating from their twin while in the womb. Owen postulated that precursor red cells must have been exchanged before birth, that the foreign cells had been accepted, and that they had established their own lineage. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/02/leslie-baruch-brent-obituary\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jan/02/leslie-baruch-brent-obituary", "date_published": "2020-01-02 17:47:22+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Tune-free pop and the new Katie Hopkins: our 2020 celebrity predictions", "description": "<p>What does our crystal ball say the new year will bring for celebs?

I was born in Kinshasa in the Congo, a society in which men hold hands to show the affection and bond we feel for each other. As we walked on to his housing estate, a group of teenagers spotted us. I could see the looks of disgust on their faces. I heard one of them call out: \u201cYo, big man. You holding hands, yeah.\u201d I looked over. His eyes punched through my chest. I felt my legs shake as if my knees were going to buckle. I can still remember the sting in my heart. The experience made me question what \u201cnormal\u201d was, and highlighted contradictions in my own sense of masculinity. </p><p>I had a good childhood. I had a close family and felt love. But as I got older, I struggled with my mental health. From around 18 until my mid-20s, I experienced depression, anxiety and social isolation. When making a phone call, I\u2019d have to rehearse the conversation before I could pick up and dial. There would be times when, if I didn\u2019t want attention, I\u2019d just avoid a situation altogether. At university, if I was late to a lecture, I just wouldn\u2019t go in \u2013 pushing those doors open and letting people see me was the worst feeling in the world.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/02/manhood-mental-health-masculinity\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/02/manhood-mental-health-masculinity", "date_published": "2020-01-02 16:01:15+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Lust in translation: how we fell for the people giving arthouse auteurs a voice", "description": "<p>When Bong Joon-ho went on the Jimmy Fallon show, the Parasite director\u2019s interpreter made viewers swoon \u2013 casting a light on the people who speak English for the likes of Michael Haneke and Park Chan-wook</p><p>Just when you thought Bong Joon-ho \u2013 the affable maestro of Korean cinema and now, with his class-conscious Cannes winner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/parasite-review-bong-joon-ho\" title=\"\">Parasite</a>, champion of the people \u2013 could not get any more lovable, they let him on Jimmy Fallon.
