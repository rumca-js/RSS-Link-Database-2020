War is to government what life and death is to humans. If nations can meet the challenge of war, they\u2019ll survive. If it can\u2019t, they\u2019ll perish.\n\nWar can also be looked at as a racket.\n\nIf you can help governments in their primal act of survival to remain in power by offering raw materials, weapons, soldiers, services to soldiers; you\u2019re gonna be the government\u2019s best friend.\n\nNormal business profit margins are around 10%, give or take. \nBut war-time profits? We\u2019re talking 20%, 60%, 100%, 300%, 800%, the sky is the limit!\n\nDuPont for example during WWI, during the war-time years, their profits increased by more than 950%!\nOr take the Central Leather Company at that time, in the three years before the war, profits were around $3.5m. In 1916? $15m.\n\nDuring the Iraq War, often called the most privatized war in history; KBR, the main logistics supplier contractor for the US, we\u2019re talking food, facilities, etc., got a whopping $39.5b in Iraq-related contracts\n\nKBR\u2019s parent company, Halliburton\u2019s CEO was paid $42.6m in 2004\nCACI\u2019s CEO made a fairly decent $22.2m in 2004\nTITAN? He takes the crown with a $47.2m income in 2004 and 5\n\nIf you look throughout history - funding and supplying the enemy is all in a days work as a War Profiteer\n\nIn the War Industry: your customers are all the governments of the world.\n\nYou can\u2019t make war-time profits... if there isn\u2019t a war.\n\nThe general public usually never wants to go to war\n\nNow is the time to lobby for war, push for more conflicts, max out your campaign contributions, get the media involved\n\n-----------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcbe My Editing Software: http://bit.ly/jt-CC\n\n\ud83c\udfa5 My Video Gear, Tech, Books That Changed My Life, & more! https://amzn.to/2XZSXhx\n\n\ud83d\udcdc Exact resume I used to get my $40/hr remote web dev job + a stupid amount of bonuses \ud83d\udc49 http://bit.ly/resume-secrets-now\n\n\ud83c\udf05 Join my Facebook Group for going remote: http://bit.ly/remote-job\n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
