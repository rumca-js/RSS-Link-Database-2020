On this Babylon Bee podcast, Kyle and Ethan talk about the biggest stories of the week like our cities burning down, the most righteous heroes of the riots, SpaceX scrubbing a launch because of a nosy Karen, and all our politicians suddenly became Bible experts overnight.

Be sure to stick around for the main topic where two white guys decide to talk about critical race theory in the church and society, because why not?
