This is a BIG episode; I'm going to walk you through deploying a monitoring stack (Prometheus, AlertManager, and Grafana) on the Turing Pi K3s cluster so you can see how it's performing. Then I'll deploy Drupal and Wordpress, two popular PHP-based website building CMSes. And then for a little more fun, I deploy Minecraft server using Helm. Then I deploy Pi-hole for ad blocking and custom DNS!

I also am revealing my open source Turing Pi Cluster project on GitHub, to go along with the video series: https://github.com/geerlingguy/turing-pi-cluster

More details and links (along with a transcript) are available on my blog: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/raspberry-pi-cluster-episode-4-minecraft-pi-hole-grafana-and-more
