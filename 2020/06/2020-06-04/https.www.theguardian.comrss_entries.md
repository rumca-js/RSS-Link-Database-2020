<p>Even our transport secretary is now running on fumes, unveiling face mask measures others made law a month ago</p><p>A few days ago, the prime minister announced that he was doing away with the daily coronavirus briefings at weekends. It was just getting too hard to find cabinet ministers who were prepared to give up their Saturdays and Sundays – even the ever loyal “cut out and keep” Tory boy pastiche, Robert Jenrick, was playing hard to get – and Boris Johnson sure as hell couldn’t be bothered to do it himself.</p><p>It can’t be long before No 10 pursues its dream of reducing the number still further, if Thursday’s showing is anything to go by. One – two at a push – a week would be just about ideal. A win-win situation that would cut the workload and save the daily embarrassment of a minister having to explain that the government really didn’t have much of a clue what it was doing and was just making up policy on the hoof.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/04/fall-guy-shapps-takes-turn-to-promote-uk-as-world-beater-in-stupidity-transport-face-mask">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Based on the adventures of Anthony Horowitz’s adolescent secret agent, this new series is an improbable, action-packed romp for all your escapism needs</p><p>Would you by any chance – I’m just hazarding a guess – be in the mood for a little light relief? Would you seize an opportunity for mindless fun that will not deplete your emotional or mental resources in the same way that engaging with the real world – where to ingest one minute of headline news is to hole yourself beneath the psychic waterline – unavoidably does?</p><p>You would? Good news – Amazon Prime recognises you and delivers unto you an eight-part adaptation of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/mar/16/anthony-horowitz-alex-rider-interview">Anthony Horowitz’s bestselling&nbsp;Alex&nbsp;Rider&nbsp;books</a>. This initial outing is based on the second book – Point Blanc – with the origin story from book one worked in so that we all know how an unassuming schoolboy becomes the keystone upon which the entirety of “a specialised subdivision of the British security intelligence service” depends. (Stormbreaker, the inaugural adventure, was presumably skipped over by the TV execs as a result of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/jul/21/family.comedy">deeply unsuccessful film version that was released in 2006</a>. As it centres on a plot to release a deadly virus into schools, they must be on their knees thanking the god of bullets dodged.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/04/alex-rider-review-slick-silly-fun-with-the-teenage-james-bond">Continue reading...</a>

It’s what happens in this thoroughly sweet-natured, charming and unassuming British film, adapted by screenwriter Lisa Owens from the 2012 graphic novel by Joff Winterhart, with a creamy soundtrack by Belle and Sebastian. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/simon-bird">Simon Bird</a> (best known for playing Will in TV’s The Inbetweeners) makes his directorial debut.&nbsp;</p><p>Earl Cave and Monica Dolan play metalhead teenager Daniel Bagnold and his gentle, sad, divorced mum, Sue Bagnold, failing to get on with each other over an interminable summer in the epically boring British suburbs. Daniel is crucified with disappointment when a summer holiday with his dad in Florida is cancelled and Sue is justifiably afraid that he will take his rage out on her.

<p>Yes, more people of black, Latin and south Asian origin are dying, but there is no genetic ‘susceptibility’ behind it</p><p>From the start of the coronavirus pandemic, there has been an attempt to use science to explain the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on different groups through the prism of race.

<p>Plenty of reality shows have foreign counterparts, but while they are sometimes better, they are never quite what you expect</p><p>Realistically, Love Island was never going to come back properly this year. After all, a socially distanced Love Island sounds about as fun as a Love Island where all the contestants have to wear clothes or are capable of independent thought. However, all is not lost. Love Island might have fallen to the coronavirus, but ITV has announced that it’ll be airing Love Island Australia in its place this summer.</p><p>You probably have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, if you like Love Island then any Love Island is better than no Love Island. But on the other, ITV2 is broadcasting the first series of Love Island Australia, which aired in 2018, which means you might as well just read its Wikipedia page and be done with it. I did, and now I know who fought, who had sex, who won and how long they lasted in the real world. I also know that one of the games in the series is called Any Hole is a Goal, which sort of makes me want to watch it less.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/04/love-island-in-the-time-of-corona-will-an-aussie-replacement-suffice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Bayern Munich midfielder on playing without fans, not having to shout at the referee and the chip that appeared to settle the title race</p><p>“This year we have to drink all the beer,” Joshua Kimmich says, his tone deadpan as he ponders how weird it would be for Bayern Munich not to have their traditional beer-throwing celebration in front of their supporters if they win the Bundesliga this season. “I cannot imagine it now. I just know that it is strange if you win a game at the Allianz Arena and cannot celebrate with your fans. But we don’t have the choice now.”</p><p>Bayern’s outstanding midfielder can be forgiven for his confidence.

When actor John Boyega, from Star Wars and Attack the Block, addressed protesters at a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/thousands-gather-in-london-for-george-floyd-protest">Black Lives Matter rally in London’s Hyde Park</a>, he said: “I’m speaking to you from my heart. Look, I don’t know if I’m going to have a career after this, but fuck that.” Social media exploded with knowing jeers and giggling gotchas about how, actually, Boyega <em>had</em> to protest, or else his career would suffer! People on Twitter who had shown no very obvious knowledge of or interest in the issue of civil rights or Hollywood politics before this, were suddenly intoxicated by their delicious paradox, and made Boyega’s comments the pretext of once again righteously smashing the 5G mast of liberal power.</p><p>I don’t think Boyega’s comments will have any effect on his career, either good or bad. The career of this excellent actor was in great shape before this and it will continue to be in great shape. But vehement protests of this high-profile kind are not quite as commonplace as you might assume. Although protests about <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd">George Floyd</a> have been replicated in cities around the world, there is no evidence of compulsory virtue-signalling from actors. In the US, there have been protests from Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan and many others, but it’s naive to imagine agents in LA calling their clients and ordering them to join in. For every celebrity or public figure who speaks out, many more keep their heads down.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/04/john-boyega-challenged-racism-movie-star-hyde-park-speech">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having been starved of football for months, excitement got the better of the limited number of fans at the Hungarian cup final</p><p>With chanting, drums and some very loosely enforced social distancing regulations, the Hungarian cup final on Wednesday evening almost felt like a normal football match. The game, which Budapest club Honvéd won 2-1 against underdogs Mezokovesd, was the first big game in Europe to be played in front of paying spectators since coronavirus led to the suspension of live sport across most of the world in March.</p><p>Roughly 10,000 fans were allowed into the 65,000-seater Puskás Arena for the match, and while social distancing regulations meant spectators had to sit four seats apart from each other, hardcore fans ignored their ticket numbers to gather behind the two goals. At the whistle, hundreds of Honved fans jumped and cheered in close proximity, in scenes that may prove controversial if there is any spike in the country’s coronavirus case numbers in coming weeks.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/04/the-atmosphere-was-brilliant-fans-fail-to-keep-their-distance-in-hungary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The US has more to lose from rising economic nationalism than some of its politicians realise</p><p>The post-pandemic world economy seems likely to be a far less globalised economy, with political leaders and publics rejecting openness in a manner unlike anything seen since the tariff wars and competitive devaluations of the 1930s. And the byproduct will be not just slower growth but a significant fall in national incomes for all but perhaps the largest and most diversified economies.</p><p>In his prescient 2001 book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674010079&amp;content=toc">The End of Globalisation</a>, the Princeton economic historian&nbsp;<a href="https://www.project-syndicate.org/columnist/harold-james">Harold James</a>&nbsp;showed how an earlier era of global economic and financial integration collapsed under the pressures of unexpected events during the Great Depression of the 1930s, culminating in the second world war.

<p>Cocktails on a deck by the Saigon river, a beer on a Portuguese cliff face, and a Belgian bar that might leave you shoeless quench our tipsters’ thirst</p><p>We stumbled across Dulle Griet in Ghent last year. It is a fantastic traditional Flemish pub, serving over 500 beers from across the country. The decor was great and staff very friendly. The highlight of the bar is the MAX, a strong beer served in a huge two-litre glass. In an effort to stop people stealing or breaking their glasses, you must give a deposit of one shoe when ordering the MAX, a ceremonial bell is rung and the shoe is suspended in a basket above the bar until the glass is returned. They are limited to one per customer – definitely a wise choice!<br /><strong>Mike L</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/04/probably-the-best-bar-in-the-world-readers-travel-tips">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rather than pitting old people against the young, now is the time to unite against a system that only benefits those who are wealthy<br /><br /></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>During the first weeks of the coronavirus lockdown in the United States and Britain, a <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/convincing-boomer-parents-to-take-the-coronavirus-seriously">flurry</a> of media commentary centred around issues of generational difference in response to the pandemic. “Boomer” parents, although at heightened risk of deadly complications from contracting Covid-19, were apparently not taking the virus seriously enough. They flouted social distancing measures in favour of bridge games and cruise trips. The young, it seemed, were the adults in the room, begging for seriousness from their at-risk elders.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, these stories were media <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/epgkb7/if-your-aging-parents-are-ignoring-coronavirus-risks-youre-not-alone">trend</a> pieces and glossed anecdotes drenched in unspoken class assumptions. These reckless parents in their 60s and 70s had accrued enough capital to be cruise-tripping and golfing; they owned the homes where they should have been sheltering. And, as it turns out, the narrative of “unserious boomers” and “cautious millennials” obscured more than it revealed. The New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-baby-boomers.html">reported</a> that a higher percentage of Americans born between 1946 and 1964 were practising social distancing than people born after 1980. Not to mention that many thousands of older essential workers, from nurses to supermarket workers, were left out of this tale of generational difference and indifference.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/04/how-coronavirus-could-bridge-generational-divides-not-widen-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In March, couples in England were advised to move in together or stay apart to avoid coronavirus. What happened to those in new relationships who went for it?</p><p>Hurtling down the motorway on a Triumph T120 with a backpack full of knickers, Jen Lewandowski thought: <em>this is terrific.</em> Lewandowski, 41, had met Tom Gidley, 51, just four times before she moved into his Ramsgate home at the beginning of the coronavirus lockdown in March.&nbsp;</p><p>They originally met through work. Lewandowski had contacted Gidley, who is an artist, to ask if she could sell some of his paintings at an exhibition she was staging. When she collected the paintings from his studio in January, there was an instant connection. “She had an energy and real light about her,” says Gidley. After the show opened in March, they went for a drink, and then a cup of tea at Lewandowski’s kitchen table. Finally, Lewandowski, who lives in London, visited him for the weekend.&nbsp;<br /><br />Then the lockdown measures were announced. “I said: ‘Look, why don’t you just come down here?’” says Gidley. “Everything’s getting a bit strange.” She agreed, and Gidley collected her on his motorcycle. Since that high-speed jaunt, their relationship has barely slackened in pace. They have spent the entire lockdown together, said “I love you” to each other within days and are in general horribly in love. “Isn’t it <em>wild</em>?” giggles Lewandowski. “It is quite whirlwind, but it feels right, and we’re going with it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/04/ive-never-felt-so-close-to-anyone-this-quickly-the-whirlwind-romances-of-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

## How a small Spanish town became one of Europe's worst Covid-19 hotspots

<p>In the northern region of La Rioja, one medieval town has suffered a particularly deadly outbreak. And in such a tight-knit community, suspicion and recrimination can spread as fast as the virus. By Giles Tremlett</p><p>When we first spoke, in mid-April, María José Dueñas began weeping within seconds. Her parents’ home town, Santo Domingo de La Calzada, had the worst death rate from coronavirus in Spain, she told me on the phone. “I’m so scared,” she said. Dueñas told stories of police clambering through windows to rescue the dying, who were too weak to open their doors. Regional politicians, meanwhile, refused to give town-by-town figures for the dead, stoking anxiety and encouraging conspiracy theories. Santo Domingo’s locked-down residents, she claimed, were being deliberately kept in the dark as the virus silently stalked the town.</p><p>Dueñas does not live in Santo Domingo, a town of 6,300 people set among patchwork fields of cereal crops in the northern Spanish region of La Rioja. She was born there, but now lives 28 miles away in Logroño, the capital of this wealthy region, best known for the rich red wines that bear its name. Her angry, sometimes wildly conspiratorial outbursts on local Facebook groups – some of which have been deleted against her will – mean not all her old neighbours will welcome her back.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/spain-la-rioja-small-town-one-of-europes-worst-covid-19-hotspots">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A series of high-profile sporting events went ahead as scheduled in mid-March even as Covid-19 was being declared a pandemic. The Guardian’s David Conn investigates the scientific reasoning behind the decision, while Liverpool fan Simon Renoldi reflects on the loss of his father </p><p>In the hours before Liverpool faced Atlético Madrid at Anfield in a crucial Champions League match in March, the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic. But like other major events in Britain at the time, the government was content to let the match go ahead, allowing upwards of 50,000 people – many travelling from Madrid – to gather in close proximity. </p><p>One of those there that night was <strong>Simon Renoldi</strong>,<strong> </strong>who tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that days later he took to his bed with all the symptoms associated with Covid-19. Shortly afterwards, his father, who worked with him in the family pub, fell ill and died. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/04/from-anfield-to-cheltenham-did-major-events-cost-lives-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
