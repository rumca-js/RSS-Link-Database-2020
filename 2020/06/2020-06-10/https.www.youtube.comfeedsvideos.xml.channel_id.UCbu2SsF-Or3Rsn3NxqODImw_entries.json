We run down how to complete it successfully, as well as how to activate the public event's \"Heroic\" version for better rewards and some increased challenges. We also explain the new reward mechanic in the Season of Arrivals, the Umbral Engram. You'll find these Darkness-infused engrams throughout the game, but you can only decrypt them for loot at the Drifter. The Prismatic Recaster can allow you to \"focus\" those engrams to get yourself specific rewards, but you'll need to master the season's new currencies to do it.\n\nWe've got lots more Destiny 2 coverage for you to check out, exploring the game's future on next-gen consoles and its newly announced Beyond Light expansion in the fall.
