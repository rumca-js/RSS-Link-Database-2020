Linus tries a new Game Streaming app that offers refresh rates from 30, 60, 120, and even 144Hz! So we figured we'd try playing Valorant on an iPad Pro, and Doom Eternal on an Nvidia Shield with an Xbox One controller!

The iPad Pro talks a big talk, but can it REALLY replace a PC now that it has the Magic Keyboard and trackpad? We made an entire video with one to find out. (Linus says RILEY edited it, but due to time constraints, it was actually MARK who edited)
