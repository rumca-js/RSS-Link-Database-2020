<p>After three months of silence, Oliver Dowden must do more than issue vague reassurances</p><p>Twelve and a half weeks have passed since, on 16 March, Boris Johnson told Britons they must “avoid” theatres. For 12 of those weeks, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, has remained silent on the devastating consequences of the prime minister’s words on the cultural fabric of the UK. Lockdown was necessary. But so was rapidly forming a plan, along with colleagues in the devolved governments, on how to prevent the collapse of the infrastructure of the arts. And yet there has been no action, aside from the rushed pulling together of a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/culture-secretary-announces-cultural-renewal-taskforce" title="">cultural renewal “taskforce”</a> on 20 May.</p><p>Organisations across Britain, from the Globe and the Southbank Centre in London to the Hippodrome in Birmingham and the Royal Lyceum in Edinburgh, are warning that they may be forced to close. Sir Simon Rattle and Sir Mark Elder have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/10/orchestras-might-not-survive-after-coronavirus-pandemic-uk-conductors" title="">warned</a> of a devastated musical landscape and the potential loss of UK orchestras. The government’s furlough scheme and support for the self-employed have provided help for many organisations and individuals. But many have fallen through the cracks. In evidence given to the parliamentary select committee on culture this week, the Musicians’ Union told MPs that nearly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/09/majority-of-uk-theatres-and-music-venues-face-permanent-shutdown" title="">40% of musicians qualify for no support at all</a>.

<p>People have always reinterpreted and re-evaluated the past. Every time a statue comes down, we learn a little more</p><p>People are suddenly very concerned about the perils of rewriting history. We must be vigilant, apparently, to the possibility that great swaths of the past will be forgotten or, worse, “erased”. We must remain alert to the risk that our history will be “whitewashed” – as if there were enough whitewash in the world – with the difficult, complex bits disappeared. Meanwhile, unaware of all the controversy he has caused, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/10/bristol-mayor-marvin-rees-edward-colston-statue-slavery">Edward Colston’s statue</a> lies peacefully at the bottom of Bristol harbour.</p><p>Historians are not too worried at the threat posed by “rewriting history”. This is because rewriting history is our occupation, our professional endeavour. We are constantly engaged in a process of re-evaluating the past and reinterpreting stories that we thought we knew. Despite what Leopold von Ranke – one of the pioneers of modern historical research – said, history is not only about finding out “how it actually happened”, but also about how we think about the past and our relationship to it.

Da 5 Bloods is a paintball gun loaded with real bullets: a blast of satire and emotional agony about race and the American empire, the evergreen wound of Vietnam, African-American sacrifices on the field of battle, and the fact that black deaths matter.</p><p>It’s an outrageous action painting of a film, splattering moods, genres, ideas and archive clips all over the screen –&nbsp;with many a Brechtian-vaudeville alienation. It feels sometimes like an old-style war movie such as The Dirty Dozen but maybe Godard’s Le Petit Soldat, with playful riffs on Hollywood Vietnam standards and even John Huston’s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. The movie tricks you into thinking that it’s going to be a gentle, bittersweet picture about middle-aged guys with giant guts and prostates sadly coming to terms with their past, and the importance of letting go … and then it detonates a shock of fear and greed, which itself is always verging on action-movie melodrama and farce. It’s all so inventively bizarre that you could treat it simply as a black comedy, but in the final 15 minutes there is an amazing crescendo of emotion.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/10/da-5-bloods-review-spike-lee-delroy-lindo-vietnam-war">Continue reading...</a>

Where <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2019/aug/14/how-to-make-gazpacho-recipe">gazpacho </a>is bold and refreshing, ajo blanco is rich and winsome. The body of this garlic soup from Andalucia consists of almonds blended until smooth, and served ice-cold. I think the recipe works best if you freeze the almonds before blending, and I like to punch up the garlic by adding another clove. For some people, it’s a step too far to have a chilled soup, but I’m going to encourage you to ditch that protein shake after a workout and drink this by the glass.</p><p><em>Makes two glasses.</em></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/10/david-athertons-recipe-for-ajo-blanco-cold-soup-andalucian-classic">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The star of Nottingham Playhouse’s The Madness of George III, streamed for National Theatre at Home, talks about royalty, lockdown and theatre’s future</p><p><strong>This play is about King George III’s “madness”, but its cause is not entirely clear. Do you have your own theory about the source of his collapse?<br /></strong>The only thing that dates the play is a diagnosis of “porphyria”, which turns urine blue. That was the fashionable reasoning of the time. My feeling is that he had a massive mental breakdown: he had lost several children and he was one of those kings, like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jan/02/the-kings-speech-george-vi">George VI</a>, who was not really fitted to monarchy and might have been a farmer instead, but he had an enormous sense of duty.</p><p>I felt I could do something different with his condition and didn’t want to repeat what&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/feb/18/madness-king-george-alan-bennett-nigel-hawthorne">Nigel Hawthorne</a>&nbsp;had already done. There was so much strangeness to it and yet it was familiar in its mania. I had had an auntie who was a manic talker –&nbsp;she couldn’t bear any silence – and King George had talked for nine hours at a time. And having grown up opposite a mental institution and known a lot of the patients quite well, I based the physicality [in the performance] on them.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/10/mark-gatiss-on-madness-of-george-iii-nottingham-playhouse-national-theatre-stream">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The presenter-turned-screenwriter and the star of his new BBC show, Tom Brittney, discuss the reality TV drama and the impact fame can have on those thrust into the limelight<br /></p><p>Every true star of reality TV has a celebrated one liner. Nikki Grahame’s “Who is she?”, Gemma Collins’s “You ain’t ever gonna get this candy”, Lucy Watson’s “Why is everyone getting up in my grill?”. In Make Me Famous – the first TV show written by the presenter and documentarian Reggie Yates – Billy, played by Tom Brittney, knows that he has one chance to join that pantheon. When the producers of Love or Lust, the fictional reality show within the show, ask why they should pick him, a silent stare-off ensues. After an agonising pause, Brittney delivers the line – “I didn’t do anything for the last 10 seconds and you kept staring” – with such shameless, eye-rolling bravado that I slammed the pause button to purge my brain of the secondhand embarrassment. Call it a success.</p><p>Yates, whom I spoke to a few weeks later, is a busy man. He has spent all day watching footage of Pirates, his writing and directing debut feature. They were nine days short of wrapping before everything shut down because of the pandemic. “It’s a bit of a weird position to be in,” he chuckles. “It’s only in the last few years that projects I’ve created and written have started to get greenlit, which is very exciting.”&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/10/young-people-watch-reality-tv-it-has-an-effect-reggie-yates-on-make-me-famous-bbc">Continue reading...</a>

## Shopping for clothes is about to get weird – here’s how to make it simpler

<p>With shops in England due to reopen, customers can expect a very different experience. Do your research online first, buy before you try – and avoid jeans<br /></p><p>Picture the scene: you walk into your favourite clothes store for the first time in three months, check your mask is covering your nose and mouth, and pump sanitiser into your hands. And then you spot it – the perfect gingham dress. Just the mood-boosting, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/03/al-dressco-how-picnic-chic-became-the-look-of-the-summer">picnic-appropriate</a> fillip your wardrobe needs, and it is just there, on the other side of the shop floor. But, instead of making a beeline for it, you have to take the long way round, following the one-way system marked out in arrow stickers on the floor, pausing when the shopper in front of you does in order to observe the two-metre-rule (the pandemic-era grandmother’s footsteps that we have grown used to in the supermarket aisles). And then – disaster – the masked shopper in front of you reaches for your gingham dress and takes the last one in your size. Which means that, if she doesn’t buy it, it will be headed for quarantine in the stock room, rather than back to the shop floor.</p><p>From 15 June, clothes shops will be able to reopen in England, just a few days <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-52925516">after their counterparts in Northern Ireland</a>. The rest of the UK will eventually follow suit. Some people will have no interest in diving straight back into frenzied consumerism, what with the aforementioned frenzied consumerism being implicated in the rapid global spread of the coronavirus catastrophe. Some people will be constrained by financial circumstances. Some people may quite fancy a shopping trip just for a change of scene, but will still be trying to jigsaw together the jagged pieces of work and home-schooling children who are not back in the classroom.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/10/shopping-for-clothes-is-about-to-get-weird-heres-how-to-make-it-simpler">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The naturalist has always spoken his mind – and attracted death threats in the process. But Covid-19 has given him a new perspective on how humans can live in harmony with the natural world <br /></p><p>‘I’m tramping through damp, long grass in the wake of two poodles,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-packham">Chris Packham</a> tells me, over the phone, at nine in the morning, from his home near Southampton. “One of the joys of the UK is this rich, verdant colour at this time of year, so green that it’s almost blinding.” The naturalist’s voice, compelling and contemplative, draws you in and slows you down, to the point where you are concentrating hard enough to see what he describes, even when you can’t.</p><p>Generally, of course, you can see it: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/springwatch">Springwatch has been back on screens</a>, packed with the images – baby birds with their gaping maws, treecreepers blinking – we have always cherished and lately come to rely on. Packham, 59, has such a natural, contagious sincerity in his enthusiasm that he should be in the “national treasure” class, one of those rare figures who unites the country and is immune from politics. But he determinedly is not – he won’t, today, talk about grouse, hen harriers or any of those bird-cruelty issues that have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/may/14/a-of-crows-chris-packham-and-the-countryside-war-over-bird-killings">brought him death threats</a> of the most lurid kind (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/apr/25/dead-crows-left-at-chris-packhams-home-in-row-over-killing-pest-birds">dead birds hung up by his gatepost</a>, Twitter abuse too awful to detail). The BBC, I am given to understand, would prefer him not to speak on these topics. But in January he fell foul of the neutrality police in another way: while promoting his documentary about the global population, he said that, for the sake of the planet, people should consider having fewer children (he has no biological children).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/10/chris-packham-the-virus-has-taught-us-that-we-are-part-of-nature-not-above-it">Continue reading...</a>

## The Rees-Mogg conga: how has the pandemic changed parliament? – podcast

<p>MPs have been on a crash course in video conferencing in recent months as the pandemic meant access to parliament was severely restricted and remote voting was permitted for the first time. But with Jacob Rees-Mogg leading attempts to revert to in-person voting has the chance to permanently modernise been squandered?</p><p>When parliament was forced to suspend business in March, plans were quickly drawn up to resume work remotely through video conferencing and remote voting. Despite a few technical hitches, Labour’s <strong>Harriet Harman </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>how MPs quickly adapted to the new way of working. </p><p>But now, as lockdown eases, Jacob Rees-Mogg is leading the government’s efforts to end remote voting and return the ‘hybrid parliament’ to full attendance in person. The Guardian political correspondent <strong>Peter Walker </strong>explains why chaotic scenes of conga-style voting queues could become the norm if parliament cannot agree a quicker way to vote in person while maintaining 2-metre physical distancing rules. But for an institution so slow to reform itself, is it passing up a chance to properly modernise?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/10/the-rees-mogg-conga-how-has-the-pandemic-changed-parliament-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
