After a border confrontation in Arunachal Pradesh in 1986, India\u2019s then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, visited China in 1988 to thaw out a relationship that had been in deep freeze since the 1962 war. His visit led to a peace agreement signed in 1993 by his successor, Narasimha Rao, which made the LAC the basis for a stable and relatively peaceful status quo.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/23/india-china-border-modi-clash\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/23/india-china-border-modi-clash", "date_published": "2020-06-23 08:00:40+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Trafford Centre owner prepares contingency plan for administration", "description": "<p>Intu, which also owns Lakeside in Essex, has been unable to collect rent from many tenants</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/intu-properties\">Intu Properties</a>, one of Britain\u2019s largest shopping centre owners, has appointed the accountancy firm KPMG as administrator to make a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d if it cannot reach an agreement with its creditors.</p><p>The indebted company, which owns the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Lakeside in Essex, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/18/uk-shopping-centre-intu-debt-standstill-lockdown\">confirmed last month it was seeking debt standstill agreements</a> with some of its lenders as it battles for survival after a collapse in rental payments from retailers.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/23/trafford-centre-administration-intu-lakeside-rent\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/23/trafford-centre-administration-intu-lakeside-rent", "date_published": "2020-06-23 07:34:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "After the applause, it's time to rebuild global public services", "description": "<p>On Public Service Day, don\u2019t just thank all the workers combating Covid-19.

In Newark, New Jersey, the mood was tense: the city has a long history of police brutality. The 1967 uprising after the beating of a black taxi drivier resulted in the deaths of 26 people. But this time, there was no violence, no looting and not a single arrest was made. </p><p>The Guardian\u2019s <strong>Ankita Rao </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that this is a result of the recent reforms to policing in the city where the recruitment has taken place of a police force that better reflects Newark\u2019s demographics. Also community groups have become involved in patrols and citizen review boards oversee police use of force. It\u2019s ideas such as these that have gained traction in recent weeks behind the banner of \u2018defund the police\u2019 in many cities \u2013 although it is a phrase that Newark\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, is keen to downplay. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/23/rethinking-the-police-what-can-the-us-learn-from-newark-podcast\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/23/rethinking-the-police-what-can-the-us-learn-from-newark-podcast", "date_published": "2020-06-23 02:00:33+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
