Just a little over a year ago, in June 2019, rapper Nur-D (aka Matt Allen) performed for the first time in our studio. Nur-D didn't start out as the hip-hop artist he is today. In fact, he went from being a shy guy playing keyboard in a rock band to becoming the five-time Shut Up and Rap Champion in 2018. "I've always loved [hip-hop]," Nur-D says, "but I never thought it'd be something that I would do â€” mostly because I'm weird." Nur-D made it onto the 2018 Soundset Music Festival bill three months after starting his rap career in February of that year. In 2020, Nur-D continued to perform until the pandemic lockdowns. In May and June of this year, Allen gained noteworthy attention on the scene not for his musical vocation but rather as a medic taking part and assisting protesters during the demonstrations for justice following the killing of George Floyd.

June 23, 2020: As the music world confronts institutional racism and white supremacy, individual artists are wondering what steps they can take to establish a new, more equitable norm. Jeff Tweedy and Fiona Apple are sharing revenue, Patterson Hood is acknowledging "the bad name I gave my band," and the Beths are wondering about the responsibilities of white artists releasing new music.
