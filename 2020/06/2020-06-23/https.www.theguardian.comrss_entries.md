## Return to camping: The Quiet Site, Lake District

<p>Confirmation that campsites can open on 4 July has prompted a rush of bookings. For one award-winning eco holiday park in the Lake District, the phone hasn’t stopped ringing...</p><p>‘The phone started ringing even before he’d finished talking,” says Daniel Holder, referring to Tuesday’s announcement by Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/boris-johnson-ditches-2-metre-rule-in-england-for-1-metre-plus-coronavirus">that campsites and hotels are allowed to reopen on 4 July</a>. Four of the 12 people employed by Holder, managing director of The Quiet Site, an ultra-green holiday park in Ullswater, Cumbria, were poised to speak to people eager to book a stay at the site. At the same time, Holder was replying as fast as possible to a flood of emails. “We had 206 in the first hour.”</p><p>It doesn’t surprise me that people are so keen to visit. The Quiet Site is an exceptional place. In April it became the first holiday park in the country<a href="https://www.cumbriacrack.com/2020/04/22/record-number-of-winners-of-the-queens-award-for-enterprise-this-year-in-cumbria/"> to win a Queen’s Award for Enterprise</a>. And the campsite’s post-lockdown credentials are impeccable. With its Hobbit Holes, pods and generously-sized pitches spread out over the large site, social distancing should be easy. Its location on a rural hillside also means visitors are far from the pell-mell of urban life of any sort. And if the enforced isolation has left you starved of soul-easing views, you won’t even have to leave your tent to drink them in. I stayed there last autumn and even though my visit coincided with rather iffy weather, I still had a cracking time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/23/return-to-camping-the-quiet-site-lake-district">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From grand visions that fail with the departure of a president to everyday buildings knocked down before they can be considered for heritage protection, a new book unpicks what Egypt’s capital might have beenn </p><p>Looming above the affluent Zamalek neighbourhood in the centre of Cairo, the <a href="https://www.thenational.ae/uae/a-towering-reminder-of-egypt-s-corrupt-decades-1.399041">Forte Tower</a> has stood as the tallest building in Egypt for the last 30 years – yet it remains unfinished and abandoned. A ring of faintly Islamic pointed-arch windows encircles the uppermost floor of the great cylindrical shaft, creating a forlorn crown on the skyline, like a host awaiting party guests that never arrived.</p><p>Begun in the 1970s, the 166-metre tall building was planned to house a glamorous 450-room hotel, with restaurants, shops and a nightclub. It was to be the first part of a “new Manhattan of Egypt”, a cluster of skyscrapers imagined by president <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1981/oct/07/fromthearchive">Anwar Sadat </a>to rise from Gezira Island in the middle of the Nile, signalling Cairo’s place on the world stage. Following Sadat’s assassination in 1981, the project hit the rocks. Under subsequent president, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/hosni-mubarak-obituary">Hosni Mubarak</a>, the developer faced battles for permits and licences, seeing the project mired in lawsuits that ultimately halted it.

<p><strong>Available online<br /></strong>The gruff comic from Brooklyn appalls and entertains as he rages against the debauchery of modern America</p><p>Eddie Pepitone’s closest brush with UK fame came in 2012, when the incongruous story broke of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/aug/20/hugh-grant-turned-away-edinburgh-show">Hugh Grant being turned away from the New Yorker’s Edinburgh gig</a>. Whatever attracted the urbane English movie star to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/apr/13/eddie-pepitone-standup-comedian">the splenetic blue-collar Yank</a>? Well, Pepitone has a cult following, at least since documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZlZpN7TrZE">The Bitter Buddha</a> put on a pedestal his brand of barking self-disgust and rage at the debauchery of modern America. His new special unites those elements more satisfyingly than I’ve seen before, and finds the 61-year-old on sparkling – read: appalling – form.</p><p>Filmed at the Dynasty Typewriter in LA, For the Masses makes no bones about what we’re in for. “You’re not going to hear a lot of shit about dating and cargo pants and how fun everything is,” growls Pepitone. “It’s not fun!

<p>Their music may sound like the internet melting but the US duo have found a cult of fevered fans, including fellow pop futurist Charli XCX</p><p>For many US musicians, the height of ambition is winning a Grammy award. More ambitious performers might aim for an EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony). Bur, for the electronic duo <a href="https://www.100gecs.com/">100 Gecs</a>, only a PENOGT will suffice. “Pulitzer, Emmy, Nobel prize, Oscar, Grammy, Tony,” singer-instrumentalist Laura Les explains over video call. I haven’t heard that acronym before, I say. “We coined it, and it’s testament to our own ambition: there isn’t even a word for the shit we want.”</p><p>To those familiar with 100 Gecs, these aspirations might sound a tad inflated; some feel that the duo’s futuristic hyper-pop is too lo-fi, too entrenched in internet culture and unloved genres of the 90s and 00s (think chiptune, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendocore">Nintendocore</a>, German techno embarrassment <a href="https://scootertechno.com/">Scooter</a>), to be conceived of as anything but niche – so much so that the pair were accused, particularly at the start of their career, of being deliberately ironic, a postmodern inside gag. “It’s not a joke,” the band’s other half, producer Dylan Brady, reaffirms.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/23/were-not-doing-this-to-be-ironic-are-100-gecs-the-worlds-strangest-band">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Modi sells himself as a guardian of India. But a deadly clash with his most powerful neighbour shows his rhetoric has limits</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/19/india-accuses-china-of-preparing-attack-on-border-troops">Chinese assault on Indian troops near the Galwan Valley</a>, along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that serves as an unofficial international frontier between the two countries, is, for India’s political elite, a reminder of an awkward reality. India’s control over its border with China is contingent on China’s geopolitical priorities, not India’s own military capacity. This has been true for more than half a century. In 1962, 15 years into India’s life as an independent nation, a dispute over <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/24/aksai.chin/">Aksai Chin</a>, the north-eastern “ear” of Kashmir, led to a short war with Mao Zedong’s China and a humiliating defeat for India. China’s military edge along this huge disputed frontier has kept successive Indian governments on tenterhooks ever since.</p><p>Dealt a poor hand, India has played it reasonably well. The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/india-says-soldiers-killed-on-disputed-himalayan-border-with-china">20 military casualties</a> in the recent violence is its largest death toll in relation to China since 1967. Keeping the peace has involved some imaginative diplomacy. After a border confrontation in Arunachal Pradesh in 1986, India’s then prime minister, Rajiv Gandhi, visited China in 1988 to thaw out a relationship that had been in deep freeze since the 1962 war. His visit led to a peace agreement signed in 1993 by his successor, Narasimha Rao, which made the LAC the basis for a stable and relatively peaceful status quo.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/23/india-china-border-modi-clash">Continue reading...</a>

Different types of mask offer different levels of protection. Surgical grade N95 respirators offer the highest level of protection against Covid-19 infection, followed by surgical grade masks. However, these masks are costly, in limited supply, contribute to landfill waste and are uncomfortable to wear for long periods. So even countries that have required the public to wear face masks have generally suggested such masks should be reserved for health workers or those at particularly high risk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/coronavirus-what-kind-of-face-mask-gives-the-best-protection-against-covid-19">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Jonathan Watts continues his road trip in Hartlepool, where some see an opportunity to emerge from the past into a greener future<br /></p><p>Micky Day is an electrical cable installer from Hartlepool, one of the poorest, most avidly pro-Brexit regions in the UK. He is not interested in Westminster politics and has little time for talk of the green recovery, but he knows how to unite a community and care for people who are hurting. And it is this that inspires his thoughts about Britain beyond lockdown.</p><p>“We can’t have more cuts. There are a lot of people on their knees already,” he says. “There is a lot of industry in this area. If the government puts the money on the table, it could be massive in the north-east.

## I encouraged my wife to be dominant, but I’m worried it’s gone too far

<p>I haven’t managed to find a space where I, too, can have my sexual needs met. I’m not sure that being submissive is what I really want</p><p><strong>I am having a little trouble with my </strong><strong>marriage, sexually. While </strong><strong>I am quite kinky and highly sexual</strong><strong>, my wife is</strong><strong> not as comfortable with her sexuality, or communicating about it</strong><strong>. I accept that, and have been encouraging her to open up, feel pleasure and </strong><strong>tell me what she wants in the bedroom more. This has recently taken an unusual turn, in that </strong><strong>I have been encouraging her to role-play being dominant over me, with some success. This has led to a lot of massages for her</strong><strong> and very little oral sex for me! I think this is positive, but </strong><strong>I have</strong><strong> not managed to find a balance </strong><strong>or find a space where I am also able to express what I want and have my needs met</strong><strong>. I wonder if being submissive is what I truly want</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Your aim might have been to encourage her to adopt a classic BDSM dominant role, but she has interpreted it as permission to demand that her needs be met – and this is not a bad thing at all. Try to view this as it really is: an important stage in her sexual development – and yours. I am sure you know that BDSM is an advanced sexual style and that an awakening to power-exchange sex is a gradual process. Be patient. Encourage playfulness. Continue to allow her to order her pleasure from you. Very gradually, introduce the notion of switching (between dominance and submission). Besides giving you some respite, this should help her – and you – to better understand and enjoy the pleasures of fluidity, rather than rigidity, in polarised games.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/23/sexual-healing-wife-dominant-submissive-needs-met">Continue reading...</a>

You also know, if you’re conscientious, that you’re going to have to reread the thing. And that’s what swung it for me. I love rereading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/18/audiobooks.shopping">The Ascent of Rum Doodle</a>.</p><p>I dusted off my battered copy of WE Bowman’s classic, I shuffled the pages back into order, I sliced myself 400g of banana bread and I headed to my hammock.

<p>Fran Russell, former jails inspector, says the government is wrong to dismiss the Steiner movement to run state schools</p><p>A former HM prisons inspector might seem an unusual choice to head up Steiner schools, the liberal-minded movement whose aim is to provide “unhurried and creative” education. Fran Russell says in some ways she is surprised to find herself in the job. “I never imagined this is where I’d be,” she laughs. “But I feel compelled. I feel Steiner education has something important to contribute.” </p><p>Steiner schools have <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-28646118">attracted controversy</a> worldwide for many years, in particular around the “anthroposophy” of the movement’s founding father, Rudolf Steiner, the social reformer and clairvoyant, who died in 1925. Steiner himself had racist views – he espoused a hierarchy of races from “black to Aryan” – and at some UK schools there have been <a href="https://www.tes.com/news/bullying-and-racism-claims-secret-steiner-dossier-exposed">complaints about racism</a>.

<p>The promises of a new settlement for the UK have yet to materialise. Coronavirus makes that even more urgent</p><p>On this day in 2016, 72% of the UK’s electorate headed to the polls in the EU referendum. Four years on, one can hardly fail to be struck by the subsequent transformation of politics.

Settlers arrived in waves from Belfast, London, New York or further afield – from cities throughout Chile and South Africa. In this multicultural outpost, populated by residential tourists, we became wry observers of traditional nuances. For me, Ireland’s political, historical and cultural landscapes were first properly discovered in the country’s literature. The greats, such as Wilde, Yeats and Joyce, offered signposts to the past while more contemporary writers, including Roddy Doyle, Flann O’Brien and Jamie O’Neill, shone a light on lesser-heard Irish voices. And so my selection of novels echoes Ireland’s literary journey from pre-famine to the present day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/23/10-best-books-set-in-ireland-sally-rooney-edan-obrien-colm-toibin">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The New Jersey city had one of the worst reputations for police violence in the US, but as the Guardian’s Ankita Rao discovers, it is leading the charge for reform under a new mayor<br /></p><p>When protests erupted in cities across the US after the killing of George Floyd, police responded with aggression and in some cases teargas. In Newark, New Jersey, the mood was tense: the city has a long history of police brutality. The 1967 uprising after the beating of a black taxi drivier resulted in the deaths of 26 people. But this time, there was no violence, no looting and not a single arrest was made. </p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Ankita Rao </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that this is a result of the recent reforms to policing in the city where the recruitment has taken place of a police force that better reflects Newark’s demographics. Also community groups have become involved in patrols and citizen review boards oversee police use of force. It’s ideas such as these that have gained traction in recent weeks behind the banner of ‘defund the police’ in many cities – although it is a phrase that Newark’s mayor, Ras Baraka, is keen to downplay. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/23/rethinking-the-police-what-can-the-us-learn-from-newark-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
