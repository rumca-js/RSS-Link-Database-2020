Nur-D didn't start out as the hip-hop artist he is today. In fact, he went from being a shy guy playing keyboard in a rock band to becoming the five-time Shut Up and Rap Champion in 2018. \"I've always loved [hip-hop],\" Nur-D says, \"but I never thought it'd be something that I would do \u2014 mostly because I'm weird.\" Nur-D made it onto the 2018 Soundset Music Festival bill three months after starting his rap career in February of that year. In 2020, Nur-D continued to perform until the pandemic lockdowns. In May and June of this year, Allen gained noteworthy attention on the scene not for his musical vocation but rather as a medic taking part and assisting protesters during the demonstrations for justice following the killing of George Floyd.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Take My Picture\"\n03:21 \"Nin10doh\"\n06:18 \"Black Wizard Wave\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nNUR-D (Matt Allen)\nDJ Hayes\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan, Helen Teague\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Andrea Swensson\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/06/10/nur-d-session\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBNZW30eATU", "date_published": "2020-06-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Sounds Like Home: MaLLy, Molly Maher, Ashley DuBose, Mayda, Bad Bad Hats, Mae Simpson, Lady Midnight", "description": "Sounds Like Home II: On June 24, 2020, The Current is hosting another round of Sounds Like Home for an afternoon of virtual performances celebrating Minnesota musicians.
