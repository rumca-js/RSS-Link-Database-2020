Most impressively though, Apple ended Mac OS X and released macOS 11.0 Big Sur. Not only does this update bring the biggest visual upgrades (if you can call it that...) since Mavericks released in 2013, but it brings with it the announcement that the Mac will be moving to ARM. We'll talk about what Apple Silicon ARM Macs mean, when you'll be able to get one, the transitionary period, how things will work, and more.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0gwmrKIIow", "date_published": "2020-06-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
