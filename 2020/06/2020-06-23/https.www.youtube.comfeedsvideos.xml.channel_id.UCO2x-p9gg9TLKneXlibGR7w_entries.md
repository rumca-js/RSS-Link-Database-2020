In its annual WWDC conference, Apple did things a little differently: a pre-recorded Nintendo Direct style broadcast unveiling the all new iOS 14, iPadOS 14, watchOS 7, and macOS Big Sur. iOS 14 widgets were announced, an App Library (thanks Android) was implemented for the first time since 2007, and a bevy of other features like AirPods Pro surround sound, iPadOS scribble handwriting OCR gestures, and more made their way in. Most impressively though, Apple ended Mac OS X and released macOS 11.0 Big Sur. Not only does this update bring the biggest visual upgrades (if you can call it that...) since Mavericks released in 2013, but it brings with it the announcement that the Mac will be moving to ARM. We'll talk about what Apple Silicon ARM Macs mean, when you'll be able to get one, the transitionary period, how things will work, and more.
