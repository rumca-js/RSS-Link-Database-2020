## One Big Thing Assassin's Creed Valhalla Should Learn From Odyssey
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUaFM2PUxto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUaFM2PUxto)

The Assassin's Creed franchise is known for being very serious--but Odyssey was a refreshing change of pace with its boisterous and joyful humor. In a new video, Jess McDonell explains why she hopes the humor from Odyssey carries forward to the new Assassin's Creed game, Valhalla, which is releasing later this year. 

Be sure to watch the full video to see Jess explain why Valhalla should carry forward Odyssey's light and humorous tone, or at least retain some element of it. 

This would help vary the tone of Valhalla beyond the serious core narrative, just as it did in Odyssey, an important factor if we're to expect a world just as sprawling as Ubisoft's Ancient Greece, Jess says in the video.

Valhalla releases later this year on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, in addition to the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.
