Most of them also are misunderstood, or have preconceived notions attached to them, so I think it\u2019s time to take a look at the differences between the various packaging formats !\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\n\nFollow me on Twitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\n\nMy Gaming on Linux Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw_Lz7oifDb-PZCAcZ07kw\n\nFollow me on LBRY: https://lbry.tv/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\n\nThere are 2 main package formats here: the DEB and RPM. Debs are used by Debian and debian based distros like Ubuntu, and RPMs are used by Fedora, Red Hat, or OpenSUSE. Both of these formats are usually pulled straight from the distribution\u2019s repositories, or can be installed manually. They contain a binary version of the application or library you\u2019re trying to install, so it\u2019s already compiled for your system\u2019s architecture.\nThese packages come with a descriptive file that also includes all the various libraries and other applications your program needs to be able to run. \nThese DEB and RPM packages have advantages: they\u2019re fast to install, they\u2019re already compiled for your architecture, and they pull all your dependencies immediately if they\u2019re available. They do have problems though: first, since these packages are distro-specific, app developers need to package their app for multiple distros, multiple versions, and architectures of these distributions.\n\nTo fix these problems, the Flatpak format was created. This one differs from the packages in a very important way: while flatpaks are also shipped as binaries, so no compilation needed, they also embark all the libraries they need directly in the package. They can also used shared libraries provided in other flatpaks.\n\nFlatpaks are also relatively quick to install, and can be pulled from repositories called remotes. The biggest one out there is Flathub, which sources most available flatpak applications.\n\nFlatpaks also introduce some issues, mainly in terms of security: while flatpaks are sandboxed, they still can provide outdated versions of libraries that light or might not be kept up to date by the developer.\nThey also use up more space. Flatpaks can run on any distro that have the flatpak package installed, and can be downloaded from most distro\u2019s software centers if they have added the flathub remote.\n\nSnaps are based on the same model generally as flatpaks: they are binary applications shipped in a single package with their own dependencies. They can also make use of runtimes, and are sandboxed as well to avoid the snaps being able to see or read everything you have on your system.\n\nSnaps have an interesting difference though: they can also ship server stuff. While flatpaks are mainly geared towards graphical applications, snaps can contain pure command line packages. Another difference is that snaps can be updated while they are in use, and can receive delta updates. Snaps can also revert to the previous version easily.\n\nSnaps do have some problems though: first, they don\u2019t make use of the system theme. Second, they can\u2019t use external repositories: all snaps are shipped through snapcraft, which is the \u201cofficial\u201d distribution center for these.\n\nSnaps also tend to be bigger, and slower to launch than flatpaks or regular packages. Snaps can run on any distro that have access to snapd, the backend part of snaps.\n\nAppimages are yet another way to distribute applications in a single contained package. They use the \u201cone app one file\u201d method: an appimage ships all the files needed, and all the libraries as well, in a single file. They are not downloaded from a repo, but there is AppImage hub, a website that lists most if not all of the available Appimages.\n\nThese can just be downloaded manually and started immediately, wherever they are located on the system. No need to install runtimes, or shared components like Snaps or Flatpaks, you can just put your appimage anywhere and run it.\n\nThis means that appimages are super portable: to keep all your apps, you can just copy / past the appimages and you\u2019re good to go.\n\nThis a a big advantage, but there are some issues there as well: first, you can\u2019t update an appimage without downloading the new version yourself, so it\u2019s a bit like apps on windows.\nAppimages also don\u2019t respect the system\u2019s theme at all, and can get pretty big, since they don\u2019t make use of share runtimes at all. Appimages can run on any distro, they don\u2019t need any specific plumbing to work.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HuExVD56Bo", "date_published": "2020-06-23 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
