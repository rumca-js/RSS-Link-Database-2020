In a new video, Jess McDonell explains why she hopes the humor from Odyssey carries forward to the new Assassin's Creed game, Valhalla, which is releasing later this year. \n\nBe sure to watch the full video to see Jess explain why Valhalla should carry forward Odyssey's light and humorous tone, or at least retain some element of it. \n\nThis would help vary the tone of Valhalla beyond the serious core narrative, just as it did in Odyssey, an important factor if we're to expect a world just as sprawling as Ubisoft's Ancient Greece, Jess says in the video.\n\nValhalla releases later this year on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, in addition to the PS5 and Xbox Series X.
