It may not feel like that, but that is because the lockdown has widespread public support.

There was no justification for parliamentary accountability to be jettisoned. It is inconceivable that parliament, when passing the 1984 Act, would have conceived that the emergency procedure would be used repeatedly in order to avoid parliamentary accountability over the course of months.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster", "date_published": "2020-06-02 16:03:08+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Premiership rugby players cleared to start physically-distanced training", "description": "<ul><li>Premiership restart remains on course for late July</li><li>Clubs approve Myners report on salary-cap rules</li></ul><p>The cautious first steps towards a possible restart of the Premiership in late July have been approved with players now permitted to return to physically-distanced training.</p><p>There is no firm date for a resumption but clubs can begin to prepare for contact training in a fortnight or so.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/02/premiership-rugby-players-cleared-to-start-physically-distanced-training\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/02/premiership-rugby-players-cleared-to-start-physically-distanced-training", "date_published": "2020-06-02 16:00:14+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Coronavirus live news: cases in Africa pass 150,000; Germany lifts travel warning for Europe", "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/global-report-south-korea-trials-qr-codes-for-covid-19-tracing\">Wuhan doctor who worked with whistlebower dies</a>; Abu Dhabi closes borders; Dr Fauci says he hasn\u2019t spoken to Trump in two weeks</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-live-news-dr-fauci-says-he-hasnt-spoken-to-trump-in-two-weeks-as-pakistanis-told-to-live-with-virus?page=with:block-5ed641538f087122eca540bd#block-5ed641538f087122eca540bd\">Germany lifts travel warning for Europe</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/china-withheld-data-coronavirus-world-health-organization-recordings-reveal\">China withheld data on coronavirus from WHO, recordings reveal</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/we-cant-relax-europeans-face-up-to-life-after-lockdown\">\u2018We can\u2019t relax\u2019: Europeans face up to life after lockdown</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-uk-live-news-updates-covid-19-quarantine-plans-mps-westminster\">UK coronavirus updates \u2013 live</a><br /></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a><br /></li></ul><p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-02T15:53:07.065Z\">4.53pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p><p>Shopping malls in <strong>Dubai</strong> will fully reopen for business on Wednesday, in the latest easing of coronavirus restrictions, the emirate\u2019s media office has announced, AFP reports. </p><p>The step makes the city-state the first in the Middle East to drop nearly all restrictions to combat the spread of the virus.

Send clear signals<br /></strong>Few things are as frustrating as when slow wifi turns you into a malfunctioning Dalek just as you make an insightful point to colleagues on a video call. Why does that keep happening? \u201cMicrowaves, underfloor heating controllers and gaming controllers create electromagnetic fields that interfere with your wifi signal,\u201d says Charlie McKenzie, technical adviser for Vodafone. One solution is to check the frequency that your router operates at. Most modern routers send out signals at 2.4GHz and 5GHz, but as the 2.4GHz frequency is used by lots of devices around the home there\u2019s intense competition for bandwidth. \u201cFor video calls, try changing to the higher frequency by going into the wifi settings on your browser and selecting 5GHz,\u201d advises McKenzie.&nbsp;</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/jun/02/working-from-your-garden-six-hacks-that-will-help-you-get-the-most-from-your-wifi\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/jun/02/working-from-your-garden-six-hacks-that-will-help-you-get-the-most-from-your-wifi", "date_published": "2020-06-02 14:49:28+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Raab calls for alliance to force China to step back over Hong Kong", "description": "<p>UK foreign secretary tells MPs Beijing must end its plans for a new national security law<br /></p><p>Britain has vowed to build an international alliance of democracies going beyond \u201cthe usual suspects\u201d to force China to step back from the brink over its plans for a new national security law in Hong Kong.</p><p>In a statement to MPs, the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, said that by threatening Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, China \u201cwas inexplicably putting at risk what has long been regarded as one of [its] economic jewels\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/02/raab-calls-for-alliance-to-force-china-to-step-back-over-hong-kong", "date_published": "2020-06-02 14:43:45+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Germany's Covid-19 spikes present fresh challenges as lockdown lifts", "description": "<p>Outbreaks after family parties in G\u00f6ttingen illustrate the problems of containing virus</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p> </p><p>Several gatherings of extended families in the north-western German city of G\u00f6ttingen two weekends ago have resulted in a local spike of the coronavirus, which authorities say has highlighted the need to stick to physical distancing rules.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/germany-covid-19-spikes-present-fresh-challenges-as-lockdown-lifts\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/germany-covid-19-spikes-present-fresh-challenges-as-lockdown-lifts", "date_published": "2020-06-02 14:37:30+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Americans vote in primaries amid Covid-19 and mass protests", "description": "<p>Seven states and the District of Columbia are holding elections Tuesday in the most widespread trial yet of whether it can be done safely</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/us-politics-live/latest\">George Floyd killing \u2013 latest US updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">See all our George Floyd coverage</a></li></ul><p>Seven states and Washington DC are holding primaries on Tuesday in the most <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/voting-by-mail-to-face-biggest-test-since-pandemic-started-11591003801\">widespread trial yet over </a>whether America can safely hold an election amid the pandemic and unrest as days of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/02/george-floyd-protests-violence-overnight-donald-trump-threat-army-live-updates\">protest over the police killings of African Americans</a> continues.</p><p>Election officials, who have been encouraging people to vote by mail, already faced an enormous challenge in providing access to voting while protecting public health against Covid-19.
