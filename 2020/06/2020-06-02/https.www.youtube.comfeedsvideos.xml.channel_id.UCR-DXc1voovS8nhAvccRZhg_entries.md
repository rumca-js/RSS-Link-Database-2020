Today's the day! The #D9Launch day, that is. I'm going to upgrade the Raspberry Pi Dramble website (https://www.pidramble.com), or maybe accidentally take it offline, LIVE on YouTube for all the world to see! I haven't spent any time prepping for this stream, so we'll learn the upgrade process together!

This live stream is part of the Drupal 9 launch day: #CelebrateDrupal #D9LaunchDay #Drupal9
