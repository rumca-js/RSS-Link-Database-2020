<p>As lockdown eases, meeting up with friends has become bewildering. Can you share food – or a hug? Scientists and etiquette experts weigh in</p><p>From this week the lockdown rules in England have relaxed – groups of up to six can meet in an outdoor space, so long as they stay two metres apart. Anyone who can’t work from home has already been told to go back to work – while avoiding public transport. The sceptics among us smell a rat – with the alert level the same and the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/30/england-risks-covid-19-surge-without-test-and-trace-safety-net-sage-boris-johnson">government’s five tests unmet</a>, track-and-trace not ready and a government desperate to deflect attention from its shortcomings – is this easing really for our benefit, or just a way to kick responsibility back on to the population?&nbsp;</p><p>However, rejecting the new guidelines altogether and maintaining your own, personal lockdown may not necessarily be the most socially responsible thing either. Prof Carl Heneghan, the director of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine in Oxford, says: “We can’t stay in lockdown for ever. It’s too easy to make this about one disease. You’ve got to look at the wide spectrum of health issues, the backlog of other [medical] appointments, the impact of more austerity on people’s lives, the closure of schools and the effect on educational attainment, which we know is linked to health outcomes.” We won’t understand the dynamics of transmission – we won’t even understand how effective lockdown has been – unless we start to come out of it. It would be stretching a point to say that it’s your duty to attend a small and socially distanced barbecue, but for the sake of a Co-op burger and some coleslaw, I’m prepared to stretch that point.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/02/dont-stand-so-close-to-me-the-new-rules-of-social-distancing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Rock’n’roll is equated with excess – but for many musicians, addiction to drugs or alcohol can stifle their art. Three of them explain how getting sober sent their creativity skyrocketing</p><p>My sobriety began with a jump, falling into murky water. That’s not a metaphor: swimming in the middle of nowhere in my native South Africa in 2012, I picked up a parasitic disease called bilharzia; my subsequent weakened immune system and a summer of binge-drinking led to a case of hepatitis. Both diseases required prolonged hospital stays and strict admonishments against drinking alcohol. My nightly drinking and smoking were replaced with green tea and rest.</p><p>Three months of rest on doctor’s orders turned into eight years and counting. I left my old self at the bottom of that river, along with my old career and a few drinking buddies. As I transitioned into the life of a full-time writer over those years, I wondered whether it was possible to have a dynamic creative life after you get sober: can an artist relish the routine instead of the riot? The image of the drunk, drugged rock’n’roll life has helped to normalise addiction, after all. Sobriety and creativity cast a complex picture that asks more questions the longer you stare at it. I spoke to three musicians at different stages of their sober journey about leaving drink and drugs behind.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/02/no-downside-johnny-marr-best-coast-and-jason-isbell-on-how-sobriety-improves-music">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How do you make audiences laugh in a town that hates show-offs and loves to hassle performers? Our writer gets some hot tips as she continues her comedy tour</p><p>In 2005, you could fit the whole Cardiff comedy scene into a small minibus, says comic <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/oct/26/elis-james-funniest-things">Elis James</a>: “I get very nostalgic about those early days. It was the pre-Live at the Apollo era so there was only a handful of comedians based in Cardiff and you could count the gigs in single digits.” Around that time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/apr/28/rhod-gilbert-review-g-live-guildford-comedy-humour-trauma-chauffeur">Rhod Gilbert</a> moved back to Wales. “Rhod took a great interest in the embryonic open-mic scene,” says James. “You’re used to doing horrific gigs in the back rooms of pubs. Then, because Rhod is the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/aug/26/barnardos-archives-reveal-early-lives-of-uks-first-fostered-children">Dr Barnardo</a> of Welsh comedy, suddenly you’re performing in a theatre in front of 1,000 people.”</p><p>Now, you’d need a fleet of minibuses for the comedians in Cardiff, but that mutual support remains. “It’s close-knit,” says Eleri Morgan, who has been doing standup in the city for three years. “There’s a sense of camaraderie.” Cardiff attracts people from all over Wales – <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/06/a-sense-of-place-carmarthen-comedy-standup">James is from Carmarthen</a>, Morgan from Aberystwyth – so audiences get a cross-section of Welsh humour. James, whose recent BBC TV series <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000c8fs">Funny Nation</a> tracked the history of comedy in Wales, noticed many comics adopt a “low-status” persona. “Wales is a country of small towns and villages,” he says. “Growing up, if you were seen as a show-off that was quite an insult.” Comedians play with this, Morgan says: “There’s a Welsh saying which roughly translated means, ‘He who seeks fame, let him die.’ You’re like, ‘I’m on stage, but I’m a piece of shit.’”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/02/wild-west-joking-around-cardiff-comedy-scene">Continue reading...</a>

Right now, it’s absolutely vital. It’s your office, your children’s teacher, your portal to friends and family. For the sake of your household’s sanity, you really cannot have it functioning at anything less than 100%. Fortunately, there are some little-known tips and tricks to help improve your wifi’s performance, and keep it quick and reliable. Here’s how you can get the best from your invisible friend ...</p><p><strong>1. Send clear signals<br /></strong>Few things are as frustrating as when slow wifi turns you into a malfunctioning Dalek just as you make an insightful point to colleagues on a video call. Why does that keep happening? “Microwaves, underfloor heating controllers and gaming controllers create electromagnetic fields that interfere with your wifi signal,” says Charlie McKenzie, technical adviser for Vodafone. One solution is to check the frequency that your router operates at. Most modern routers send out signals at 2.4GHz and 5GHz, but as the 2.4GHz frequency is used by lots of devices around the home there’s intense competition for bandwidth. “For video calls, try changing to the higher frequency by going into the wifi settings on your browser and selecting 5GHz,” advises McKenzie.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/keep-connected/2020/jun/02/working-from-your-garden-six-hacks-that-will-help-you-get-the-most-from-your-wifi">Continue reading...</a>

It’s not as important as life or love. I recently found that out the hard way. My relatively comfortable lockdown was blown apart when I started haemorrhaging and was taken to hospital. From lying on the bathroom floor covered in blood to losing consciousness in the operating theatre as PPE-wearing doctors injected me with ketamine, I can’t say I thought about art once. I just thought about my wife and daughter. As I woke in the intensive care unit what most struck me was the courage, kindness and skill of the NHS staff.</p><p>But this might not be the full picture. Images of art also swam into my mind. I’m not sure when this started. I think it may have been on the operating table, with the anaesthetist holding my hand as he explained why they needed to put a tube into my groin, that I started picturing the tender, nuanced forms of organs and tree-like branches of veins in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/31/leonardo-da-vinci-a-life-in-drawing-review-royal-collection-uk-museums">Leonardo da Vinci</a>’s anatomical drawings.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/02/virtual-gallery-viewing-tate-modern-mark-rothko-jonathan-jones-short-films-art">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s not just the pandemic, or the killing of George Floyd, or Trump – it’s centuries of oppression, like kindling to a fire<br /></p><p>Look at America today and you see a land defined by death. People are dying alone in hospital beds and bedrooms. They’re dying in the streets. They’re dying inside as the economy collapses around them and their hopes for tomorrow evaporate. They’re&nbsp;dying because they can’t breathe.&nbsp;</p><p>Try to explain it all – much less cope with it – and our powers fail us. The reasons are too numerous, the enemies too powerful. How does a nation deal, all at once, with a deadly pandemic which its government is incompetent to protect it from; with an economic collapse unlike anything in living memory – and perhaps anything in modern history; with an explosion of rage on the streets, the fire sparked by the murder of George Floyd and the kindling heaped generously on top by centuries – <em>centuries</em> – of white supremacy?&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/02/america-isnt-breaking-it-was-already-broken-and-these-are-just-the-symptoms">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Peter Jackson’s mammoth Tolkien adaptation seemed to be too humourless and chockful of pointless names to be worth the bother – but I hit my stride en route</p><p><br />One thing I’ve learned is that it’s unusual for a guy like me –who grew up lonely and uncool – to have never had a fantasy or sci-fi phase. I never played Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I never read a Harry Potter book. And no, I never got into Tolkien. When I was a kid, I always thought that stuff was for nerds, and I was determined not to be one. I still had a rich fantasy life, but it mostly involved girls and guitars. So I never read any of The Lord of the Rings books, and I never regretted it.</p><p>When the movies came around, I was in my early 20s, finishing college, and spending a lot of time in bars. I was still too cool for fantasy, even as these movies moved fantasy firmly into the mainstream by racking up a billion dollars in ticket sales and over a dozen Academy Awards. A decade or so later, I stopped pretending to be cool. I became a film critic. I probably should have gotten around to watching the trilogy by now just as a matter of due diligence, but they were always low on my ever-expanding list of films to catch up on. For all their success and influence, they haven’t lingered in the public consciousness very much. These films aren’t talked about in my circles, and having disliked much of director Peter Jackson’s subsequent work, I didn’t feel like I was missing out on much. They just weren’t for me, I told myself, and that was okay.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/02/ive-never-seen-the-lord-of-the-rings-peter-jackson">Continue reading...</a>

It was probably early morning when the car pulled up at a wooden fence, on which were carved the words “GRAY HILL, COMPTON”.

The Hundred is just the latest in a long line of initiatives intended to make it more likely, and it could be that sometime in the distant, murky future, the sport’s historians will write about it glowingly as a genuine attempt not just to make the game more popular and lucrative, but also in some way better. For now, though, they will just have to find something or someone else to praise, and in all of cricket’s rich history there have not been many people more committed to making the game more interesting than Bev/Beverley/BH (take your pick) Lyon, the former Gloucestershire captain and pioneer of freak declarations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/02/little-to-declare-how-bh-lyon-tried-to-pep-up-county-cricket">Continue reading...</a>

We hope and pray that no one else will be killed. But we also know that very little will change.

<p>The author and comedian on his lockdown viewing, including a Tiger King binge, and why today’s greatest screen creations are animated</p><p>Like many, I began lockdown by bingeing on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series">Tiger King</a>, which remains one of the most extraordinary pieces of TV I’ve ever seen – although I’ve become disenchanted with the, ahem, lionisation of it since, particularly the reflexive mass-hatred of the only significant woman in it. Nonetheless, it’s a hilariously disturbing portrait of just how wrong a self-enclosed world can go.</p><p>I haven’t watched many films. I saw <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/21/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-review-tarantino-dazzling-dicaprio-pitt">Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</a>, which felt from another era. By which I mean, not the 1960s but from when it was made, pre-coronavirus – Tarantino’s retro worldview may now itself be retro. I also watched the extraordinary 2015 documentary about North Korea, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/02/north-korea-under-the-sun-vitaly-mansky-film">Under the Sun</a>, by the Russian film-maker Vitaly Mansky [<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Under-English-Subtitled-Vitaly-Mansky/dp/B01LWLCK0J">now on Amazon Prime Video</a>]. The film’s power comes from simply letting the camera run between scenes, thus showing the way the state handlers cack-handedly try and manufacture those scenes. It is intensely slow, but hilarious and heartbreaking.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/02/lockdown-watch-david-baddiel-animation-bojack-horseman-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood">Continue reading...</a>

## In 1919, the state failed to protect black Americans. A century later, it's still failing | Carol Anderson

<p>There is something so wounded in American society that basic commitment to justice is not part of the operating code</p><p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC">Red Summer</a>.</p><p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings – a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href="https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth.

American singer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/donna-summer">Donna Summer</a>, alongside production and songwriting duo <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/giorgio-moroder">Giorgio Moroder</a> and Pete Bellotte, were responsible for the torrid single <a href="https://youtu.be/kt0ZUCAI6pc">Love to Love You Baby</a>. In technical terms, the track’s modernism can be heard in a heavily foregrounded 4/4 beat bolstered, metronomically, by rudimentary drum programming. But that isn’t what initially captured the imaginations of the disco cognoscenti.</p><p>During a coke-fuelled orgy at his LA mansion, the head of Casablanca records, Neil Bogart, took a break from the festivities to phone Bellotte in a state of high excitement saying that everyone was <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/people/donna-summer-i-feel-love-classic-tracks">“fucking to this track”</a> and demanding constant rewinds. He asked the trio to expand the song until it filled the side of an album, something that was relatively easy for them to do because of the rigid grid of drum machine beats. The resulting track, replete with 22 simulated orgasms (courtesy of the 12-inch version at least), earned Summer, a practising Christian and trained gospel singer, a BBC ban, a trans-Atlantic hit and a new record deal with Casablanca.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/02/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-4-donna-summer-i-feel-love">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I want to have sex two or three times a night and it forces my partners to ask for a break, which makes me feel rejected. What can I do?<br /></p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> am a 29-year-old </strong><strong>man. I spend too much time thinking about sex, masturbating</strong><strong> or having sex. I masturbate </strong><strong>three to five times a day</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>down from </strong><strong>seven to eight when I was younger</strong><strong>. Every time I start dating a new </strong><strong>woman, I move quickly to a pattern of having sex </strong><strong>two to three times a night, almost every night of the week. </strong><strong>Although </strong><strong>they like it initially, they often </strong><strong>ask for a break after the second or third week, with complaints of soreness or not being in the mood.&nbsp;After a while, I start feeling rejected and move to end the relationship.&nbsp;I</strong><strong> am a graduate student and sex and masturbation consume a large part of the time I allot for studying.&nbsp;I started masturbating when I was nine or </strong><strong>10;</strong><strong> I think this </strong><strong>may be part of the problem.</strong></p><p>Masturbating in childhood – even much younger than nine – is perfectly normal. You must be feeling a lot of guilt and despair about your situation. There are those who would cast it as a problem of morality and excess, but your problem is not something you can easily change. Nor is it even a sexual issue in the main; sex just happens to be the way you express a broader psychological problem related to the way your brain works. You have sex compulsively. A person who is unable to resist being drawn to obsessive or repetitive actions in ways that cause significant problems in their lives – in your case, seriously interfering with studying and relationships – should seek help from a good therapist. Compulsiveness and obsessiveness can be treated, but if left unchecked they can become worse. Get help now; you deserve relief from the destructive treadmill on which you find yourself.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/02/my-obsession-with-sex-ruins-all-my-relationships">Continue reading...</a>

Yet, only when I picked up my first Fernando Pessoa, my first José Saramago, did I get a flavour of the whims, wants and interior worlds of the Portuguese <em>povo </em>(people)<em>. </em>My selection hops between the old and new, the native-born and the outsider-looking-in. It’s by no means exhaustive, yet, as Lord Byron wrote in Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage, I hope it serves as a route to “pleasure in the pathless woods” of Portuguese (and Portugal-related) fiction.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/02/10-best-novels-set-in-portugal-saramago-monica-ali">Continue reading...</a>

## The power of crowds

<p>Even before the pandemic, mass gatherings were under threat from draconian laws and corporate seizure of public space. Yet history shows that the crowd always finds a way to return. By Dan Hancox</p><p>As lockdown loomed in March, I became obsessed with a football anthem for a team 400 miles away. I had read a news story about Edinburgh residents <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/edinburgh-residents-belt-out-sunshine-21712006" title="">singing</a> a Proclaimers song called Sunshine on Leith from their balconies. I didn’t know the song, and when I looked it up, I found a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeHkQYDoVJ0" title="">glorious video</a> of 26,000 Hibernian fans singing it in a sun-drenched Hampden Park, after a long-hoped-for Scottish Cup win in 2016. Both teams had left the pitch, and the Rangers’ half of the stadium was empty. It looked like a concert in which the fans were simultaneously the performer and the audience.</p><p>I was entranced. I watched it again, and again. The sight and sound of this collective joy was transcendent: tens of thousands of green-and-white scarves held aloft, everyone belting out the song at the tops of their lungs. When the crowd hits the chorus, the volume levels on the shaky smartphone video blow their limit, exploding into a delirious roar of noise. I thought of something that one of the leaders of the nationwide “<a href="https://www.tunelesschoir.com/" title="">Tuneless Choirs</a>” – specifically for people who can’t sing – once said: “If you get enough people singing together, with enough volume, it always sounds good.” Our individual failings are submerged; we become greater than the sum of our meagre parts. Anthems sung alone sound thin and absurd – think of the spectacle of a pop star bellowing the Star-Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl. Anthems need the warmth of harmony, or even the chafing of dissonance. They need the full sound of bodies brushing up against each other in pride, joy or righteousness.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/jun/02/the-power-of-crowds">Continue reading...</a>

It’s also very related to the forest.

<p>Health officials and even government scientists have warned against the easing of the coronavirus lockdown in England, saying it could lead to a surge in infections.

This is substantially higher than the usual estimate for influenza of about 1.4 to 2.0. The infection rate dropped incrementally with the series of recommendations that started on 12 March, but did not <a href="https://mrc-ide.github.io/covid19estimates/#/details/United_Kingdom">fall precipitously</a> until the full lockdown was announced 11 days later.</p><p>Those restrictions have meant the R0 now appears to be below 1.0 in the UK, and on Monday the government eased some of the lockdown rules, allowing people to meet outside in groups of up to six, outdoor markets and car showrooms to begin operating again, and schools to reopen. But is it actually safe? <strong>David Hunter</strong>, professor of epidemiology at the University of Oxford, talks to <strong>Rachel Humphreys</strong> about the risks involved in lifting lockdown too early. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/02/england-easing-out-of-lockdown-is-it-safe-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
