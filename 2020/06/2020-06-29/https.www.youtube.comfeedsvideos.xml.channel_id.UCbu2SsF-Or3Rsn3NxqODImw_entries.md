Ubisoft teases its own battle royale game, Hyper Scape, with a teaser website for a fictional tech company called Prisma Dimensions. The website details that more information on Hyper Scape is coming on July 2. It's reportedly launching for PC and consoles on July 12 with cross-play.

The Last Of Us Part II will not be getting story DLC, but an online mode is still on the way. Unlike the first game, which got the Left Behind story DLC, director and co-writer Neil Druckmann stated on a Kinda Funny podcast that the story for The Last Of Us Part II is finished. Lastly for today's Save State, Call Of Duty: Warzone is getting a big update that adds a 200 player mode, as well as new modes and gear.
