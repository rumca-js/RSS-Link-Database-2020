<p>Under presenters’ soft probing, PM shrugs off austerity and promises plenty more plenty<br /></p><p>Call it a win-win. That’s if your smart speakers hadn’t shunted you off to a station in Malawi. Times Radio was looking for a big name to kick off the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/29/times-radio-launches-with-boris-johnson-and-malawi-mix-up">first show of its first day broadcasting</a>, and interviews don’t come much bigger than the prime minister. And Boris Johnson was keen to drop a gentle reminder that Radio 4’s Today still was not forgiven for its lese-majesty, which was why he had not appeared on the programme for nearly two years.</p><p>So shortly after eight in the morning Boris made his return to the first news organisation to have sacked him for lying. Not that the intervening 20 years or so have done much for his casual relationship with the truth, as he began with a long waffle about how things were going to be simultaneously remarkably hard and incredibly easy. Mainly he would be building a lot of things that he wasn’t entirely sure how he was going to pay for.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/29/boris-johnson-bats-back-gentle-lobs-on-times-radios-tame-debut">Continue reading...</a>

In previous years, the reluctance of assorted top-flight and Championship sides to take the competition seriously resulted in reduced crowds at Cup ties. With the elimination of Norwich, Sheffield United, Newcastle and Leicester at the weekend, the only thing faintly resembling magic left in this year’s FA Cup is the manner in which all the fans have disappeared.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/29/duking-it-out-behind-the-closed-doors-of-the-enormo-dome-that-is-wembley">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The latest in our seres of writers highlighting under-seen films to stream is a recommendation for Kelly Reichardt’s lyrical debut</p><p>“It’s funny how a single day can drag while entire years go by in a flash,” sighs Cozy (Lisa Bowman), the narrator of Kelly Reichardt’s debut film River of Grass. Ain’t that the truth. It was made in 1994 but you might say Cozy is already in her own private lockdown. An unhappily married mother of two, she fills her baby’s bottle with Coca-Cola and spends long afternoons yearning for the day when some nice couple in a station wagon will arrive to take the children off her hands. One night, she absconds to a bar where she meets Lee (Larry Fessenden), a loner with a high forehead and wild tendrils of hair. They flee into the night together, climb a fence and splash around in a stranger’s swimming pool. When the homeowner finds them, Lee lets his gun do the talking, turning himself and Cozy into the Bonnie and Clyde of the Florida Everglades.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/26/2-days-in-paris-julie-delpy">My streaming gem: why you should watch 2 Days in Paris</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/29/river-of-grass-my-streaming-gem">Continue reading...</a>

They invited 17 film-makers from around the world to make short films during lockdown about the theme of lockdown.

<p>In a new weekly column answering crucial cultural questions, we explore the etiquette around pesky TV and film spoilers</p><p>Spoilers used to be so easy. First you watched something, then you discussed it with your friends, who were almost certainly watching at the same time, and then that was it. Now, though, it’s a minefield. Nobody watches anything at the same time, and everyone blurts their opinions on social media as soon as they’ve seen anything. It’s a free-for-all, and it’s untenable. This can only mean one thing: it is time to definitively locate the point when spoiling a film or TV show is OK.</p><p>Clearly, that isn’t before the thing has actually come out. Nevertheless, that hasn’t stopped an entire spoiler cottage industry from springing up in recent years. Some nefarious movie insider will post spoilers – sometimes the entire plot – of a film to Reddit, and these secrets are then disseminated online and into newspapers. Before you know it, everyone knows what happens in Infinity War and nobody has any fun watching it, all thanks to a mouthy berk on the internet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/29/how-long-is-an-acceptable-time-to-wait-before-discussing-spoilers-avengers-endgame">Continue reading...</a>

As well as seeking to block publication, the lawsuit is looking for potential damages and for a declaration that Mary has breached the confidentiality agreement she signed in 2001, relating to litigation over her grandfather Fred Trump’s will.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/29/trump-brother-robert-tries-again-to-block-nieces-tell-all-book-after-failed-attempt">Continue reading...</a>

For years, we’ve been told that rising with the birds is the secret of being productive, successful, and Getting Stuff Done. But having recently become an early waker myself, I can’t help but think we’ve got it all wrong.</p><p>You see, every morning at 6am, before the rest of my household is up, you’ll find me curled up in a chair in the garden doing nothing. Not listening to self-improvement podcasts, not getting fit, not planning how to become a person with a whole lot of zeros as my net worth, but doing <em>no-thing</em>.

<p>Lockdown opened one mum’s eyes to the unexpected rewards of buying from the butcher, the grocer and the hardware store owner</p><p>I now have the same milkman I had when I was 10 years old. He was the very milkman who made possible my final cup of tea the day I left home. Sure, there was a 17-year gap in our relationship – while I sought my not-much-of-a-fortune in London. But now I’m back. And writing him notes, washing his bottles and occasionally catching his early morning cart has been one of the strangest pleasures of coming home. It’s not just nostalgia; having a milkman has made me feel part of a community I didn’t even realise I’d missed.</p><p>In many ways, it might seem callous to talk about the silver linings of living through a pandemic. I have been lucky. Many others have not. And yet, it is human nature to look for respite and hope where we can. So I can say that since my family went into lockdown in March, six months after we moved here, it has been a pleasure to shop locally. I can’t drive and am avoiding public transport, so all my shopping now takes place within a few miles of my house. More than transactional, it has been my lifeline to the outside world, my only physical interaction with other people and a way to support those small businesses that we all say we want to survive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/hit-refresh/2020/jun/29/i-have-the-same-milkman-i-had-when-i-was-10-years-old-how-the-pandemic-taught-me-to-shop-like-my-grandparents">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Bruce James, 61, and Julia Piedra Gutierrez, 57, met in 1998 in Costa Rica, when he mistook her for a girl he had met at a party. They now live in Honolulu, but are currently separated by the coronavirus pandemic<br /></p><p>After 10 years working as a merchant seaman in the US, Bruce James left his job in 1997 to move to San Jose, Costa Rica. He held a party the year after in October to celebrate his newfound freedom. “I met a beautiful Dutch woman called Julia,” he says. “I had a girlfriend at the time, but she stood out.” Several weeks later, he and his girlfriend attended a concert. “I spotted the girl from the party again, so I went over to say hello.” He soon found out it was a case of mistaken identity.</p><p>Julia Piedra Gutierrez, who was from Costa Rica, was waiting for her date and had no idea who Bruce was. “I saw this American guy looking at me. He was wearing this horrible old leather jacket,” she laughs. “He called me by my name and I had to explain that he was mistaken. Then his girlfriend came over and also thought I was the Dutch Julia.” They laughed about the misunderstanding. “I was a single mum with a busy career, and I’d planned my first date in ages. When my date turned up, he brought his wife. Apparently, they were separating, but still friends. It was an absolute nightmare.” She admits she wishes she could have spent the night with the “badly dressed” American instead.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/29/how-we-met-he-was-wearing-a-horrible-old-jacket-and-mistook-me-for-someone-else">Continue reading...</a>

<p>How much water and salt to use? Drain the pasta well or leave it dripping? It depends on whether you’re making this double tomato sauce or this courgette-almond pesto </p><p>A few days after we bought our cooker, a book arrived in the post. The cooker was a secondhand Gasfire Cucina – identified by the man who came to service and fit it (a 40-minute job that cost twice the price of the cooker) as one of the last to be made entirely by hand before the factory was mechanised in the late 1960s. The book was <a href="https://www.italianways.com/sophia-loren-in-the-kitchen-with-love/">In The Kitchen With Love</a>, Sophia Loren’s first cookbook; a surprise gift from a woman called Cathy Whims, whom I’d met at a lunch.</p><p>A cooker and a cookbook: the two were already related. They were also both beautiful, singleminded, previously owned, smelled vaguely of well-done toast, and both special (one handmade, the other first-edition). Add to all that the proximity of their arrival and the fact that the book was first published the year I was born. Also, that Sophia, too, had a Gasfire cooker, larger than mine, with hub-cap-like vents and two ovens, and that features in three of the book’s eight colour plates so saturated with colour and flair, they seem to glow and throb. It is my habit to look for messages – in clouds, coincidences, song lyrics, the condensation on train windows – a habit that verges on superstition at times. But there was no doubting that there was significance in it all, and that Sophia, her chin resting in her hand, her elbow resting on a table heaped with vegetables and dry spaghetti threatening to slide off, was glowing and speaking directly to me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/29/rachel-roddys-eight-rules-of-pasta-plus-favourite-sauce-recipes">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In the first of a series on the best tennis players of the past 50 years, we look back at the German who became the sport’s only ‘golden slam’ winner<br /><br />• Who’s your choice? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/29/who-is-the-greatest-female-tennis-player-of-the-last-50-years">Have your say</a></p><p>The forehand. It had to be the forehand. With Steffi Graf one point away from the most golden piece of tennis history and Gabriela Sabatini’s second serve there to be hit, Graf took a few quick steps to her left to run around the ball, her footwork as graceful as ever, and took aim. Striking a crushing forehand that a stumbling Sabatini could only frame towards the Seoul stands, the 19-year-old added the 1988 Olympic title to the grand slams she had won that year at the Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and US Open. Arguably the greatest forehand any woman has ever possessed had secured the rarest of achievements. No player, male or female, had claimed the golden slam before or has since.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/jul/14/angelique-kerber-recalls-memories-of-hero-steffi-graf-after-wimbledon-win">Angelique Kerber recalls memories of hero Steffi Graf after Wimbledon win</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/29/the-greatest-steffi-graf-power-perfect-timing-personified-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Are seatless, stroll-through shows the future of theatre? Can one-way dancing save nightclubs? Could budding indie bands storm Wembley stadium? Scientists imagine the arts after Covid-19 </p><p>The day before museums began closing in Britain, I saw Aubrey Beardsley at the Tate and Titian at the National Gallery. It was a strange experience, the power of the art undercut by the unsettling feeling that something deadly could be among us. “Don’t come too close to me,” I found myself thinking, or: “I can’t believe you’re coughing in public.” I wondered if it was wrong of me to even be there. With the words “global health emergency” ringing in my ears, I resolved not to leave the house again for pleasure. Soon, there was no choice anyway.</p><p>Those thoughts have resurfaced now that lockdown is easing and arts institutions face enormous pressure to reopen – and keep visitors safe. “The virus has produced a great deal of anxiety,” says Gabriel Scally, honorary professor of public health at the University of Bristol. “Coming out of lockdown, there are bound to be people whose psychological problems – OCD or agoraphobia – will be exacerbated by this. We need to make sure people can enter venues with confidence.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/29/covid-19-easing-arts-museums-comedy-theatre-clubbing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With restaurants closed and less food discarded on UK streets, rats have had to find new places to feed. Luckily for them, people are eating more in their houses, flats and gardens …</p><p>Lockdown has been hard for rodents whose fortunes are tied to those of humans. When restaurants closed, and city streets and back alleys emptied of people and their waste, rats lost a plentiful supply of food. So they followed us home, foraging and breeding in our gardens, drains and household voids. They became more brazen and aggressive. And, when that wasn’t enough, they began to eat each other.</p><p>Cannibal rats are among the grimmest consequences of the upending of urban life. In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned of “unusual or aggressive” behaviour in rats, including the eating of rat pups.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/29/summer-of-the-cannibal-rats-hungry-aggressive-highly-fertile-and-coming-to-our-homes">Continue reading...</a>
