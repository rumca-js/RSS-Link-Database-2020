The absence of Photoshop, Indesign and others is felt by many professionals that just can\u2019t switch their whole workflow over to free and open source tools, but it\u2019s also the same problem for UX designers. Akira UX is a project that aims to fix that.\n\nSupport Akira on Liberapay: https://fr.liberapay.com/AkiraUX/\n\nSupport Akira on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/akiraux/posts\n\nSupport the channel on Patreon: \nhttps://www.patreon.com/thelinuxexperiment\n\nFollow me on Twitter : http://twitter.com/thelinuxEXP\n\nMy Gaming on Linux Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaw_Lz7oifDb-PZCAcZ07kw\n\nFollow me on LBRY: https://lbry.tv/@TheLinuxExperiment:e\n\n\nWhat is Akira ?\nAkira is a native Linux Design application. Its end goal is to bring a modern approach to UX and UI design, and offer a professional solution for Linux users. It is not released yet, so many faetures aren\u2019t implemented as of yet, and it needs to be compiled (which is super easy right now), but is shows so much promise that I wanted to showcase it.\n\nAkira is developed by a team of 3, led by Alessandro Castellani. It was initially started with a Kickstarter campaing in early 2019, that unfortunately failed to reach its goal, but still managed to get more than 16 000 dollars in pledges.\n\nThe team didn\u2019t abandon the project, and started working on it anyways, even though the rythm of development is slower than what they could have achieved had the campaign worked successfully.\n\nAkira is meant to look like an elementary OS app, but will be available for other Linux distributions. Now, the choice of the elementary OS GUI has been made first because the team felt that Qt wasn\u2019t really an open source toolkit, and second because in the Gtk world, the elementary OS Human Interface guidelines was the most refined at the time the team started working on Akira. the GNOME HIG wasn\u2019t fully fledged yet.\n\nAkira is fully open source, which is important, since Akira will need to create a lot of the tools and libraries it needs from the ground up, and other projects will be able to take advantage of them.\n\nWhat can it do ?\nAkira is still in its early stages, but can already create artboards, manage layers by locking them in place or hiding them.\n\nIt can also create shapes, although that\u2019s limited to rectangles and ellpises for now, and change their properties: the fill color, the corner radius, the position on the canvas, the rotation and the border color and thickness. Shapes can also be placed up or down relative to each other, and be mirrored.\n\nYou can also import images, and resize them. Akira supports a dark theme, multiple icon themes and styles, and you can also tweak the default properties for the new shapes you\u2019ll create.\n\nThat\u2019s basic stuff for now, and Akira can\u2019t really be used a fully fledged tool right now, but it shows a lot of promise!\n\nAkira also supports saving and loading, as well as exporting to a file format. It wants to do a lot more than that, though: they want to offer something comparable to Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD.\n\nWhat is it missing ?\nFor now, Akira can\u2019t really be used in production, since it\u2019s still in alpha. Many features are still missing, the first being a text tool. This might be a huge endeavor, as not even GIMP has a competent text tool that works well. The team might have to start this one from scratch, which will definitely take some time to achieve and might slow down the progress of the project.\n\nWhile you can create shapes, like rectangles or ellipses, there is no way to create a line, vector based paths, or even just draw freely with a pencil. You can\u2019t create color gradients for filling shapes yet, and drag and drop is not implemented yet for reordering the layers. Shapes don\u2019t support drop shadows, and you can\u2019t undo / redo, copy / paste, or select multiple objects at a time. There is also no snapping of shapes yet.\n\nThere are a ton of features that will be implemented as time goes by, and while the team is small, they have already accomplished a lot with that tool. I asked Alex which are the main areas they will focus on next, and these are the ability to drag and drop the layers to reorganize them between artboards, reworking the transformations for the shapes and images to fix some issues, and adding a click and drag solution to select multiple items at once.\n\nAfter that, they\u2019ll aim for a beta release, which is missing a few big features: they want to bring full SVG compatibility, the ability to version control files to be able to reset to an earlier version, more shape controls, like gradients, textures, uneven radius. They were aiming at April for that release, but the world intervened, and with the current pandemic, Akira currently relies on the efforts of Alex alone, while the other developers deal with family and work", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjKC-Jyimc", "date_published": "2020-06-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
