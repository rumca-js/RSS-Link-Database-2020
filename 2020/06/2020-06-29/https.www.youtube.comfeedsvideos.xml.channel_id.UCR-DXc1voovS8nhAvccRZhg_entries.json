We'll also talk about thermal management and the importance of good benchmarks, and compare the Turing Pi to a more traditional Pi 4 cluster, as well as some other common types of computing instances!\n\nBlog post with links and more info: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/raspberry-pi-cluster-episode-5-benchmarking-turing-pi\n\nTuring Pi: https://turingpi.com\nTuring Pi Cluster open source project: https://github.com/geerlingguy/turing-pi-cluster\n\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:50 - Intro to Benchmarking\n02:08 - Making useful benchmarks\n03:53 - Turing Pi Disk performance\n06:46 - Disk vs Pi 4\n09:35 - Network performance\n10:45 - CPU Performance\n13:07 - Thermal measurements\n14:58 - Application benchmarks\n17:18 - vs AWS T3 and i9 laptop\n18:11 - Benchmarking conclusions\n18:52 - Outtro", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoMxpndlDWI", "date_published": "2020-06-29 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
