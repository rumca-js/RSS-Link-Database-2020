<p>This was an annihilation. From late summer into spring Klopp’s team seemed to be operating to a different set of physical laws to everyone else</p><p>No asterisks. No caveats. And let’s face it, no contest. For the last few months a theory has been doing the rounds that the ersatz nature of the Premier League endgame, five weeks of press-ganged summerghost-ball, would drain the colour from Liverpool’s first league title in 30 years.</p><p>Fat chance. Death, plague and economic collapse may have stalked the land, puncturing sport’s ability to pretend the rest of the world is simply a subplot. But sport has many functions beyond simply flag-waving and Liverpool’s success will be deeply felt at a club where, as with every other club, football has always been a bit more than just football.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/25/how-liverpool-became-premier-league-champions">Continue reading...</a>

She is the eldest of three sisters uneasily reunited for their mother’s funeral (the other two are Joanne Whalley and Victoria Hamilton). Walters is Teresa, a housewife devoted to her mother’s memory and very domineering when it comes to her husband, played by Tom Wilkinson.

The first item marks the 80th anniversary of the first deportation of Poles to Auschwitz in 1940. This is indeed a moment worthy of the most solemn remembrance. Too many people around the world forget that innocent and sometimes heroic Poles were the first prisoners in Auschwitz. But in the entire news item, lasting more than four minutes, the words ‘Jewish victims’ do not appear once. Instead, the head of the Institute of National Remembrance tells viewers: “That was the purpose of Auschwitz – that there would never be an independent Poland; to murder it.” No other groups of victims are mentioned until the footage of a memorial ceremony in Berlin, where the Polish ambassador to Germany says that from the moment of the creation of Auschwitz “we talk of the Holocaust”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/25/polish-populism-evening-news-public-broadcaster-presidential-election">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Algerian has dazzled for Brentford, having followed a familiar path through France’s lower divisions, and looks Premier League-bound</p><p>Be it with backheels, rainbow flicks or making the opposition look silly, few players outside the Premier League have made a bigger impression than Saïd Benrahma in the past couple of seasons. The Brentford winger boasts an endless box of tricks but he is more than just easy on the eye – he is approaching double figures in assists after equalling last season’s goal tally of 11 with eight Championship games to play. More often than not, his coup de grâce is sliding the ball through the legs of dazed defenders. “He could nutmeg a mermaid,” said Sam Saunders, the Brentford B assistant coach.</p><p>The buzz around Benrahma is growing and Friday’s game at home to West Bromwich Albion brings another opportunity to impress after he scored the opening goal in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/20/fulham-brentford-championship-match-report">victory </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/20/fulham-brentford-championship-match-report">at </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/20/fulham-brentford-championship-match-report">Fulham last weekend</a>.

<p>The TV director and actor talk candidly about how racism is draining, limiting and ingrained. But is leaving to work in the US the answer?</p><p>The director Christiana Ebohon-Green (EastEnders, Call the Midwife, Soon Gone: A Windrush Chronicle) and the actor Wunmi Mosaku, 33, (Luther, End of the F**king World and Misha Green’s upcoming HBO/Sky Atlantic drama series, Lovecraft Country) have met before. In fact, they have worked together, on Ebohon-Green’s Bafta-longlisted short, <a href="https://vimeo.com/208991896">Some Sweet Oblivious Antidote</a>. They both have fond memories of the sun-dappled shoot by the Thames, with a (mostly black) cast of actors. But not every experience on set has been so joyful. Amid some laughter, a few tears and many weary sighs, they swap horror stories of industry racism, discuss solidarity among black creatives, and the opportunities and risks involved in a move to the US.</p><p><strong>CE</strong><strong>G: </strong>I’ve worked on a lot of mainstream television drama, so I’ve often been the only [black person] on set. For me [having this wider conversation about racism] is a relief. Sometimes, you air issues and people are like: “Oh yeah, we know! We’ve solved that! Can you stop going on?” So I’ve been very careful about what I said and assumed people understood.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/25/christiana-ebohon-green-meets-wunmi-mosaku-its-exhausting-being-the-non-threatening-black-woman">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Argentinian goalkeeper has had years of loan spells and warming the bench but can stake a claim to be Arsenal’s No 1 after Bernd Leno’s injury<br /></p><p>Emiliano Martínez might reflect that, had it not been for a tumultuous afternoon in Stoke, the past five seasons could have turned out very differently. The Arsenal goalkeeper was 22 when, in November 2014, injuries to Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina afforded him his first crack at the top level. He was outstanding in a win over Borussia Dortmund before keeping clean sheets against West Brom and Southampton. Arsène Wenger was sufficiently impressed to decide that, if another three points followed at the then Britannia Stadium, the imposing youngster would keep his place despite Szczesny’s return. But Arsenal crumbled in familiar fashion and, while little blame could be attached to Martínez <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/06/stoke-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report" title="">in their 3-2 defeat</a>, Wenger reverted to what he knew.</p><p>Until <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/20/brighton-arsenal-premier-league-match-report" title="">last Saturday, when Bernd Leno’s injury</a> necessitated a 50-minute outing as a substitute, Martínez had made only made two further appearances in the Premier League. Now he has a chance to amass at least another eight, with Leno almost certainly sidelined for the rest of the campaign, and those who have worked with him during his decade in north London are adamant that he is no stopgap; Martínez, they say, has what it takes to become Arsenal’s long-term No 1.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/25/arsenals-emiliano-martinez-out-to-seize-rare-chance-with-both-hands">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A police raid on a gay bar in New York led to the birth of the Pride movement half a century ago – but the fight for LGBTQ+ rights goes back much further than that. By Huw Lemmey</p><p>In early July 1969, a US soldier stationed in Long Bình, Vietnam, opened his army newspaper and came across an article that would change his life. Among the stories of the ongoing war, specialist Henry Baird noticed an unusual headline. Over the past week in New York City, hundreds of homosexuals had fought police in a week-long riot in Greenwich Village, following a botched police raid on the Stonewall Inn, a mafia-run bar frequented by LGBTQ+ people. Years later, Baird would recount to a radio producer that his “heart was filled with joy. I thought about what I had read frequently, but I had no one to discuss it with. And secretly within myself I decided that when I came back stateside, if I should survive to come back stateside, I would come out as a gay person.”</p><p>Baird’s story is echoed in the accounts of thousands of LGBTQ+ people across the the world. After Stonewall, things could never go back to how they were before. While the Stonewall riots were a spontaneous eruption of anger against police harassment, they had been a long time in the making, and while the riots lasted only a few days, their repercussions continue to this day. Following this explosion of rage, LGBTQ+ people in New York and further afield transformed the small pre-existing gay rights movement. Soon they were advocating nothing less than “gay liberation”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/25/party-and-protest-lgbtq-radical-history-gay-liberation-stonewall-pride">Continue reading...</a>
