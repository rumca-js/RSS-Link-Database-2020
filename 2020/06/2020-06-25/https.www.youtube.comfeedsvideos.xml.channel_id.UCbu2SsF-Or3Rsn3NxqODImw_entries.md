On today's Save State, Persia talks about a few new details from the Night City Wire livestream that revealed more gameplay information and an anime called Cyberpunk Edgerunners. The anime will be coming to Netflix in 2022 and will be made by Studio Trigger. Edgerunners will be its own story within the Cyberpunk 2077 universe with new characters. 

Persia also talks about the Animal Crossing: New Horizons Summer update that will be available on July 3rd. We will now be able to swim and dive in to the ocean, find and donate underwater creatures, and meet some new friends like pirate Gulliver and Pascal the Red Sea Otter. There will be a 2nd Summer update coming in August. 

And finally, Persia goes over some specifics behind the games that will be optimized for Xbox Series X. Some titles that will be optimized are Assassin's Creed Valhalla, Halo Infinite, and Gears 5. Both next-gen and older games will be optimized which will further enhance backwards compatibility. 

And don't forget, this summer GameSpot is going to be hosting Play For All, a multi-week event that is going to be the best place for you to get all the latest gaming news, features, interviews, and live streams.

We finally went hands-on with one of the most anticipated games of the generation, Cyberpunk 2077, and in this video, Jake Dekker, Tamoor Hussain, and Edmond Tran describe their experiences with the opening hours of the game. Each of them built their characters as different from one another as they could, selecting divergent life paths and building up their stats and skillsets in unique ways.

This means that we saw all three of Cyberpunk's opening prologue sequences, which situate the protagonist, V, in different locations and set up different origin stories. We talk about how that affected our experience with the game, and describe what we got up to in our hours exploring the open world of Night City.

Cyberpunk 2077 releases on November 18 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game is also confirmed to be coming to Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, with a free upgrade for existing owners of the game for Xbox One and PS4.
