Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJune 26, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- The Jamaica-born, Miami-raised reggae artist BEAM is no stranger to the limelight. His father, Papa San, was a dancehall superstar during the late 1980s and early '90s before becoming a preacher. That combo meant BEAM developed musically and spiritually from an early age. Proudly reppin' a Broward County hoodie, the 23-year-old singer and his co-producer and keyboardist, Al Cres, brought a new flair to the Tiny Desk (home) concert series with some unorthodox visual effects. BEAM's light-hearted gravitas and charisma shine through from start to finish. \"MAD GAAL,\" featured on his 2019 major-label debut, 95, is sure to keep living room dancefloors bumping during the pandemic. He concluded the set with an exclusive: \"KUMBAYA\", a fitting song for this moment in history.\n\nSET LIST\n\"SOLDIER\"\n\"MAD GAAL\"\n\"STRANDED\n\"KUMBAYA\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAl Cres: keyboard\n\nCREDITS\nVideographer: BEAM; Audio Engineer: BEAM; Producer: Abby O'Neill; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz5Kgcjiasc", "date_published": "2020-06-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "M.

Ward would be the perfect artist to sit next to while he played his songs, perhaps on a couch in a small room. And that's pretty much what you get with this Tiny Desk (home) concert. We see M. Ward in the lounge of BOCCE, a recording studio in Vancouver, Wash. That tender wispy-rasp in his voice and flowing acoustic guitar make M. Ward a musician I'd want to hear up close. Matt Ward took song requests from fans for this concert, so we hear comforting and memorable older tunes like \"Poison Cup\" (2006) and \"Voice at the End of the Line\" (2003). Those songs fit so well with music on his new record, Migration Stories, from which he plays \"Coyote Mary's Traveling Show.\" The imagery and stories allow my mind to imagine, conjure, and wander. So shut that door, turn down the lights, and listen.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Instrumental Intro\"\n\"Duet for Guitars #3\"\n\"Chinese Translation\"\n\"Requiem\"\n\"Coyote Mary's Traveling Show\"\n\"Poison Cup\"\n\"A Voice at the End of the Line\"\nCREDITS\nAudio Engineer: John Morgan Askew; Producer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBzeyUvkmCE", "date_published": "2020-06-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Contest Top Shelf, Episode 3", "description": "On Thursday, June 25, Tiny Desk series creator Bob Boilen and Contest judge Raina Douris were live for the third episode of Tiny Desk Contest Top Shelf: a weekly livestream series featuring the best entries from the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest, supported by @statefarm.\n\nArtists featured in this episode include:\n- Deal Casino (@ _dealcasino_), \u201cJust A Cow\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtWXqV0urZs \n- Tia P.
