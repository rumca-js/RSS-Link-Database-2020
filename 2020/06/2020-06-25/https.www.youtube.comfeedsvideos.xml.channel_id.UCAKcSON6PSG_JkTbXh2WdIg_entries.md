Let's get the big question answered right away. "The name means 'airplane' in Thai," says Khruangbin's Laura Lee. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Khruangbin are frequently mislabeled as a Thai-funk band. The trio — comprising bassist Lee, along with guitarist Mark Speer and drummer Donald "DJ" Johnson — cite many influences, and they call Houston, Texas, home. On Friday, June 26, Khruangbin release their next album, "Mordecai." In honor of that, we're spotlighting these performances recorded by Khruangbin in our studio in 2018.

SONGS PERFORMED
00:00 "Maria Tambien"
03:09 "Lady and Man"

PERSONNEL
Laura Lee - bass
Mark Speer - guitar
Donald "DJ" Johnson - drums
