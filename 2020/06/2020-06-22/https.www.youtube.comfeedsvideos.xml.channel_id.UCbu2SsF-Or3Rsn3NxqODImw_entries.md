We chat with Toys For Bob's design producer Lou Studdert about the new Crash Bandicoot game, discussing the new art style, playing as Crash and Coco, and gameplay changes such as collecting masks that can bend time and gravity.

Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time is the first sequel to the Crash series in more than ten years. The latest game takes place a few years after Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped with some characters banned to the end of time and space. Players will take on the role of Crash or Coco to find four quantum masks in order to fix the universe. These masks allow players to manipulate levels through mechanics like time and gravity. The game expands the scope of levels, includes larger boss battles, and adds movement mechanics including wall-running, rail grinding, and rope swinging. Going between regular and retro mode will also change the way players collect lives. Crash Bandicoot 4: It’s About Time releases on October 9 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
