Learn how to get angrier at people you disagree with in this video. Instead of learning, listening, and understanding their different point of view, it’s best to get as angry as possible at them. This teaches them that they have no right to have a different opinion than you. With politics and social issues, we run the risk of becoming more united if we can’t find more ways to get even angrier at people. This video will teach you how.
