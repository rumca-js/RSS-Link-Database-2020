<p>The Covid-19 crisis has shown that we need to come together, not move apart. Sir Keir Starmer has an opportunity to seize and shape the political moment</p><p>To say that Labour has a mountain to climb after its calamitous defeat in 2019 is like saying Everest is a very steep hill. To win a majority of one at the next general election the opposition would need to increase its number of MPs by 123 seats, a 60% jump in its parliamentary strength and a feat no major party has ever achieved. The review of December’s election by the internal party group <a href="https://electionreview.labourtogether.uk/" title="">Labour Together</a> laid bare the extent of the loss, one that was a long time coming. It did not start – or end – with the party’s last leader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/key-points-from-review-of-2019-labour-election-defeat" title="">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p><p>Labour’s trials mirror the rise and fall of a particular electoral coalition between industrial workers and public-sector employees. This bloc began unravelling in the 2000s as <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/brexit/2016/11/23/globalisation-and-brexit-areas-that-voted-to-leave-were-most-affected-by-the-chinese-import-shock/" title="">globalisation</a> and technological change further reduced the size of the manufacturing sector. To compensate, Labour tried to appeal to younger, urban professionals with bold offers that in turn alienated many industrial workers. They either stopped voting or turned to other parties, notably on the right. Boris Johnson’s tilt to hard-Brexit populism in 2019, the review notes, gave 2 million of these previously lost “non-voters” a home and the Conservatives an election-winning base.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-labour-together-offer-britain-a-common-purpose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Today’s football pundit must drive engagement, stir debate and emotions – never mind nuance, ambiguity or ebb and flow</p><p>It’s thrilling, visceral television. The sort of raw, unbridled authenticity that makes Roy Keane one of the most compelling pundits not just in football, but in any sport. “I’m fuming here,” he says at half-time, with Tottenham 1-0 up against Manchester United and Keane sitting in the Sky Sports studio. And in those words lie a sort of mission statement, a definitive affirmation of an irrefutable truth: football is back, and how we’ve missed it.</p><p>No, that doesn’t really work. Let’s try it this way. It was unhinged, unsettling, shocking for all the wrong reasons. As he tore apart Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw, rounded on David de Gea for his failure to make a routine save, Keane again displayed the sort of indiscriminate rage that has made him one of the most toxic out-of-work coaches in the game. “I would be fighting him at half-time, swinging punches at that guy,” he spat, a sentiment that Sky seems perfectly happy to broadcast to a primetime family audience. The sooner this petty man with his unresolved anger issues is off our screens, the better.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jun/22/dont-look-back-in-anger-roy-keane-in-rant-mode-epitomises-modern-pundit">Continue reading...</a>

Now the company is reclaiming its stage</p><p>It was at the end of May that I heard live music for the first time in almost three months. Not over Zoom or YouTube. There were no cameras or wireless technology. It was old-fashioned and analogue, a group of musicians performing for an audience present in the same room. The concert marked the Bavarian State Opera’s first cautious steps at reopening. The Munich-based company, Germany’s largest opera house, was the first in the country to shut down in mid-March to help prevent the spread of Covid-19. In addition to losing a big chunk of its season, the company was also forced to cancel its summer opera festival.</p><p>But the music making never completely stopped. A series of weekly concerts featuring small groups of performers or soloists were livestreamed from the Staatsoper stage, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers around the world, and, in the wake of the first easing of restrictions on movement and social distancing in Bavaria, these Monday concerts have just been opened to 100 spectators. The final of the season at the end of the month will feature chamber works by Stravinsky, Strauss and Schoenberg conducted by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/kirill-petrenko">Kirill Petrenko</a>, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/jonas-kaufmann">Jonas Kaufmann</a> singing Mahler lieder.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/22/how-live-music-returned-to-munich-bavarian-state-opera-concerts-bayerische-staatsoper">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Former Leeds and Forest winger on life in the Turkish second tier, the ‘incredible atmosphere’ of playing for Gambia and how Steve Evans and Paul Ince shaped him</p><p>“Muz, you’ve got five minutes or you’re coming off,” would ring in the ears of Mustapha Carayol during his days at Crawley from the manager Steve Evans, who lambasted him each time the winger failed to beat the full-back. “You can imagine as an 18-year-old, you’re thinking: ‘Oh my God, I am going to get dragged off after 20 minutes.’ He gave me the tough love that I needed and made me the man I am today.”</p><p>Evans is a divisive character, a pantomime villain easier to loathe than love, but his management launched Carayol into a successful career, from his professional debut with Crawley in 2006.

<p>Those under 25 no longer want to be compared to millennials, and have been vocal about it on social media for some time<strong></strong></p><p>There may well have been a time when age was not considered a personality trait. But not any more – because if there is one thing that solidifies something as being real, it’s a new term. And there are terms aplenty when it comes to the generations that divide us: boomers, Gen X, Gen Y, millennials … and Gen Z.</p><p>But for those of us who have been condensing these brackets – viewing everyone over the age of 40 as a boomer and everyone under that age as a millennial – there may be a surprise for you coming: you are being offensive – at least to <em>real</em> young people (AKA Gen Z).</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/22/gen-z-hate-millennials-handy-guide-generation-wars">Continue reading...</a>

## Wellness is a seductive lie – and it is changing how we treat illness

<p>In desperate need of hydrotherapy, Abi Palmer went to a sanatorium – and found herself surrounded by luxury. How has health been sold as a lifestyle choice?</p><p>In 2017 I received an Arts Council England grant to complete research for my book Sanatorium<em>.</em> Writing a book was the only way I could think of funding a much-needed&nbsp;visit to a water-based physiotherapy rehabilitation programme, which was necessary to help symptoms caused by psoriatic arthritis and <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndromes/">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</a>. So I found myself in the sanatorium of my dreams: a thermal hydrotherapy centre on an island in the middle of the River Danube.&nbsp;</p><p>It was a cold October when I made it to the island. There were bridges to the mainland, but I am not able to walk reliably for more than a few metres, and if I use my mobility scooter in the cold, my legs seize up quickly and become incredibly painful. As a result, I was almost completely isolated at the sanatorium. I only left the strange, insulated building when my mental health was suffering so much that the risk to my body began to feel worth it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/22/wellness-is-a-seductive-lie-abi-palmer-sanatorium">Continue reading...</a>

## Fowl play: why colour-blind casting can also reinforce weary tropes

<p>Artemis Fowl on Disney+ is just one in a long line of films to change the race of supporting characters while preserving the ‘white hero’ trope</p><p>Mainstream family entertainment has made progress when it comes to representation of non-white people, and Disney+’s lavish new fantasy Artemis Fowl ticks a lot of the right boxes, at least on paper. But some conversations still need to be had. Especially when it comes to taking white-centric stories and simply swapping out a few supporting characters while preserving the white, usually male, leader at the centre.</p><p>Artemis Fowl is a sort of high-tech Harry Potter, adapted from the bestselling books by Irish author Eoin Colfer and directed by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a>. Its hero is a boy genius (newcomer Ferdia Shaw) with inherited wealth and a smug sense of superiority. Assisting Fowl on his adventure to find his missing father is his “friend, mentor and bodyguard” Domovoi Butler. In the books, Butler is a hulking Eurasian figure; in the movie, he’s played by Nonso Anozie, a British actor of Nigerian descent. Even with Anozie in white hair and blue contact lenses, it’s not a great look casting the guy whose family has served the white Fowl dynasty for generations as a black man. Meanwhile the more central character of Holly Short, who is described in the books as having “nut-brown skin”, is played by white actor Lara McDonell. Again, not a great look.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/22/why-colour-blind-casting-can-also-reinforce-weary-tropes-artemis-fowl">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From Churchill’s bombing of Iraq to the ‘war on terror’, a righteous self-image has always cloaked shameful self-interest</p><p>As the Black Lives Matter movement forces Britain to confront its imperial history, the shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/15/nandy-raises-question-over-foreign-office-racial-goetze-murals?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Gmail">highlighted a set of murals</a> on display in the Foreign Office (FCO). The murals depict, in the words of American historian Alexander Mirkovic, “the racial world” of the British empire, with the virile, heroic Anglo-Saxons lording it over their infantilised colonial subjects.</p><p>Nandy is understood to have asked the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, whether this is still the face Britain wants to present to visiting dignitaries. But as with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/lying-history-britain-statues-slave-trade">the current debate over historical statues</a>, what is really at stake here is not public relations or the causing of offence but the ways in which the imperial past shapes our persistently racist present. The FCO murals express a chauvinistic sense of collective self and a derogatory sense of others, which our political class has never really shaken off, and that still influences the dominant discourse around British foreign relations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/22/imperialist-murals-britian-foreign-office-legacy-dismantled-churchill-iraq">Continue reading...</a>

<p>K-pop fans have been able to put the online organisational tools they’ve honed for fandom projects to work on political activism</p><p>Over the past month or so, it’s been widely reported to much acclaim that K-pop fans are mobilising in social media spaces to help fight injustice. The majority of this was done thanks to K-pop fans’ savvy and long history of mobilising digitally to support their favourite stars, but that’s just the beginning.</p><p>For those not in the know, fans of South Korea’s pop music scene, aka K-pop, first went viral in recent days by engaging in a kind of vigilante activism, as fans across the world supported the Black Lives Matters movement.

<p>Creamy burrata with basil, grilled tahini chicken, plus a pistachio ricotta cake – summer dishes perfect to eat in the garden</p><p>As we slip from seemingly endless spring into summer, lunch and dinner outdoors has become an almost daily event. I’m happy with this and the change of step in the kitchen that accompanies it. Working at this new slower pace this week, I spooned a basil-leaf and green-pea dressing over a tender egg of burrata, and stirred coriander leaves into a crushed melon and raw tomato soup. The soup was taken outside and eaten in the shade. We poured a ribbon of olive oil into its chilled orange and scarlet depths. The little cooking I did was brief: asparagus cut into short lengths and fried with spring onions to make spidery, tangled fritters, and grilled chicken with a quickly made tahini dressing.</p><p>What links everything I have put on the table in the last few weeks is that it feels more at home outdoors than in. Even the cake I made felt like one for the garden. Its crumb freckled green with pistachios, the filling a barely set ricotta and orange cream. It was my favourite apricot sponge recipe, the fruit swapped for nuts, and we ate it as intended, before the filling had frozen, and then kept the rest in the freezer to scoff with our fingers like ice-cream wafers.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/22/nigel-slater-recipes-eat-outside-tahini-chicken-ricotta-cake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Leicester full-back on his experience of being racially abused and pushing for Champions League football with his club and a Euro spot for Portugal</p><p><br />”Yes, I think it was just once but I was young,” says Ricardo Pereira, taking a deep breath as he remembers being racially abused. “I was at Sporting but it was nothing very serious. I was a little bit shocked because I was young but it’s something that you learn to deal with.”</p><p>Now recognised as one of the Premier League’s best full-backs, the 26-year-old from Lisbon has come a long way since he was released by his boyhood club as a teenager. Ricardo was voted Leicester’s player of the season after signing from Nice in 2018 for €25m and had continued his swashbuckling displays into this campaign until he sustained an anterior cruciate ligament injury in the last Premier League match before lockdown.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/22/ricardo-pereira-people-should-have-respect-for-everyone-were-all-equal">Continue reading...</a>

But the gesture cannot distract us from the genuine work and significant change that still has to be done by the league and its clubs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jun/22/taking-a-knee-is-important-but-football-must-do-more-on-racial-equality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The theft of Palestinian land is a legacy of British colonialism. The UK must stand in the way of further Israeli annexations<br /></p><p>If ever there was a time to re-examine colonial legacies and responsibilities, this is it. The theft of Palestine from the Palestinians is one such legacy. On 2 November 1917, the foreign secretary, Arthur James Balfour, issued his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/01/arthur-balfour-declaration-100-years-of-suffering-britain-palestine-israel">famous declaration</a> in support of “a national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine.

This week: a yew in Wales</p><p>When Ieuan Morris, a film history lecturer, wandered through St Peter’s churchyard in Llanbedr-Ystrad-Yw, Powys, he stumbled across something that stopped him in his tracks – a chair placed inside a yew tree. “A lot of these old yew trees are hollow,” he says. “I did laugh out loud when I saw it because I just didn’t expect to see a chair inside. I wanted to sit inside immediately.”&nbsp;</p><p>Morris, 64, who is semi-retired and lives in Cardiff, has long been intrigued by yew trees and travelled to Llanbedr-Ystrad-Yw for<a href="https://www.ieuanmorris.com/coed-ywen-yew-trees#1"> his photo series</a> dedicated to them. “They are some of the oldest trees in Britain,” he says. “Some are thought to be 3,000 years old.

<p>With Italians holidaying at home post-lockdown but wary of busy hotspots, the country’s historic but often half-empty villages are emerging from the shadows</p><p>When Italy shuttered for the lockdown, the obscure village of Campli, in the central region of Abruzzo, got to work. Its mission was simple: to put itself on tourists’ maps.&nbsp;It is not short of attractions, with churches frescoed by students of Giotto and Raphael, acres of lush woodland and Abruzzo’s oldest Sagra della Porchetta, a traditional festival in which locals feast on succulent, slow-cooked pork. And when Italy reopened regional borders on 3 June, Campli was ready to cash in. “BorGO!”, a new package of initiatives, runs on Saturday evenings through June: the pedestrianised historic centre will be given over to restaurateurs; the cathedral and Santa Scala shrine will stay open until 11pm, and there will be free guided tours of landmarks such as the Palazzo Farnese, also until 11pm.</p><p>A similar story is unfolding up and down the country. Last month, Monteverde, a hilltop village of 770 people in Campania, revealed plans to attract longer-term visitors with a package including lodging in a brand-new hostel and free co-working facilities. Montefalco, an Umbrian town known for dense, full-bodies sagrantino wines, kicked off the tourist season with a village-wide&nbsp;alfresco&nbsp;lunch on 2 June. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/22/italy-deserted-villages-ideal-escape-pandemic-post-lockdown-distancing">Continue reading...</a>
