<p>The man who led the review into the Saracens salary cap scandal says the Premiership must work with players as the realities of post-coronavirus economics start to unfold</p><p>There are weeks – and this has been another one – when rugby union finds itself on a perilous tightrope. Over on the far side of the canyon is a potential land of plenty but one false move could have grisly consequences. With the realities of post-coronavirus economics also starting to unfold, the sport needs calm, rational counsel like never before.</p><p>Which is why the advice of a 72-year-old Cornishman with little previous connection to the pro game needs heeding. Prior to compiling his perceptive report into the Saracens salary cap affair, Paul Myners was City minister under Gordon Brown’s government. He is also a previous chairman of the Guardian Media Group and the Tate which, if nothing else, indicates an ability to look beyond the narrow horizons of corporate greed.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/lord-myners-premiership-players-strike-rugby-union-interview">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two identically-named sisters – each unknown to the other – are the stars of this sharp, touching comedy full of anguish, tears – and Soda Stream tea </p><p>It’s been three years since the pilot but The Other One has finally made it to our screens as a series. And it was worth the wait. The show is a comedy about the family Walcott, whose neat and ordered middle-class existence is thrown into uproar when its patriarch Colin dies and it is revealed he had a whole other family Walcott on the council estate across the way.</p><p>The first episode picks up where the pilot left off. Cathy is played by Ellie White – eternally Princess Beatrice from The Windsors, but with practice you become able to set that aside for half an hour. She and her mother Tess (Rebecca Front) are the “official” family, still reeling from the news of Colin’s 30-year betrayal. Cathy’s GP fiance Marcus (Amit Shah, perfect in a potentially unforgiving part) is still trying to make up for sending dick pics (“Just two! But one of them was on burst, so – 16”) to his receptionist.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/12/the-other-one-review-class-clash-comedy-puts-the-fizz-into-family-life">Continue reading...</a>

Extreme poverty is on the rise and underfunded health systems are woefully ill-prepared to cope with the virus. The number of children in Africa dying of preventable diseases is increasing. The gains made in development since the turn of the millennium are being reversed.</p><p>The international community is well aware of what’s happening. More than 100 countries have <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-imf-world-bank-imf-resources/imf-chief-economist-says-100-countries-seek-pandemic-aid-more-resources-may-be-needed-idUSKCN21W2UQ" title="">sought financial help</a> from the International Monetary Fund.

<p>Finding equipment that fits correctly has always been a problem for Greenway so she used the time in lockdown to create an online cricket store for women and girls</p><p>Lydia Greenway had big plans for this summer. Last September she was appointed head coach of the new Oval Invincibles women’s team in the Hundred, and right about now she was supposed to be busy getting the team ready for their first match on 24 July. That’s on top of her second job, <a href="https://cricketforgirls.com/" title="">running Cricket </a><a href="https://cricketforgirls.com/" title="">for Girls</a>, the schools coaching programme she set up in 2017. Then lockdown started, the schools shut, and the Hundred was postponed. And while the rest of us settled down to books and boxsets, Greenway got to thinking about a project that had been in the back of her mind for a while, if only she could find time: an online cricket store for women and girls.</p><p>Greenway had been reading <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/28/invisible-women-by-caroline-criado-perez-review" title="">Caroline Criado Perez’s book, Invisible Women</a>, which lays out what Perez calls the “one-size-fits-men approach” to design, the way in which, for instance, the average smartphone has been built to be too big for a woman’s hand. It was a problem Greenway knew about from cricket, where girls often have to play in kit designed for boys, in pads that are too wide, with straps that are too long and with bats that are too big, a problem that, she decided, it was finally time to try to fix for good. So Greenway, who describes herself as “a real technophobe”, started teaching herself how to build a website.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/12/cricket-lydia-greenway-they-might-seem-like-small-things-but-it-makes-a-big-difference">Continue reading...</a>

Not so today. Even before the coronavirus lockdown limited people’s trips to retailers in the flesh, online shopping was flying high. According to the <a href="https://www.worldretailcongress.com/__media/Global_ecommerce_Market_Ranking_2019_001.pdf" rel="nofollow">Global Ecommerce Market Ranking 2019</a>, the UK has the world’s fourth largest e-commerce market in revenue terms, and the third highest percentage of online shoppers, at almost 80%.

## Roderick Williams and Joseph Middleton review – expressive and nuanced

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall/BBC Radio 3</strong><br />This recital of ‘female’ songs made a convincing case for a rejection of gender divisions in the Lieder repertoire</p><p>‘Woman’s Hour”, the title that <a href="http://www.grovesartists.com/artist/roderick-williams/">Roderick Williams</a> had given to his lunchtime recital with the pianist <a href="https://josephmiddleton.com/">Joseph Middleton</a>, was only slightly tongue in cheek. It was an accurate enough description of the baritone’s recital, for Williams had put together a programme of songs by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/franz-schubert">Schubert</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/johannes-brahms">Brahms</a> and the Schumanns, all of which either had women as a protagonist, or were expressions of a woman’s viewpoint.</p><p>As he made clear in a brief explanation, Williams rejects gender divisions in the Lieder repertoire. He pointed out that the first performance of Schumann’s Frauenliebe und -leben, the cycle with which he ended, and which nowadays is usually thought of as a work for a woman’s voice, was given by a man, and he sees no reason why men should not sing it, any more than a woman should not tackle Dichterliebe or Winterreise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/12/roderick-williams-and-joseph-middleton-review-wigmore-hall-bbc-radio-3">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Questions over the response of the Poetry Foundation and the National Book Critics Circle to BLM protests have sparked a wave of resignations<br /></p><p>The US literary establishment is in turmoil after a wave of resignations from the Poetry Foundation and the National Book Critics Circle over their responses to Black Lives Matter protests.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/">Poetry Foundation</a>, established in 2003 after a multimillion dollar donation from the philanthropist Ruth Lilly, had been harshly criticised in a letter from almost 2,000 people, including the award-winning poet Ocean Vuong and many other writers, over its brief response to BLM on 3 June. The Poetry Foundation and Poetry magazine “stand in solidarity with the black community, and denounce injustice and systemic racism”, said the statement, and “as an organisation we recognise that there is much work to be done”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/12/us-books-world-rocked-by-racism-rows">Continue reading...</a>

## Is my husband’s affair linked to my childhood abuse? | Annalisa Barbieri

<p>Your trauma is not to blame for your husband’s infidelity, says Annalisa Barbieri. Therapy will help you focus on your own needs</p><p><strong>When I was 12, my 19-year-old cousin started to sexually abuse me, showing up at my house most afternoons</strong><strong>. I worshipped him, so I didn’t know how to say no.</strong> <strong>I do not remember how</strong><strong> or when it ended, but I know</strong> <strong>I </strong><strong>still feel the dread I felt when his motorcycle stopped in front of our house.</strong></p><p><strong>I met my husband when I was 17. </strong><strong>I was </strong><strong>terrified of sex, so we waited almost 10 years to make love. We had a child, who is now a young teen. Last week, 30 years after we met, I discovered that my husband had been cheating on me for a year. At this point, we hadn’t made love for a year.</strong><strong> I enjoy </strong><strong>sex to a degree, but</strong><strong> never feel the urge, even though I masturbate.</strong></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/12/is-husband-affair-linked-my-childhood-abuse-annalisa-barbieri">Continue reading...</a>

## PlayStation 5: the video games console is not dead yet

<p>As other video games companies move towards Netflix-style streaming and subscription services, Sony has doubled down on a new console. The company’s Simon Rutter explains what the PS5 brings to the table</p><p>Last night in a livestreamed broadcast, Sony showed its new video game console, the PlayStation 5, for the first time, along with 28 new games that will be out this year or next. It is a futuristic-looking thing, all white curves and black and blue-LED accents and a touch of mid-00s service robot about it. One version is digital-only, the other comes with a drive for people who prefer to buy games on disc.</p><p>As cloud-based and Netflix-like subscription services have gained traction in the video game world, the “end of the console” has become a popular conversation point. Two years ago at E3, the yearly video games conference, Microsoft’s Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jun/11/microsoft-e3-xbox-maker-suggest-streaming-will-replace-consoles">told the Guardian</a> that “we pivoted about three or four years ago to thinking about the gamer first, not the device first … Our focus is on bringing console quality games that you see on TV or PC to any device.” But Sony is doubling down not only on the idea of the games console, of generational technology shifts that make new kinds of games possible, and on the idea of selling a new box by funding games that can only be played on PlayStation 5.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jun/12/playstation-5-video-games-console-not-dead-ps5">Continue reading...</a>

This is the story of how its invention went on to change the world</p><p>“The best thing since sliced bread.” We’ve all heard the saying. It’s synonymous with greatness, a new invention, a game-changer. But the road to greatness is seldom easy.</p><p>Sliced bread was first sold in July 1928, in a bakery in Chillicothe, Missouri. The bakery used an automatic bread-slicing machine invented by jeweller Otto Rohwedder. It had been hard work to get to that point: Rohwedder had tried for some time to introduce the US to sliced bread. He’d carried out extensive market research, surveying tens of thousands of people on the perfect thickness of a slice. And his prototype machine and all his blueprints were lost to a fire in 1917.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/plug-into-hybrid/2020/jun/12/how-sliced-bread-became-the-best-thing-since-well-sliced-bread">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It was the reality show that changed British TV for ever. As its ‘greatest hits’ return to our screens, five contestants reflect on the highs and lows of life in and out of the Big Brother house</p><p>On 18 July 2000, 10 people entered a custom-built studio in a lot in east London. They were taking part in what was being billed as a unique “social experiment”: the opportunity to watch ordinary people on our screens, day-in, day-out.&nbsp;</p><p>No one could have known then the influence Big Brother would have on our viewing habits, or how it would birth the genre of reality TV in the UK. At the time, it was just another gameshow. But over the next 19 series – and 22 celebrity spin-off series – it redefined the nature of entertainment and modern celebrity. Thanks in part to the concomitant rise of tabloid magazines including Closer and Heat, with their endless appetite for celebrity gossip, the housemates, who entered the Big Brother house as nobodies, left as stars. In its heyday, Big Brother was a ratings goliath: the season three finale reached 10 million viewers. Housemates such as the late <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/09/jade-goody-scorned-celebrity-big-brother-britain-class-prejudice">Jade Goody</a> became cultural icons, while the likes of Alison Hammond and Brian Dowling became broadcasting mainstays in their own right.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/12/life-after-big-brother-e4-reality-tv">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Time-limited statues would acknowledge that history is as much a study of the present as the past<br /><br /></p><p>On Saturday, my wife and I went to join a short vigil for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd">George Floyd</a> on Tooting Bec common. It was a very orderly, socially distanced affair – so much so that standing near the back I couldn’t hear any of the speeches as there was no PA system. All I could do was take my lead from what others were doing. So I clapped when other people clapped and got down on one knee when everyone else did. This was something of a problem as I have a metal knee and I was in a lot of discomfort throughout – kneeling down is still painful even years after the operation – and my wife had to help me to get upright again. Other Black Lives Matter events weren’t quite so peaceful. Violence broke out in London, while in Bristol, the statue of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests">Edward Colston</a> was pulled off its plinth and rolled into the river. The statement on the protests in the Commons was a classic piece of parliamentary hypocrisy. Because while MPs on all sides were keen to condemn the civil disorder, everyone seemed secretly relieved that the statue had been removed. Certainly no one called for it to be reinstated. Bristol council has now decided that the statue’s final resting place should be in the local museum which feels like the right decision.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/12/could-edward-colston-statue-be-recast-as-social-reformer-frederick-douglass">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Make the most of outdoor eating with these veggie “sausage” rolls and a slightly boozy strawberry pavlova</p><p>Instead of zigzagging down to Portugal in our campervan this summer, we’ll be at home. Still, I intend to make it a summer to remember. I’m seeing the beauty of our parks and countryside with fresh eyes, and, thanks to the recent run of knockout weather, we have been eating most meals outside. This pavlova has been on our table a few times – it brings a lot of cheer – and the leek and mustard rolls have been packed for low-key family picnics. It’s going to be a British summer in every sense, and I am embracing it.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/12/anna-jones-summer-recipes-for-pavlova-and-vegetarian-picnic-rolls">Continue reading...</a>
