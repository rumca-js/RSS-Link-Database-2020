Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJuly 1, 2020 | Bob Boilen -- This week we're taking the Tiny Desk (home) concerts to places rarely visited; yesterday was Seoul, South Korea. Today we take you to Malawi in Southeastern Africa to meet Nelson Mulligo of the Malawi Mouse Boys. We see his two-room home in the opening shot where he and his family live without plumbing or electricity. Then we see Nelson, standing below the power lines, holding his homemade guitar singing, \"I'm So Tired of You.\" It's a song that sings out the evils of poverty, a life of hard physical work, of making money scavenging for mice amongst boars and snakes so they can sell them as roasted mice shish kabobs along the roadside. We only get one song, and even that cuts off abruptly, but I was deeply moved when producer Ian Brennan (Tinariwen, The Good Ones) sent it my way. He and his wife Marilena Umuhoza Delli met and recorded the Malawi Mouse Boys in 2011. You can hear Ian Brennan tell his story on NPR's Weekend Edition. If you fall in love with what you hear, give a listen to the entire band harmonize. You can find their music on Bandcamp here. Even though the group played Peter Gabriel's WOMAD festival in 2015, they still live in poverty. Support what you love.\n\nSET LIST\n\"I'm So Tired of You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nNelson Mulligo: guitar\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfyZ5U7PBKQ", "date_published": "2020-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Coreyah: Tiny Desk (Home) Concert", "description": "The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nBob Boilen | June 30, 2020\nThis week we'll publish four Tiny Desk (home) concerts from around the world. We begin in South Korea, where Tiny Desk Concerts are quite popular. In fact, I invited the Korean band SsingSsing to perform in 2017 and that Tiny Desk concert has been viewed more than 5 million times.\n\nToday, I bring you the music of Coreyah. According to the band, the name represents \"inheritance,\" and that's evident in the way this six-piece presents old or traditional Korean music with a modern twist. It's an uninhibited vision of Korean traditional music with some psychedelic rock, Balkan gypsy, even sounds from South America and Africa. You'll see and hear instruments including the daegeum, a large bamboo flute and geomungo, a large Korean zither that lays on the floor.\n\nWhen translated into Hangul, the Korean alphabet, Coreyah means \"whale,\" which is the group's good luck charm. The music was recorded in the band's music studio in Seoul, with COVID-19 shutting down most of the country. Strict social distancing is still ongoing in South Korea, though they are streaming their concerts to fans. \n\nAnd just a note from the band: The geomungo player in this video is Park Dawool, as Coreyah member Na Sunjin was forced to miss this recording due to a personal emergency.\n\nhttp://www.sori.nyc/coreyah\n\nSET LIST\n\"Till the Dawn\"\n\"Yellow Flower\"\n\"Good Dreams\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nHam Boyoung: vocals; Kim Dong Kun: daegeum, sogeum, tungso: Kim Cho Rong: percussion, chulhyungeum; Kyungyi: percussion; Ko Jaehyeon: guitar; Na Sunjin: geomungo\n\nCREDITS\nProducer: Bob Boilen; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZhAz6-Cgdg", "date_published": "2020-06-30 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
