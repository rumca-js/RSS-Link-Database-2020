The first time Barns Courtney performed in The Current studio, it was a solo visit in 2016. It was clear that Courtney's trajectory made him a powerful spokesperson for perseverance. A year-and-a-half earlier, he had been working in a computer store; by the time he played at The Current, Courtney was fielding emails from record labels and had even landed a placement of his single, "Fire," in the soundtrack of the Bradley Cooper film, Burnt. "It's both a blessing and a curse that for me, giving up was never really something I felt I could do," Courtney explains. "I think everybody's got that thing that's just so hard-wired into them that they can't stop, whatever happens."

Courtney said he'd always desired a career in music. "It was just something I wanted to pursue for as long as I can remember," he says. "I never really thought about, like, 'What if this was a career?' It was just one of those things where, 'This has to be what I do, because what else am I going to do?' I'm a terrible computer salesman!"

The next time Courtney visited us in studio was in September 2019; find the link to that session further below.

June 30, 2020: Changing their name to the Chicks, the band formerly known as the Dixie Chicks have declared that they want to 'meet this moment.' Is this the moment when country music finally faces a reckoning that will unseat the genre's longstanding racial exclusion?
