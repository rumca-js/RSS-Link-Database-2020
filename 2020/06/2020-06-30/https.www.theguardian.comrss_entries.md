Little kids from the school over the road used to peep in through the windows of Constantine’s house, trying to steal glimpses of their local cricket club’s new pro. They pointed at him in the street, asked him if he’d been working down a mine, whether he could wash it off with soap.</p><p>Hard as it was, Constantine decided that most of the racism he faced grew out of ignorance rather than spite.

<p>The heavy metal pioneers talk about drugs, groupies, pink Cadillacs, the curse of Motörhead’s Lemmy – and being huge in Sweden</p><p>It’s hard to fathom why Girlschool aren’t more celebrated. Forty years on from their first album, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/girlschool-demolition-album-of-the-week-club-review">Demolition</a> –&nbsp;released in June 1980 – and they are still the most successful all-female British rock band ever. They reached the Top 10 of both the singles and albums charts; they headlined the Reading festival in 1981; they filled Hammersmith Odeon; they appeared on Top of the Pops with two different singles –&nbsp;and they did so on their own terms. No svengali put them together; they never glammed themselves up to try to be sex symbols. They simply played raucous, high-energy rock’n’roll.</p><p>There had been all-female punk bands, such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/01/viv-albertine-i-know-now-that-i-want-to-stay-an-outsider-memoir-to-throw-away-unopened-slits-ari-up">the Slits</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/nov/05/the-raincoats-reform">the Raincoats</a>,&nbsp;and there had been women in – and leading – rock bands, but nothing quite like Girlschool. This summer, though, there will be no deluxe edition of Demolition. Unlike their near contemporaries in LA, <a href="https://www.discogs.com/artist/242611-The-Runaways">the Runaways</a>, there has been no <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/sep/09/the-runaways-review">starry biopic</a>, no acclaim for Girlschool as a landmark band. They still tour, still record, but their mark on history is far fainter than it should be.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/30/girlschool-heavy-metal-pioneers-drugs-groupies-lemmy-motorhead">Continue reading...</a>

They are not mere celebrities, but a part of your childhood, and if you grew up in the 80s and spent most of your time watching TV, as I did, then Timmy Mallett will occupy such a space. In the mid 80s, he was one of the team of presenters of Wide Awake Club, the Saturday-morning children’s show, although it is only Mallett, with his garish clothes and colourful glasses, that I can really remember. He quickly also became the face of the school-holiday show Wacaday.

<p>An ambitious project to chart the seabed by 2030 could help countries prepare for tsunamis, protect marine habitats and monitor deep-sea mining. But the challenge is unprecedented</p><p>On a wall facing Vicki Ferrini’s desk hangs a giant map of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. At 6ft by 8ft, it’s the largest size available on the printer at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, where she works as a geoinformatics researcher. “I of course want it even bigger,” she says.</p><p>The map is busier than a usual world map. Rather than showing featureless, flat blue ocean, here the seafloor bursts with detail: mountains, canyons, channels and plains that resemble the texture of land. Ferrini encourages her staff to print pictures of the seafloor features they’re researching and tack them to the map. One example off the coast of Argentina shows ripples in the seafloor reaching a hundred metres high. The map has a distinctly Sherlock Holmes-about-to-break-a-big-case look to it. “I’m trying to see the scale of the ocean,” she explains. “The big picture – but also the fine details.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/30/earths-final-frontier-the-global-race-to-map-the-entire-ocean-floor">Continue reading...</a>

I try to satisfy my partner regularly, but </strong><strong>often fantasise about other men being involved or my partner having sex with other men. I love my partner wholeheartedly and he is </strong><strong>extremely attractive, </strong><strong>amazingly attentive and understanding</strong><strong>, but I find that, as soon as someone has become familiar, I lose sexual interest</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Once I have “completed a conquest”, I want to move on. It creates tension in our relationship, as he feels undesired by me, which, in most respects, is not true</strong><strong>. I fear </strong><strong>it is related to the struggle I had when I was growing up</strong><strong> to accept that I was gay</strong><strong> – something I am long past</strong><strong>. </strong><strong>Maybe I just like being a cuckold.</strong><strong> Can you help me</strong><strong> to accept my sexual desire for my partner and give him the love he truly deserves?</strong></p><p>It is not unusual to have powerful fantasies that appear to threaten a relationship. The very forbidden nature of them makes them more exciting. Your fantasies are yours alone: you can choose when to indulge in them and when to set them aside; you can choose whether to share them with another person or to keep them to yourself. You seem to be afraid that you may not always have choices when it comes to acting them out or not, but you do. You can choose to make a fantasy real and potentially destroy your relationship, or you can relax and be at peace with your thrilling mind-erotica – and even use it to enhance your sex life with your partner. Your choice.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/30/i-love-my-partner-but-cant-stop-fantasising-about-other-men">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The ‘Cinderella in Sneakers’ battled with Martina Navratilova, endorsed everything from Rolex to cheese and helped drive the 1970s US tennis boom</p><ul><li>Who’s your choice? <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/29/who-is-the-greatest-female-tennis-player-of-the-last-50-years">Have your say</a></li></ul><p>The 1971 US Open was the first time the world glimpsed the power of Christine Marie Evert. She was 16, a prodigy who struck her backhand with two hands and had built her name that year with a junior and senior winning sequence across 45 matches. Clay was her surface of choice so the grass courts of the US Open seemed a challenge too far. Instead, she embarked on one of the sport’s most celebrated breakthroughs.</p><p>As she marched through the draw, three times recovering from a set down to reach the semi-finals, pandemonium reigned. Fans shook the Forest Hills stadium, cheering the errors of her foes and tossing beer cans into the sky. The press scrambled to find the perfect moniker so she was dubbed “Cinderella In Sneakers”, “Ice Princess” and “America’s Sweetheart” all in one breath. When she stood triple match-point down in the second round before mounting a miraculous recovery, little girls in the stands cried.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/30/the-greatest-chris-evert-us-revolutionary-who-helped-shape-modern-tennis">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain beyond lockdown: can we make more space for nature?

<p>The pandemic has highlighted the fragility of global supply chains and identified a need to redefine the role of food in the economy<br /></p><p>The first post-lockdown crops of the land army have been harvested. The food – chard, spinach, lettuce and radish – is being parcelled out to the local shops, market stalls and those in need. Now the volunteer labour force has its sights on a new goal: a land-use revolution that will make UK farming more nature friendly, plant-based and resilient to future shocks.</p><p>At Machynlleth, a bucolic town on the southern fringe of Snowdonia, the recently formed Planna Fwyd! (Plant Food!) movement is encouraging sheep farmers to diversify into vegetable production as their ancestors did. Teams of volunteers have sown crops of potatoes and, once or twice a week, they now fan across the slopes to tend gooseberry bushes, peas and squash. Others distribute seed packets to local families and run online classes on how to grow plants at home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/30/britain-beyond-lockdown-can-we-make-more-space-for-nature">Continue reading...</a>

In some ways it still is. But as an early adopter of western things, from ideas to clothes, it is easy to see Japan as a familiar place. Even its unfamiliarity – Shinto shrines, sumo bouts – is recognisable as “Japan” nowadays. What is less recognisable is what Japanese writers say about their own country. Authors – not the documentarists about families living with robots – uncover the mystery. These books speak for a Japan that is often spoken for and about, and speculated about by others; they speak for its history as it unfolded, for its culture as it is practised and its society as lived in and fought against.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/30/10-best-books-set-in-japan-murakami-murata-tokyo">Continue reading...</a>

But Paul Carroll knew better. The 59-year-old police trainer had seen the saucer-eyed teenage girls and lads swigging from cans of beer flooding into Daisy Nook country park, in Greater Manchester, as he took his dogs for a walk that evening. Carroll stared at the revellers in astonishment. Illegal raves simply do not happen in Daisy Nook.</p><p>It was not a restful evening. The traffic outside Carroll’s house was relentless, as was the whoosh<em> </em>of the nitrous oxide balloons the young people were huffing as they marched through the country park to the rave site, an empty field accessible from a canal path. Just after midnight, Carroll found a group of young men urinating on his garden wall. Insults were exchanged. “I wasn’t scared,” Carroll says. “I would have given as good as I’d got!” He backtracks. “Well, there were seven of them and I hadn’t got any shoes on.” After that encounter, Carroll’s wife told him to stop going outside. But he couldn’t sleep, so Carroll sat and watching the road, enraged. More cars. More balloons. <em>Whoosh. Whoosh.

<p>After years of outsourcing, many essential staff work for the NHS without receiving its benefits. In one London hospital, the fight is on for a better deal. By Sophie Elmhirst</p><p>On 9 February, a cold, damp Sunday, an Uber pulled up to University Hospital Lewisham in south-east London and dropped off a woman who had recently returned from China. The woman walked up to the reception desk and outlined her symptoms. She was given a mask, taken to a designated area outside the A&amp;E building and tested for coronavirus. When, three days later, the test came back positive, it confirmed what medical authorities had already suspected: this was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/13/london-coronavirus-patient-turned-up-hospital-uber-taxi" title="">London’s first case</a>.</p><p>That day, Ernesta Nat Cote, a cleaner at Lewisham hospital, heard the news from a nurse in her department. The nurses, Ernesta told me, are always the best source of information: “They tell me everything.” Ernesta has been cleaning the hospital for 11 years, ever since she first came to London. She arrives just before the start of her shift at 6.30am, clocks in and goes to clean the paediatric operating theatres, changing rooms and corridors. Over the years, she has come to know these rooms intimately: every corner, every surface, every tap.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/jun/30/hospital-cleaners-coronavirus-pandemic-nhs-outsourcing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>This Saturday, lockdown measures in England will ease further, with people able to get a pint in a pub, have a haircut and see another household indoors.
