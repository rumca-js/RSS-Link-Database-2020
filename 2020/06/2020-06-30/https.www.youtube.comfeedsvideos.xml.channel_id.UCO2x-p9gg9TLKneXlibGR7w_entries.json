Along with the transition to ARM came a bevy of visual changes (we won\u2019t call them upgrades, per se) and the announcement that Apple Silicon Macs would be able to run iOS apps without modification. Not only that, but that Apple would be placing all iPad and iPhone apps available to download in the Apple Silicon Mac App Store by default unless the developer specifically states that they don\u2019t want it listed. A bunch of multi-touch apps and games require touch input, however, and we\u2019re as sure as ever that touchscreen Macs are on the horizon despite Apple\u2019s insistence that they\u2019re not coming soon. We talk about visual indications we\u2019ve found hidden in macOS Big Sur that help argue why macOS Big Sur hidden secrets hint at a touch-capable future. #macOS #BigSur #SnazzyLabs", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXG5REBi2fo", "date_published": "2020-07-01 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
