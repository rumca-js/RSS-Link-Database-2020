CHAZ is the world\u2019s newest nation and was founded in the heart of Seattle by colonists who ripped away land from the local population. CHAZ was founded on very noble causes. But not so noble was the fact that the moment the nation was formed - a border wall was put up, border patrol guards, a monarch filled the power vacuum etc. \n\nThe root of every country and economy is the government. CHAZ, or CHOP, first identified as an \u201cAutonomous Zone\u201d.  They're modelling the idea of an \u201cAutonomous Zone\u201d coined by Hakim Bey. These autonomous zones can be used as a tactic by anarchists to sneak anarchy into formal society. Or it could be that these dissenters wanted a cool name and just power hungry. \n\nCHAZ is more of complete chaotic anarchy. Once CHAZ was formed, the Chazians found themselves with a new monarch - a war lord that declared his power, Raz Simone. But Raz isn\u2019t the only one that\u2019s power hungry in CHAZ, as there are other people challenging his rule, leaders trying to organize things in the background.\n\nYou know, what do they make, what are they known for, how does this economy make money? We\u2019ll just have to do an estimate. CHAZ strives to be an independent nation with a thriving agricultural industry. Other industries include street markets, bazaars, a very popular street art culture. And of course, you can\u2019t forget about the classic business of extorting local business owners for protection money. Stability is the name of the game. And CHAZ, has none! CHAZ\u2019s economy has one thing that no other nation in the world has - the complete, indisputable support from another gov\u2019t.\n\nAnother thing an economy needs is safety. Since CHAZ bans police, they had to build a very elite group of police, medics, and border patrol guards from scratch.  There\u2019s no pesky things like freedom of religion. \n\nAfter the recent shootings, the Major claims that they\u2019re gonna take back the police station. If you\u2019re the leaders of CHAZ and you don\u2019t control the violence, if you can\u2019t keep the image of just a peaceful protest - you will be crushed. CHAZ did the smart thing by changing its name from CHAZ, the Capital Hill Autonomous Zone, to CHOP, the Capital Hill \u201cOccupied Protest\u201d. \n\nBefore you start a revolution, make sure you have a detailed plan in place or else things will very quickly descend into chaos\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
