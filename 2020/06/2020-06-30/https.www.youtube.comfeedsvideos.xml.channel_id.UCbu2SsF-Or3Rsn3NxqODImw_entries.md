## Xbox Series X Could've Been Here In August | Save State

Persia talks about Microsoft's original plan to launch the Xbox Series X in August of this year. Of course, due to the pandemic and no E3, that launch date was delayed to the 2020 holiday season. This also means that the unannounced but heavily rumored Project Lockhart has also been delayed. It has been suggested that the official announcement will happen this August instead. 

Persia also talks about a recent discovery that you can pet the cats in Cyberpunk 2077. There is no word on the ability to pet the dogs, however. Considering the fact that Geralt couldn't pet cats in The Witcher, this is a small detail that feels like a big win for the cat-lovers out there. 

Lastly, during #PlayForAll, the voice actors of Arthur Morgan, Sadie Adler, and Dutch from Red Dead Redemption 2 joined Lucy James and shared some insight on content that didn't make it into the game. We already knew that about five hours worth of content that did not made it to the final game, but Roger Clark talked about a specific mission that he was sad to see let go. 

New to #PlayForAll? Play For All is multi-week summer gaming celebration and charity event featuring special guests and many familiar GameSpot faces. We've already raised thousands of dollars for #BlackLivesMatter and COVID-19 Relief Efforts thanks to all of you! Be sure to tune in every day between 12 PM and 2 PM PDT for interviews, livestreams, and everything in between.
