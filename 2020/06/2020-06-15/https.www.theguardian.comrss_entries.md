## Premier League restart preview No 17: Tottenham

<p>The situation was bleak before the break but Harry Kane’s return should give the side hope in a chase for a top-four finish</p><p><strong>What was the situation like when the league was suspended on 13 March? </strong>Bleak, with José Mourinho the first to say so. The manager had major injury concerns, with Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Moussa Sissoko and Steven Bergwijn each a long-term casualty. The squad looked tired and unbalanced, with Mourinho repeatedly bemoaning the fact that without Kane – who ruptured a hamstring tendon on 1 January – he had no senior No 9. The manager made no secret of his frustration at the failure to sign a new striker in the mid-season window. Unlike his predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino, he does not consider Son to be able to play at centre-forward. The team had rather ridden their luck at times – in the home wins over Manchester City and Southampton for instance, the latter in an FA Cup replay. After that game Mourinho said: “It’s very difficult to progress the way we want. Basically, it’s game to game, building a team with what we have.” Then the luck ran out. Spurs hit the shutdown on a sequence of six games without a win, a period when they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, and slipped to eighth in the Premier League.</p><p><strong>What about now? </strong>All change. From pessimism to optimism. The fitness situation has improved radically with the aforementioned quartet all ready to play, although there are now doubts over Giovani Lo Celso. Son even found the time to fit in his mandatory four-week basic soldiers’ training course in South Korea. Mourinho has had bonus weeks to work with his squad, making it like the pre-season he never had although, plainly, the Covid-19 protocols have meant that things have been different.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/16/premier-league-restart-preview-tottenham">Continue reading...</a>

## Reaction to the powerbroker behind Fury v Joshua is a mirror to boxing itself | Jonathan Liew

<p>Boxing has always been a flawed and dangerous game – the emergence of Daniel Kinahan is no betrayal of the sport</p><p>The footage is horrible, harrowing, traumatic. All the same, you can’t look away. The scene is the Regency hotel in Dublin in February 2016, the event a nondescript weigh-in before the big fight the following night. There’s terrible rock music playing. A couple of gormless-looking bald men standing on the podium bearing clipboards. A local cruiserweight called Gary Sweeney steps on to the scales in blue Superman briefs. The gormless bald men peer forward and write on their clipboards. Sweeney steps aside. All of a sudden, we hear the whip-crack of an assault rifle.</p><p>At which point, a lot of things happen at once. There’s breaking glass, chairs being overturned. We see a blurred Sweeney, still in his briefs, desperately fleeing for safety through a side door. Through the pop-pop of bullets and the din of grown men shouting, a single piercing child’s voice: “Daddy, what was that?” Within minutes the gunmen have departed, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/06/dublin-one-gang-fatal-shooting-woman">leaving one man dead and two wounded</a>. But the main target of the attack, according to Irish police, has already left the building. Daniel Kinahan will live to fight another day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/15/tyson-fury-daniel-kinahan-boxing-eternal-struggle">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The distinctive British response to the coronavirus pandemic is one of missed opportunities and dismal misjudgments</p><p>When the story of the coronavirus pandemic is written, the verdict on Boris Johnson’s government is likely to be damning. Mr Johnson has made mistake after mistake, for which the country has paid a very high price. The prime minister is right in a sense that he presides over a “world-beating” performance: with 64,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1270735561247133696" title="">excess deaths</a>, that is one excess death for every 1,000 people, the UK has recorded the largest global spike in deaths compared with the average yearly death toll; and the country will suffer the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/10/uk-economy-likely-to-suffer-worst-covid-19-damage-says-oecd" title="">deepest depression</a> of any developed economy.</p><p>Such a claim can be made because there’s no need to wait until all the facts are known. The gaffes are hiding in plain sight. Britain does not require the crisis to subside to analyse the country’s performance. The distinctive British response to this global challenge is one of missed opportunities and dismal misjudgments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/15/the-guardian-view-of-boris-johnsons-crisis-blunder-after-blunder">Continue reading...</a>

The fruit, which is native to Brazil, is a year-round crop in Australia, with seasonal peaks in both summer and winter.</p><p>You might find Panama, yellow or golden passionfruit in suburban backyards, but growers generally have a strong preference for purple varieties, since they were first introduced to Queensland in the late 1800s. Both kinds are delicious, but the purple fruits tend to be slightly richer and less acidic than yellow varieties. For green thumbs at home, expect roughly 18 months between planting your vine and harvesting the first fruit.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/16/going-gangbusters-when-winter-passionfruit-starts-to-blossom">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Queen and the fashions will be missing but even diehard racefans will be hoping normal service is resumed next year</p><p>It will not be long once ITV’s coverage of Royal Ascot is under way on Tuesday afternoon before someone who thinks that they are the “wit” in Twitter suggests that it’s much better without all the hats-and-frocks fluff that normally occupies the gaps between races. Five minutes, probably. Fifteen, tops. But a more sobering thought for the hardcore fans who care only about the horses and the racing is that if the need for a royal meeting behind closed doors is anything but a one-off, there may not be much of a racing industry at all this time next year.</p><p>It will look much the same to the hardcore fans if they switch on only for the races and return to their form study in between. The British Horseracing Authority and Ascot racecourse, meanwhile, deserve immense credit for getting the meeting on at all this year, never mind in its scheduled slot in the middle of June, just over a fortnight after the resumption of racing.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/15/fire-sale-royal-ascot-which-the-sport-desperately-needs-to-be-a-one-off-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Welsh critic’s 1960 novel Border Country is an intimate history of a working-class family, distanced by geographic and social mobility </p><p>For the last few years I’ve been attempting to write a book about the role of transport and mobility in society, only to find in the last three months that the biggest question of the day is not how we move around, but what we do when we’re forced to stay still.

It deals with migration, borders – both geographic and psychological – and the effects of industrial change on communal life. On first reading Border Country, I felt immediately bound up and connected with this story of a society powered not by crabby disaffection, but by love, deep connection and hope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/15/border-country-raymond-williams-book-changed-me">Continue reading...</a>

Emin once said her favourite artist is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2017/feb/08/vermeer-artist-who-taught-world-to-see-ordinary-beauty">Johannes Vermeer</a>. The new paintings in her online White Cube exhibition, entitled <a href="https://whitecube.viewingrooms.com/viewing-room/19-tracey-emin-i-thrive-on-solitude/">I Thrive on Solitude</a>, which has just launched, are domestic reveries in the tradition of Vermeer or, if you prefer a modernist comparison, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/26/pierre-bonnard-the-colour-of-memory-review-tate-modern-wife-marthe">Pierre Bonnard</a>.</p><p>The show’s title is self-explanatory. But in a Zoom event to launch it, she revealed to the 40 invited guests exactly how perversely inspiring she has found the coronavirus lockdown.

<p>From The Salisbury Poisonings to Sitting in Limbo, there’s a boom in real-life dramas.

<p>The P-Funk bassist was a street kid in the 60s, got his break with James Brown, then spent much of the 70s taking LSD. He talks about drugs, racism, police brutality – and the healing power of music<br /></p><p>At the age of 17, William “Bootsy” Collins packed up his homemade bass guitar and left home to tour the world with James Brown. He was heading off in pursuit of the funk. Or, as he calls it now – aged 68, in his high-pitched rasp down the phone from Cincinnati, Ohio – “the fonk”.&nbsp;</p><p>In the five decades since, Collins’s bass has changed the shape of music. Not only did he play on some of Brown’s best-known and most political records – Get Up (I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine, Superbad and Soul Power – but he has also had a hand in pop hits from Deee-Lite’s Groove Is in the Heart to Fatboy Slim’s Weapon of Choice and Snoop Dogg’s What’s My Name (Snoop Dogg). After working with Brown, he would discover LSD, join George Clinton’s Parliament-Funkadelic and help carry the torch for unapologetic bohemian black music after Jimi Hendrix’s death. He found his signature style – star-shaped sunglasses, skin-tight leathers and top hats – and became an icon of afrofuturism. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/15/bootsy-collins-were-all-funky-just-not-all-of-us-know-it">Continue reading...</a>

It can be a place to see the countless hundreds of people who worked to create something from nothing (not just the famous ones). Or it can just be an excuse to look for crew members with funny names. But the current trend with virtually all the streaming services is to treat end credits as having the same artistic merit as a DFS Summer Sofa Sale ad. Our entertainment goes from being a work of art that could resonate for years afterwards to “content” that is to be guzzled as fast as possible from an endless bargain bucket.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/15/the-end-of-credits-why-doesnt-netflix-want-us-to-watch-them">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The last days of lockdown and the early summer brings a gradual awakening to the trattoria of Rome, and the welcome return of a favourite dish of seasonal green beans</p><p>His hands on his hips, Andrea walked down the middle of the room, counting.&nbsp;It was the day before restaurants and <em>trattorie</em> could, if they adhered to a series of conditions, reopen in Rome. I happened to be walking by and noticed the metal shutters half rolled up, like sleepy eyes after two months of induced coma, so put my head round the door and shouted hello into the cavernous dimness. “That’s 72, 76, 82, plus the tables outside … 108 covers”, Andrea summed, before sitting at a table and signalling for me to join. No doubt he knows the number of covers as well as he knows the arches and velveteen seats of his father’s restaurant, the place he grew up in. He was counting in order to divide the number in two: removing half the tables and carving up the room with space is one of the regional conditions for reopening.</p><p>Like his father negotiating with the fishmonger, the vein in Andrea’s neck bulged as he told me of the failure of the furlough system and read me the rest of the conditions. Clean cloths for every table, hand sanitiser at the door and for wiping down plasticised menus, masks and gloves for staff, just masks for customers until the point of eating (at no point are they to be placed on the table), no coats on hooks, no shared condiments or jars of toothpicks, no unnecessary movements or proximity, or wandering children, or lingering near the door. The list, with the exception of the cloths, reads like a roll call against the nature of a Roman family restaurant; the antithesis of everything that makes them what they are. This, he summed, coupled with fear and the fact so many have so little money, meant no one would come.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/15/rachel-roddy-recipe-for-green-beans-in-cream-with-roast-chicken">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lockdown exposed the scale of the commercial baby business in Ukraine, and now women hired for their wombs are speaking out<br /></p><p>Some are crying in their cots; others are being cradled or bottle-fed by nannies. These newborns are not in the nursery of a maternity hospital, they are lined up side by side in two large reception rooms of the improbably named Hotel Venice on the outskirts of Kyiv, protected by outer walls and barbed wire.&nbsp;</p><p>They are the children of foreign couples born to Ukrainian surrogate mothers at the Kyiv-based BioTexCom Centre for Human Reproduction, the largest surrogacy clinic in the world. They’re stranded in the hotel because their biological parents have not been able to travel in or out of Ukraine since borders closed in March because of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/the-stranded-babies-of-kyiv-and-the-women-who-give-birth-for-money">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Andy Cowell runs the Fenn Bell Conservation Project in Medway, Kent. After 12 weeks of closure, as running costs mounted, zoos were suddenly told with less than a week’s notice that they could reopen on Monday to reduced visitors. But smaller zoos such as Fenn Bell have had to spend funds they barely had just to create space for visitors to visit safely, and Cowell is still a couple of weeks away from being ready. He tells Richard Sprenger why he is so angry at how the situation has been handled and fears the possibility of having to euthanise his animals&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/jun/15/you-cant-furlough-an-otter-why-one-family-run-zoo-remains-shut-video">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The veteran civil rights campaigner on growing up in segregated America, the opportunity of the Black Lives Matter movement and what inspires her to keep fighting<br /></p><p>It is 1972, and Angela Davis is answering a question about whether she approves of the use of violence by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/dec/05/how-hollywood-feted-the-black-power-movement-and-fell-foul-of-the-fbi">the Black Panthers</a>. She is sitting against a backdrop of powder-blue breeze blocks, the walls of a California state prison cell. Dressed in a red turtleneck, with her <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/oct/19/black-hair-why-its-time-to-stop-politicising-it">signature afro</a> and a lit cigarette, she stares at the Swedish interviewer – almost straight through him – as she delivers her reply: “You ask me whether I approve of violence? That just doesn’t make any sense at all. Whether I approve of guns? I grew up in Birmingham, Alabama. Some very, very good friends of mine were killed by bombs – bombs that were planted by racists. I remember, from the time I was very small, the sound of bombs exploding across the street and the house shaking … That’s why, when someone asks me about violence, I find it incredible because it means the person asking that question has absolutely no idea what black people have gone through and experienced in this country from the time the first black person was kidnapped from the shores of Africa.”</p><p>Watching the short clip explains Davis the icon in an instant: the image, the intent, the intellect. She was immortalised in the 2011 documentary<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/20/black-power-mixtape-film-review"> The Black Power Mixtape</a>, and clips of the interview have been shared on social media as the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer has triggered global protests against police violence. Her 1981 book, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/08/opinion/george-floyd-protests-race.html">Women, Race and Class</a>, is being shared widely as essential reading for anyone wanting to learn about being actively anti-racist, alongside James Baldwin’s The Fire Next Time and the autobiography of Frederick Douglass.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/15/angela-davis-on-george-floyd-as-long-as-the-violence-of-racism-remains-no-one-is-safe">Continue reading...</a>
