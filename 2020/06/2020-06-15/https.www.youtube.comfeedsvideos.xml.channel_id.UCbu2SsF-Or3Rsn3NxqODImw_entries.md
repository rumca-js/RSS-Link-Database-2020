EA has officially announced Star Wars: Squadrons. The new game from Motive Studios is an “immersive, first-person space dog fighting experience” that follows an original story with a new cast of characters, plus cameos from characters like Wedge Antilles and Hera Syndulla.

PlayStation 5 was announced last week, and we still have no idea what it's going to cost. PlayStation boss Jim Ryan said, however, that Sony is focused on "value opposed to price." Speaking of next gen, there's more details on Xbox Series X's Smart Delivery initiative. 

Here's how much we think the PlayStation 5 will cost: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-heres-how-much-we-think-sonys-latest-con/1100-6477901/

Here's a list of Xbox games with Smart Delivery: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-smart-delivery-games-features-detail/1100-6478490/

Fame is the key to victory in Humankind. Traditionally 4X strategy games have been won through military conquest, cultural growth, and scientific discovery among others.

But in Humankind all these historical deeds earn players Era Stars, allowing your culture to develop and grow. Fame will be awarded for every great deed a player accomplishes, culminating in a singular victory condition.

Humankind is releasing in 2021, although we do not have an exact release date yet. Until then we will be sure to bring you any news on the development of Amplitude Studios' next entry into the 4X genre.

## Fortnite - The Device Live Event (Gameplay)

After weeks of teases (and a couple of delays), Fortnite's Doomsday live event took place on June 15, setting the stage for the game's next season. If you were one of the many players not able to watch the event live due to capacity issues, however, don't worry; you can watch a full replay of it in the video above.

In true Fortnite fashion, The Device event led to some seismic changes to the game world. Shortly after the clock struck 2 PM ET / 11 AM PT, huge rods began to emerge from the water around The Agency before the device itself--a huge orb--rose out of the spy headquarters and above the map. The orb triggered a violent storm, which temporarily distorted reality and, ultimately, caused a massive tidal wave to surround the island.

The Agency was almost completely destroyed as the event transpired, leaving behind ruins in the center of the map. The tidal wave, meanwhile, has effectively replaced the storm circle, closing in on the island as matches progress and damaging any player caught in it. This all but confirms the rumors that Season 3 of the game will have a water theme.

Season 3 is set to begin on Wednesday, June 17, making this your last chance to complete any challenges you may have missed from this season. If you need some help cleaning up any remaining missions, you can find all of our maps and guides in our Fortnite Season 2 challenges roundup.
