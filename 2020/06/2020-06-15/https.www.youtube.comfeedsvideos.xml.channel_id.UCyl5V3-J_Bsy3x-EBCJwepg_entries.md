Today on The Babylon Bee Podcast, things get downright puritanical when Kyle and Ethan talk to Nate Pickowicz and Dustin Benge about their new book The American Puritans.

Dustin and Nate talk about the inspiration that they draw today from the lives of these men and women and their religious movement in church history while Kyle and Ethan try to figure out why someone would name their kid ‚ÄòIf-Christ-had-not-died-for-thee-thou-hadst-been-damned‚Äô and whether it‚Äôs true that Puritans invented tablecloths to cover up scandalous table legs.
