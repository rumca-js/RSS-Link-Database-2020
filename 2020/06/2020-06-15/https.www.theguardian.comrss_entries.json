The manager had major injury concerns, with Harry Kane, Son Heung-min, Moussa Sissoko and Steven Bergwijn each a long-term casualty. The squad looked tired and unbalanced, with Mourinho repeatedly bemoaning the fact that without Kane \u2013 who ruptured a hamstring tendon on 1 January \u2013 he had no senior No 9. The manager made no secret of his frustration at the failure to sign a new striker in the mid-season window. Unlike his predecessor, Mauricio Pochettino, he does not consider Son to be able to play at centre-forward. The team had rather ridden their luck at times \u2013 in the home wins over Manchester City and Southampton for instance, the latter in an FA Cup replay. After that game Mourinho said: \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to progress the way we want. Basically, it\u2019s game to game, building a team with what we have.\u201d Then the luck ran out. Spurs hit the shutdown on a sequence of six games without a win, a period when they were eliminated from the FA Cup and Champions League, and slipped to eighth in the Premier League.</p><p><strong>What about now? </strong>All change. From pessimism to optimism. The fitness situation has improved radically with the aforementioned quartet all ready to play, although there are now doubts over Giovani Lo Celso. Son even found the time to fit in his mandatory four-week basic soldiers\u2019 training course in South Korea. Mourinho has had bonus weeks to work with his squad, making it like the pre-season he never had although, plainly, the Covid-19 protocols have meant that things have been different.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/16/premier-league-restart-preview-tottenham\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/16/premier-league-restart-preview-tottenham", "date_published": "2020-06-15 23:01:26+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Four in 10 pupils have had little contact with teachers during lockdown", "description": "<p>Two separate studies raise fears that millions of children, particularly in state schools, have done almost no work at all<br /></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Four in 10 pupils in England are not in regular contact with their teachers, a study has found, amid mounting evidence of wide disparities in the provision of schoolwork during lockdown and fears that millions of children are doing little or nothing at all.</p><p>The report for the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER) also found that a third of pupils were not engaged with their lessons, fewer than half (42%) had bothered to return their work, and pupils in the most disadvantaged schools were the least likely to be engaged with remote learning.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/15/2m-children-in-uk-have-done-almost-no-school-work-in-lockdown\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/15/2m-children-in-uk-have-done-almost-no-school-work-in-lockdown", "date_published": "2020-06-15 22:53:52+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "College Behind Bars review \u2013 how education can unlock prisoners' potential", "description": "<p>This film following students of the Bard Prison Initiative is a tribute to their ambition and endeavour \u2013 and an indictment of the absence of funding for such programmes</p><p>It should not be strange to hear prisoners talk about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/22/blood-oresteia-aeschylus-tragedy-almeida-globe-home-theatre\">The Oresteia</a> or Moby-Dick or eukaryotic cell structure \u2013 but it is.
