This doesn\u2019t fix the issue that Microsoft ripped off someone else\u2019s work, but at least now they credit the original creator in WinGet. https://it.slashdot.org/story/20/06/01/1447201/microsoft-now-credits-maker-of-package-manager-it-copied----but-offers-no-apology\n\nEA follows up on promise to open source their command and conquer remastered collection, and opened up a github repository containing the source code for red Alert and TIberian Sun. https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/ea-open-sources-code-from-command-conquer-remastered-collection\n\nTotal War Troy was planned to release on Linux, but since it\u2019s now exclusive to the Epic Games Store for a year, the Linux version is on hold as well. ttps://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/total-war-saga-troy-epic-games-store-exclusive\n\nLenovo announced full Ubuntu and Red Hat support on their whole thinkstation and thinkpad series P line. https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2020/06/ubuntu-on-lenovo-laptops\n\nLinux Mint will block snaps from installing on their distro.

This is a complex one, since incognito mode was never pitched directly as a way to not be followed or tracked, but more as a way to avoid having all browsing data stored on your machine. https://www.androidcentral.com/google-hit-5-billion-lawsuit-tracking-chrome-users-incognito-mode\n\nCoreCTRL, an advanced app top control your AMD GPU has received an update to support the latest AMD Navi GPUs. https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/06/amd-wattman-like-open-source-app-corectrl-adds-navi-support\n\nProton 5.0-8 was released, with a host of performance improvements and bug fixes, especially for Doom Eternal, Streets of Rage 4, or Detroit Become human.\nhttps://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/wiki/Changelog\n\nWine 5.10 was also released.
