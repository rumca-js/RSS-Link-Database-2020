In this video, I show how, from a sequencers perspective, how I would use the 3p to make music.\n\nThis demo unit was provided by zzounds.com, who I'm partnering with for loaner gear to feature on the channel. They didn't pay me anything, but I have set up an affiliate program with them, so any videos featuring zzounds gear will have links that, if you buy something from them, will help my channel.
