Pokemon Sword & Shield: Isle of Armor gets a release date, along with some surprise Gigantamax forms and new items. Sega announces the Game Gear Micro, which is coming to Japan this October. It'll be released in four different colors, each with its own selection of games. Earlier this week, Sony delayed its PS5 event.

Before Valorant's June launch we got to talk with Riot executive producer Anna Donlon as part of GameSpot's Play For All charity event. 

We talked about how Valorant's developer plan to release future agents, following the pattern of games like Overwatch and Rainbow Six: Siege as well as the controversial anti-cheat tools that Valorant first released with and if we will ever see Valorant on the Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.

Valorant released as a free-to-play title on June 2, along with a new game mode Spike Rush and the new agent Reyna. We will be bringing you the latest news on Riot's free-to-play shooter whenever new content or seasons are released.
