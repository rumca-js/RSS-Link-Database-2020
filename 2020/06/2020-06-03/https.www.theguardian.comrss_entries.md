<p><strong>Wigmore Hall, London/BBC Radio 3<br /></strong>One of the youngest players in this month-long series of live recitals, the Scottish guitarist moved from Bach to Reich and Maxwell Davies with irresistible style and authority</p><p>At 28, guitarist&nbsp;<a href="https://seanshibe.com/">Sean Shibe</a> may be one of the youngest of this month’s Wigmore Hall recitalists, but the calm authority with which he delivered this lunchtime programme will have won him much admiration. His flair for pushing the repertoire boundaries for an instrument that has always had to beg and borrow was recognised in the 2018 Royal Philharmonic Society Young Artist award: his choices here underlined the breadth of his range and sympathies.</p><p>Born in Edinburgh to English and Japanese parents, Shibe considers himself Scottish, and beginning with seven of his own arrangements of pieces from 17th-century Scottish lute manuscripts was for him a badge of honour. The lamenting, lilting sequence was the ideal prelude to Bach’s Suite in E minor, BWV 996, originally for lute. From the cadenza-like flexibility of the opening Passagio flourish and its French dotted rhythms, Shibe’s sound was immediately arresting. Yet his seriousness of purpose could be heard in the rhythmic precision and clarity of the voice-leading in everything that followed, his colouring finely graduated throughout. The slow Sarabande had a deep expressivity, the Gigue nonchalant virtuosity.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/03/sean-shibe-review-guitarist-wigmore-hall">Continue reading...</a>

## 'She puts you into a dream': inside a thrilling film about Shirley Jackson

<p>Shirley, a film by Josephine Decker, transforms the life of the notorious horror author into a dark psychodrama of her own making</p><p>Shirley Jackson, the mid-century master of American Gothic, was not one to adhere to the mundane or the real. Though in real life a housewife in Vermont, mother of four children and a contributor to magazines such as Good Housekeeping and Woman’s Home Companion, Jackson’s fiction was dark and supernaturally twisted. Her short story The Lottery, which earned her notoriety when published in the New Yorker in 1948 (she was 32), devolves into a stoning ritual in a pious New England town. Her most famous novel, The Haunting of Hill House, is a masterclass ghost story in which it’s unclear if the haunting is the house or the powerful potential of one’s own insanity. Jackson’s most insightful and terrifying domain was the gruesome, spectral possibilities of the unhinged female mind, especially one locked inside by fear, or the men outside it.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/26/shirley-review-elisabeth-moss-literary-psychodrama">Shirley review – Elisabeth Moss anchors darkly compelling literary psychodrama</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/03/shirley-jackson-elisabeth-moss-film-horror-author-lottery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From its sublime palaces and museums to its divine art deco markets, the city’s glorious architecture is lovingly captured in a thrilling new book. But can it survive a tidal wave of foreign investment?</p><p>Hovering like a banana-coloured flying saucer above the dusty, congested streets of scooters and cyclo taxis, the central market of <a href="http://www.arte-charpentier.com/en/projet/phnom-penh-market/">Phnom Penh</a> is a remarkable thing. Its enormous concrete dome rises in sharply serrated steps, perforated with screens of chevron tiles, above four long streamlined arms that stretch out like the wings of a benevolent mothership, sheltering the chaotic labyrinth of market stalls below. Built in the 1930s, as a futuristic fusion of French art deco and Khmer temple motifs, it featured the second largest concrete dome in the world at the time (trumped only by the Pantheon in Rome), a fitting symbol of the Cambodian capital’s status as the “Pearl of Asia”.</p><p>I didn’t have high hopes for Phnom Penh when I arrived there on a backpacking trip in 2003, after a few days exploring the jungle temple complex of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/aug/16/lost-cities-6-angkor-wat-nasa-technology-khmer-megacity">Angkor Wat</a> and the floating villages of <a href="https://www.outsidenomad.com/tonle-sap-lake/">Tonlé Sap</a>.

<p>Keen to show he has a grip, the prime minister is gambling with people’s health as he tries to get back to Brexit</p><p>News that Boris Johnson is to take “direct control” of the government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/02/exclusive-boris-johnson-takes-back-control-coronavirus-crisis/">raises more questions than it answers</a>.

Taking back control seems to be rather harder than it sounds. Maybe he should have grasped that a bit sooner.&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to get a grip goes with the job. Prime ministers dream of being able to make an announcement, issue an order and then pull a lever or press a button so that things will happen. It almost never works, which is why prime ministers react by doing what Johnson has just done. They shake up Downing Street. They bring in new people. They form new committees. Then they try again. Sometimes the problem is the prime minister. More often the problem is the state machine. In Johnson’s case it is both, which is a bad combination.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/johnsons-mission-accomplished-mode-on-covid-19-shows-how-rattled-he-is">Continue reading...</a>

But when he first read the script, the actor had a few questions about his character. Chiefly: “Does he have to be a Trump supporter?”&nbsp;</p><p>He says: “I remember saying to Spike, ‘I’ve got a 17-year-old son, man. I don’t want him seeing me representing this person.’” Like Lee, who routinely refers to Donald Trump as Agent Orange, Lindo can barely bring himself to identify the president by name. “It had to do with my values, as a parent and as a being on the planet, feeling that I would be representing an individual who is ... I don’t have the words to discuss this individual.” Couldn’t the character, he pleaded, just be an arch-conservative? “Spike thought about it for a few days, then said, ‘Yeah, I really need him to be a Trump supporter.’”&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/03/delroy-lindo-george-floyd-protests-da-5-bloods-spike-lee-british-racism-america">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Two high-school students embark on a fake affair to combat prejudice in 90s Ireland in a well-meaning but derivative drama</p><p>David Freyne’s eager-to-please coming-of-age movie set in the 90s has the sort of high concept that could well have been greenlit in the 90s, though for an adult romcom, not a high-school film. Fionn O’Shea plays Eddie, a high-school kid preparing for his leaving certificate in County Kildare in Ireland; his dad, Ian (Barry Ward), is a senior army officer at the nearby barracks at the Curragh Camp and expects Eddie to follow in his footsteps. Meanwhile, Amber (Lola Petticrew) is a disaffected teenager in Eddie’s year who yearns to escape to what she imagines to be the punk nirvana of London.</p><p>What Eddie and Amber have in common is that they are secretly gay, and people are beginning to whisper about their apparent lack of interest in dating the opposite sex. So of course they find it mutually convenient to be each other’s beard, creating the public fiction of being a couple to get the homophobes off their backs. But this creates a strangely intense relationship between them that isn’t easily shrugged off when real romantic-partner candidates come into view.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/03/dating-amber-review-fionn-oshea-sharon-horgan">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A guide to making the classic American salad that was, in fact, invented by an Italian restaurateur in Mexico</p><p>Despite its imperial name, caesar salad was created in 1920s Mexico to feed the hordes of thirsty Americans forced across the border by prohibition. Wanting to relieve the pressure on his kitchen, restaurateur <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_Cardini">Caesar Cardini</a> came up with a recipe simple enough to be prepared by his waiters instead.

<p>These little treats will make you leap for joy<br /></p><p>I love cake pops and they are the perfect treat as they last quite a while in the fridge. The buttercream and chocolate mean they don’t lose their moistness. Normally, cake pops are attached to a stick or straw – I improvised with umbrella cocktail sticks. The result is a group of little frogs chilling under their umbrellas. The cake pops are dipped in the chocolate and then just left to set on baking paper.

<p>The American, one of four men to win three sprint gold medals at an Olympic Games, is remembered as much for the infamy his business dealings provoked as his glorious running style</p><p>Four men have won the sprint triple of 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the Olympics and, chances are, you know three of them: Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt. Then there is Bobby Joe Morrow, who died last weekend at the age of 84. When Morrow won all three at the Melbourne Games in 1956 he was, briefly, as famous as any of the others. He was a guest on the Ed Sullivan show, same episode as Marcel Marceau, and Arthur Godfrey and His Friends, <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x0EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" title="">he made the cover of Life magazine</a> and was even named by the US Chamber of Commerce as one of nine Great Living Americans, right alongside Cecil B DeMille and Norman Rockwell.</p><p>Sports Illustrated made him <a href="https://vault.si.com/vault/1957/01/07/sportsman-of-1956" title="">its sportsman of 1956</a>, the same year Floyd Patterson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history and Mickey Mantle won the triple crown for the Yankees. Morrow was 21 years old, tall, handsome, and “the Beau Ideal of the US Olympic team”. He grew up on a farm in San Benito, way down in south-east Texas, his father was an elder in the Church of Christ, and the family were “prosperous, unostentatious, and deeply religious”. The way they told it, his only vice was ice cream. It made him something “a little larger than a fine sprinter”. He was the “sort of American which most of the world has had too little opportunity to know”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/03/bobby-joe-morrow-1956-olympic-sprint-champion-lost-his-way">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What will happen after this news cycle is over and social media posts about diversity die down? Layla F Saad chooses books to fortify a long-term struggle</p><p>Every black person I know right now is exhausted. They are exhausted by the two pandemics disproportionately hurting and killing black people: Covid-19 and white supremacy. Covid-19 is a new sickness that hopefully we’ll soon find a cure for, or at least learn to live with. But white supremacy is a disease as old as time, for which we’ve been waiting generations to see a cure.</p><p>As we mourn and seek justice for the murders of George Floyd, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/25/the-killing-of-ahmaud-arbery">Ahmaud Arbery</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky">Breonna Taylor</a>, <a href="https://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-mourns-nina-pop-black-transgender-woman-killed-in-missouri">Nina Pop</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/michael-brown-ferguson-america-george-floyd">Tony McDade</a> (to name but a few), many black people such as myself are wondering: what will happen when the news cycle is over, the social justice memes are no longer posted, and the declarations for inclusivity, diversity and “doing the work” have died down? What happens when white people, momentarily awoken from the comfortable slumber of white privilege by this moment of unignorable protest, go back to sleep? How do we actually create an anti-racist world and rid ourselves of this sickness and system of white supremacy, when the people who benefit from it are not showing up to do the work?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/jun/03/do-the-work-an-anti-racist-reading-list-layla-f-saad">Continue reading...</a>

## The pandemic is being used as cover for a no-deal Brexit | Mujtaba Rahman

<p>The Vote Leavers at the heart of government think the coronavirus crash will disguise the pain caused by a rupture with the EU</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest">Coronavirus – latest updates</a><br /></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Most of us who have followed Brexit closely believed coronavirus would soften the government’s stance in trade talks with Europe. The economic shock triggered by the pandemic, and the fact Whitehall is so overwhelmed managing it, made it more likely the government would extend the transition period, due to expire at the end of this year, or strike a deal. It turns out that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/29/june-brexit-summit-on-cards-talks-heading-for-deadlock">the opposite</a> is true. Rather than encouraging a more flexible and pragmatic approach, Covid-19 has instead reinforced the case for no deal at the very top of government.</p><p>Perhaps the most important driver is the belief among ministers that the UK economy will be permanently reshaped by the crisis, as companies create new supply chains and reshore production to provide greater resilience in the future, not least in case of another pandemic. The government wants a free hand to facilitate this change, one that it believes would be constrained by the EU’s demand that the UK remain tied to its labour and environmental standards and state aid rules.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/03/pandemic-no-deal-brexit-vote-leavers-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>
