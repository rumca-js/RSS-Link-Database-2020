You\u2019re part of the rising second generation of Italian mobsters that spoke English and were raised in America. You didn\u2019t care for silly things. You were an entrepreneur and a Scilian. You saw the opportunity to make even more money by expanding operations into new ventures.\n\nJoe the Boss was against the second biggest Italian borgata, headed by Salvatore Maranzano. He was too power hungry and caught up in his giant ego. And you\u2019ve grown a little disenchanted by all this violence. Even if this war were to end right now, war will certainly break out again in the future. After some murders here & there, you end this war and created The Commission.\n\nThis war started when your boss, Giuseppe Joe the Boss Masseria, got the idea that he would be able to declare himself as the boss of bosses, and all the other gangs would just submit to his rule.\n\nEighteen months later, you finally decided to end it. You went to Maranzano and made a deal behind your bosses back. You\u2019ll get to claim victory and get recognized as the new boss of Joe\u2019s family. Maranzano accepted. And boom - the war was over. Maranzano won and recognized you as the boss.\n\nBut Maranzano decided to go back on the deal he made with you by making the same arrogant mistake that Joe the Boss made. Maranzano forced all families into the tight chain of command. He brought all the traditional rules from the Sicilian mafia to America. Maranzano betrayed you. If you don\u2019t act fast, you\u2019ll be lying next to your old boss.\n\nEveryone knew Luciano was practically the Boss of all Bosses. The Five Families slowly but surely DESTROYED their competition. Lucky Luciano became the most powerful mobster in New York.\n\nThe rise of the ambitious Luciano gave rise to an prosecutor, named Thomas Dewey. Dewey\u2019s goal was to paint the prostitutes as poor that Lucky took advantage of. Luciano was sentenced to 30-50 years in prison. Once he was out of prison, Dewey got him deported back to Italy and never got to see his beloved home of New York ever again until he died of a heart attack at 64.\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
