Perhaps unsurprisingly, Khruangbin are frequently mislabeled as a Thai-funk band. The trio \u2014 comprising bassist Lee, along with guitarist Mark Speer and drummer Donald \"DJ\" Johnson \u2014 cite many influences, and they call Houston, Texas, home. On Friday, June 26, Khruangbin release their next album, \"Mordecai.\" In honor of that, we're spotlighting these performances recorded by Khruangbin in our studio in 2018.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Maria Tambien\"\n03:09 \"Lady and Man\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nLaura Lee - bass\nMark Speer - guitar\nDonald \"DJ\" Johnson - drums\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Derrick Stevens\n\nFIND MORE:\n2018 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2018/04/23/khruangbin-perform-in-the-current-studio\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcs2IKV-DX4", "date_published": "2020-06-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Nur-D - full session at The Current", "description": "Just a little over a year ago, in June 2019, rapper Nur-D (aka Matt Allen) performed for the first time in our studio. Nur-D didn't start out as the hip-hop artist he is today. In fact, he went from being a shy guy playing keyboard in a rock band to becoming the five-time Shut Up and Rap Champion in 2018. \"I've always loved [hip-hop],\" Nur-D says, \"but I never thought it'd be something that I would do \u2014 mostly because I'm weird.\" Nur-D made it onto the 2018 Soundset Music Festival bill three months after starting his rap career in February of that year. In 2020, Nur-D continued to perform until the pandemic lockdowns. In May and June of this year, Allen gained noteworthy attention on the scene not for his musical vocation but rather as a medic taking part and assisting protesters during the demonstrations for justice following the killing of George Floyd.\n\nSONGS PERFORMED\n00:00 \"Take My Picture\"\n03:21 \"Nin10doh\"\n06:18 \"Black Wizard Wave\"\n\nPERSONNEL\nNUR-D (Matt Allen)\nDJ Hayes\n\nCREDITS\nVideo & Photo: Nate Ryan, Helen Teague\nAudio: Michael DeMark\nProduction: Andrea Swensson\n\nFIND MORE:\n2019 studio session: https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/06/10/nur-d-session\n\nSubscribe to our channel:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/893TheCurrent?sub_confirmation=1\nLike/Follow:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheCurrent/\nhttps://twitter.com/TheCurrent\nhttps://www.instagram.com/thecurrent/", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBNZW30eATU", "date_published": "2020-06-24 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCAKcSON6PSG_JkTbXh2WdIg", "title": "Sounds Like Home: MaLLy, Molly Maher, Ashley DuBose, Mayda, Bad Bad Hats, Mae Simpson, Lady Midnight", "description": "Sounds Like Home II: On June 24, 2020, The Current is hosting another round of Sounds Like Home for an afternoon of virtual performances celebrating Minnesota musicians.
