We finally went hands-on with one of the most anticipated games of the generation, Cyberpunk 2077, and in this video, Jake Dekker, Tamoor Hussain, and Edmond Tran describe their experiences with the opening hours of the game. Each of them built their characters as different from one another as they could, selecting divergent life paths and building up their stats and skillsets in unique ways.

This means that we saw all three of Cyberpunk's opening prologue sequences, which situate the protagonist, V, in different locations and set up different origin stories. We talk about how that affected our experience with the game, and describe what we got up to in our hours exploring the open world of Night City.

Cyberpunk 2077 releases on November 18 for PC, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. The game is also confirmed to be coming to Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, with a free upgrade for existing owners of the game for Xbox One and PS4.

## One Big Thing Assassin's Creed Valhalla Should Learn From Odyssey
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUaFM2PUxto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUaFM2PUxto)

The Assassin's Creed franchise is known for being very serious--but Odyssey was a refreshing change of pace with its boisterous and joyful humor. In a new video, Jess McDonell explains why she hopes the humor from Odyssey carries forward to the new Assassin's Creed game, Valhalla, which is releasing later this year. 

Be sure to watch the full video to see Jess explain why Valhalla should carry forward Odyssey's light and humorous tone, or at least retain some element of it. 

This would help vary the tone of Valhalla beyond the serious core narrative, just as it did in Odyssey, an important factor if we're to expect a world just as sprawling as Ubisoft's Ancient Greece, Jess says in the video.

Valhalla releases later this year on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, in addition to the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.
