But you ran out of options to make money legally. It looks like we\u2019re gonna have to explore more means of business. Becoming a career bank robber is the only logical route.\n\nRobbing banks is like any other business or investment. The more risk you take on, the more money and ROI you\u2019re gonna make. \n\nYou have to keep in mind not to do what\u2019s expected by the public or law enforcement. Study the data on what most would-be bank robbers do on their heists and figure out a way to do the opposite to confuse law enforcement. This is where the money is at.\n\nPartner up with other people. You can rob bigger banks and take home bigger takes. With multiple people, you can instill more fear into the employees and customers. The biggest downside to this is that legitimate partnerships in legal businesses are already risky enough. \n\nChoose the right bank to rob. If you\u2019re going in blazing, find out what kind of defense measures they have in place like panic buttons, bait money. If you\u2019re gonna do the whole breaking in at night to crack the vault, you\u2019re gonna need to choose a bank that has a security system you pass, a vault you\u2019re able to crack. Whatever bank you choose, you\u2019re gonna want to make sure it has multiple escape routes.\n\nChoose the right getaway car. If everyone invisions the perfect getaway car to be a van or tough looking SUV, use the exact opposite.\n\nBanks and authorities have gotten more and more sophisticated against thieves, just make sure you don\u2019t fall victim for any of these traps. Banks have cash with GPS trackers. Then there\u2019s the classic silent alarm or panic button that tellers can use.\n\nIt\u2019s the get rich quick moment we\u2019ve been waiting for. The number one thing you need to do is to instill fear into your subjects.\n\nOnce you\u2019re in and out, boom! You just made some instant easy money ;)\nBut we\u2019re not done yet, so escape in that getaway car and let\u2019s move onto the final step\n\nYou have all this heist money that you just scored but before you can use that money, you have to make sure it looks legitimate, whether that be a job, business or investments. This is where money laundering comes in. Once you\u2019ve laundered your score - you\u2019re good to go! Just make sure that if it was a really big score, or any score for that matter, it probably wouldn\u2019t be very wise to make any big purchases right away\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
