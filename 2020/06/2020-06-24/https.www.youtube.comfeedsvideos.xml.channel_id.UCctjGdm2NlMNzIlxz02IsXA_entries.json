In that crisis it left behind core aspects of the series that set it apart from the crowd, in favor of mechanics that turned it into just another first person shooter. Today, I'll be talking (perhaps too passionately) about why Sprint, and by extension, Enhanced Mobility, don't belong in Halo games ... but I'll also be discussing ways the fun of fast paced modern combat could be introduced to the series in a way that keeps the core formula intact.\n\nThis isn't a video game channel, I know. But I'm passionate about this for some reason and at the end of the day, that's why I made my channel in the first place. To talk about things I think are funny or to talk about things I care a lot about. I hope that at least a fraction of you gain something out of this, even if you're not into Halo. \n\n#HaloInfinite\n\nSHIRTS \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/chris-ray-gun\r\nTWITTER \u25ba https://twitter.com/ChrisRGun\r\nFACEBOOK \u25ba http://on.fb.me/15OyE7z\r\nTWITCH \u25ba http://www.twitch.tv/chrisraygun\r\nPATREON \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/ChrisRay\r\nSUBREDDIT \u25ba https://www.reddit.com/r/ChrisRayGun/\r\nSACRED SYMBOLS  \u25ba https://apple.co/2Rqmklc\r\nSECOND CHANNEL \u25ba bit.ly/snarktank", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qq9suaLMNM", "date_published": "2020-06-25 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
