So recently I’ve been going through business marketing data, and I noticed a few, uh, massive inconsistencies. 
While this video started off as a discussion on 24 hour cable news and such, I realized quickly those sources, through television, have very, very little impact. 
And so the only other outlet was the online world, which seems to be where these organizations have the most “reach”.
But here’s the thing, social media platforms, websites, and specifically these organizations seem to be highly inflating numbers to fool potential ad clients into working with them.
This isn’t a small falsehood either, these inflated numbers are multiple times higher than reality.

So let’s talk about that.
