## Seasteading – a vanity project for the rich or the future of humanity?

<p>Beloved by Silicon Valley tycoons and tyranny-fearing libertarians, are cities atop the waves Earth’s next frontier?</p><p>A white steel pole rises out of the sea off the Caribbean coast of Panama, poking above the waves like the funnel of a sunken steamship. Launched into the water last month, this is no shipwreck, but the base of what will soon become a floating home and, in the eyes of its makers, the first step towards building a brave new post-Covid-19 society, out on the open ocean.<br /><br />“Coronavirus is an opportunity to show the world that what we’re building is actually going to be very useful in the future,” says Chad Elwartowski, in a <a href="https://lbry.tv/@FirstSeasteader:e/DroneTestSea:8?fbclid=IwAR357n5Aw_xk8YdUatlw-LAvgn3K_ehKO06D47VFz5nDtSqiZGr0UWWUZI4">recent video post</a> from his beachside base in Panama. The Michigan-born software engineer turned bitcoin trader is a leading figure in the seasteading movement, a libertarian group dedicated to building independent floating cities on the high seas. Along with the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/mar/27/underground-skyscrapers-and-off-grid-bunkers-inside-the-world-of-preppers">bunker builders and survivalist preppers</a>, their long-held ambitions have been bolstered by the current global pandemic. “No matter if you’re scared of the virus or the reaction to the virus,” he adds, “living out on the ocean will be helpful for these situations.”<br /><br />It is not the first time Elwartowski has attempted to realise his dream of a floating future. In April last year, he and his Thai partner Supranee Thepdet (aka Nadia Summergirl), were forced to flee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/18/us-bitcoin-trader-may-face-death-penalty-in-thailand-over-sea-home">their first floating home</a> off the coast of Thailand, just moments before it was raided by the Thai navy. They had constructed what they declared to be <a href="https://ocean.builders/first-seastead-has-been-set-up-in-international-waters/">“the first seastead”</a> 12 nautical miles from Phuket, but the authorities decided that the six metre-wide fibreglass cabin, perched on top of a floating pole, posed a threat to Thailand’s sovereignty. It was an<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-seahome/thai-navy-tows-floating-home-of-fugitive-us-seasteader-idUSKCN1RY0SX"> offence punishable by life imprisonment</a> or even the death penalty. “The couple announced on social media declaring their autonomy beyond the jurisdiction of any courts or law of any countries, including Thailand,” said Rear Admiral Vithanarat Kochaseni, adding that they had invited others to join them. “We see such action as deteriorating Thailand’s independence.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/24/seasteading-a-vanity-project-for-the-rich-or-the-future-of-humanity">Continue reading...</a>

<p>From health spending to test and trace, the German response to coronavirus has many lessons for the UK. But can we learn them?</p><p>Rest assured that this is a column about politics, not football. Nevertheless the most resonant political insight of the week has come from Liverpool’s manager Jürgen Klopp, who has guided his team to the threshold of winning the Premier League. On the eve of the resumed 2019-20 football season, Liverpool’s German coach was asked last weekend whether he had ever worried about the dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic to the completion of the season. His answer was one to savour.</p><p>“The problem I had,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/20/ive-been-worried-about-people-dying-not-the-title-says-jurgen-klopp">replied Klopp</a>, “was that I was getting the news from Germany as well as from England.

It’s also known, especially outside the region, as <em>tarte à la flamme</em> or <em>tarte flambée</em>, though no alcohol is involved in its production – as the name suggests, it’s a tart, albeit one that’s cooked quickly in a hot oven much like a pizza, then topped with distinctly un-Italian combination of salt pork and soured cream.</p><p>It is, however, often enjoyed <em>with</em> alcohol, and pairs particularly well with a chilled glass of crisp riesling or pinot blanc – preferably local, sitting at a cafe in a half-timbered square festooned with geraniums, happily watching the world go by.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/24/how-to-make-the-perfect-flammekueche-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

## All hail halloumi! 17 delicious recipes – from salty fritters to harissa flatbreads

<p>Beyond the barbecue, there are many exciting ways to cook with this hugely versatile ingredient, from fruity salads to an easy aubergine pie</p><p>The key to the versatility of halloumi cheese is its high melting point – you can’t grill a lump of cheddar on a barbecue. Packaged in brine, it also keeps for ages – the halloumi in my fridge passes its best-before date at the end of August, and I don’t remember when I bought it. Sliced and fried (not too long; a couple of minutes on each side), with a squeeze of lemon, halloumi adds a salty, pleasantly squeaky note to almost any salad. But there’s more than one way to cook with halloumi. Here are 17 to be getting on with.</p><p>First up is Claire Thomson’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/30/how-make-halloumi-cheese">recipe for halloumi itself</a>. I can see that if you’re looking for innovative ways to use up your halloumi surplus, making more halloumi is a little counterproductive, but this is a project you can embark on with kids, and the process alone is worth reading about. The recipe’s biggest drawback is that it calls for 10 litres of milk. “They’d think you were insane at the shop,” my son said, perfectly crystallising my anxieties. A couple of months ago I could have pretended I was hoarding, but not now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/24/all-hail-halloumi-17-delicious-recipes-from-salty-fritters-to-harissa-flatbreads">Continue reading...</a>

## Why the 'romance' of plantation estates is more dangerous than confederate statues | Chase Quinn

<p>Instead of fixating exclusively on statues, we need to dramatically expand our understanding of what constitutes a monument</p><p>Like all symbols, monuments to the Confederate south, the lost cause, are not confined to the public square. On the contrary, they are projected onto the silver screen, in our backyards, making up the names of countless suburban developments, shopping centers and schools. In Charleston, South Carolina, in particular, they undergird a billion-dollar tourist industry.</p><p>Voted the No 1 city in the US seven times in a row by Travel + Leisure and the best city in the world in 2017, millions come for the beaches, the beauty and charm of Rainbow Row and its old-timey cobblestone streets (built by slaves), and last but certainly not least, for the romance and sweep of its great houses and plantations. The image of Scarlett O’Hara sauntering around Terra in a hoop skirt is imprinted on our collective imagination. Black or white, who hasn’t fantasized about being her? We are meant to. As sure as most monuments tend to obfuscate or deny access to history, on the contrary, these plantation estates invite us into the fantasy: for tours, for weddings, for re-enactments, for fine wine tastings.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/24/romance-plantation-estates-dangerous-confederate-statues">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The urgent need to reorganise life on Earth is clear to almost everyone, how we do it less so. Fortunately science fiction has drawn up some good plans<br /></p><p>There is no consensus on what constitutes a better future or how to cultivate one – such nebulous concepts can really only be interpreted through the prism of personal situation.&nbsp;Clean energy, universal access to medical services and education, being well clothed, well fed and having basic rights are some of the essentials any civilised individual would ask for before branching off into their own wish list.&nbsp;</p><p>Right now, in the midst of lockdown, the overriding drive is, understandably, for a return to normality and the stability it brings.&nbsp;But there is a growing awareness that things cannot carry on as before. We are more mindful of the natural world and the effect we’ve had on it, conscious of how other people matter to us, and awake to consumerism’s unearned dominance in our lives.&nbsp;We need to examine the potential for more enduring and sustainable futures.&nbsp;And science fiction certainly spends plenty of time looking for future paradises, even if we don’t always get there.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/24/top-10-books-about-remaking-the-future-peter-f-hamilton">Continue reading...</a>

Filipino restaurants are distinctly lacking compared with those featuring the food of the country’s south-east Asian cousins. This must change, because Filipino cuisine offers an amazing variety of delicious dishes that need to be sampled. I learned how to make these aubergine omelettes from my Filipina friend Regie while working in Malawi. They are so simple and are a great idea for brunch after a morning run (you can prepare the aubergines in advance).

## Netflix's Floor Is Lava: the show to save the summer?

<p>The idea behind the show is blazingly inane – get across a room without touching the bubbling red ‘floor’. It’s also amazing entertainment for the entire family</p><p>Here’s a confession, and not a particularly great one for somebody paid to write about television: I have struggled with TV under lockdown. It has been difficult to find anything that fits my mood at any given time. I don’t have the energy to sit through a brave, new complicated series, but at the same time I struggle to see the point of anything deliberately lightweight. My viewing history for the last few months is essentially a pile of shows that were picked up and quickly dropped.</p><p>So it is with some relief that I have found something I can watch. Something that fits perfectly into the part of my brain that I want to switch off. I can watch it on my own or with my kids. It’s new. It’s silly enough to be diverting, but requires almost no participation on my part. It is Netflix’s Floor Is Lava, and I’m lucky to have it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/24/netflixs-floor-is-lava-the-show-to-save-the-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The numerous challenges of 2020 have hit Trump hard – but the conditions are ripe for a repeat surprise victory, some experts say</p><p>If Donald Trump wins the 2020 election and returns to the White House it won’t be by a landslide. And if he’s going to win at all he will need the US economy to rebound, to see suburban voters swing back in his direction, and overwhelm voters with a sense of optimism about another term under Trump.</p><p>That’s the verdict of about a dozen Republican veteran political strategists and operatives spoken to by the Guardian. Those priorities underscore the precarious situation the US president finds himself in. Most national and statewide polls show the former vice-president Joe Biden leading Trump, often by comfortable margins.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/24/will-trump-win-election-2020-beat-joe-biden-experts-on-chances">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Young centre-back has been at Stamford Bridge since he was nine but after a season of learning on loan at Burton Albion, his release at 21 means the next step is approaching</p><p>“The first thing that happened was a ball got kicked in the air at me and I got an elbow in the face,” Richard Nartey says as he recalls his gritty introduction to League One after going on loan to Burton Albion. The centre-back, who has been at Chelsea since he was nine, knew it was time to sink or swim. He was making his professional debut after coming off the bench against Bristol Rovers in August and it was a rude awakening.</p><p>“I was a bit dazed,” Nartey says. “It was my wake-up call. I was telling myself: ‘You’ve got to give it back.

Some of this is due to natural fluctuations, especially in areas where there are very few cases, and so a rise from 1 to 2 is a doubling.

He was quite the hurricane back in the day, but now he likes to sip whiskey and tell tales, some of them tall enough. He knew some fine and beautiful women, and he talks tenderly, as if they were still beautiful even now. He’s sailed some stormy seas, been up that creek without a paddle, and he has some old-time wisdom to impart. But he wraps it up in smoke and wind, , though, so you never can tell whether you’ve been tricked or treated. It just annoys the hell out of some people. I can’t take the way he sings, but I love to hear him talk.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/23/bob-dylan-rough-and-rowdy-ways-guardian-readers-have-their-say">Continue reading...</a>

## Britain's persistent racism cannot simply be explained by its imperial history | David Edgerton

<p>It played its part, but empire does not explain all of Britain’s record of elitism, exploitation and discrimination </p><p>The question of empire has become central to discussions of Britain’s national past. Some see residual imperialism as the prime element in a deficient, delusional, racist culture. Others think emphasising the dark underside of empire is an attempt to erase British history. The problem is that although long historical tradition sanctions criticism of imperialism, national history has proved far more resistant.</p><p>Talk of empire is now omnipresent, but it was previously <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/18/lying-history-britain-statues-slave-trade">written out of history</a>. In the 1940s the unashamed imperialist Winston Churchill didn’t offer an imperial history of the second world war, or even a national one, but an Anglo-American, cold-war version of events in his six-volume work, The Second World War. Subsequently, what’s striking about postwar historiography is the lack of imperialist histories and the absence of condemnation for nationalist and anti-imperial forces. At most there were<em> </em>sotto voce claims that the British empire should have done a deal with Adolf Hitler in 1940 to keep itself alive.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/24/britain-persistent-racism-imperial-history">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Garrulous and inappropriate, Renée Zellweger’s heroine drove home the farce of impossible, gendered standards.

Bridget watched over us as we slept back-to-back at sleepovers, analysed whether it was worth spending 10p of precious phone credit replying to an SMS from a boy off the bus and built a brains trust of everything we knew about sex. Plenty has been written about how <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/may/26/helen-fielding-says-bridget-jones-books-are-not-anti-feminist">Helen Fielding</a>’s creation is antifeminist and perpetuates outdated ideas about body image and marriage as the ultimate goal for a woman. But in many ways Bridget was a sound guide through those formative years.</p><p>Aged 12 I had already read the book, assuming it – probably not incorrectly – to be a kind of adult version of Adrian Mole. (I felt let down by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/jan/29/tvandradio.television3">The Cappuccino Years</a>: Mole cooking offal in some restaurant was much less interesting than measuring his willy with a ruler.) It was rude and funny – I loved it. When the film was announced, I knew some people were annoyed that an American actor had been cast as Bridget but I had no idea who Zellweger was either way so I didn’t care. Plus my beloved Geri Halliwell was on the soundtrack: what could anyone have to complain about? The trailer quickly became a communal classroom obsession, the line “wanton sex goddess with a very bad man between her thighs – mum, hi!” quickly deposing childish Simpsons catchphrases, because pre-teen girls are ardent perverts.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/24/my-favourite-film-aged-12-bridget-jones-diary-renee-zellweger">Continue reading...</a>

These essential tips from one seasoned home-worker will make the rising temperature a breeze</p><p><br />This is set to be the hottest week of the year so far.

But now you are working from home, in a residence that has been specifically insulated to remain warm in winter. In short, things are about to get uncomfortable.</p><p>This is where I step in. For the past three years, I have worked from a garden office that effectively acts as a giant greenhouse and, in the summer months, runs between five and 10 degrees warmer than the air outside.

<p>When international correspondent Michael Safi began looking into why Jordan had become the country with the highest smoking rates in the world, he began to uncover what public health advocates have described as widespread interference in policymaking by multinational tobacco companies</p><p>Guardian international correspondent <strong>Michael Safi </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana</strong> about why he decided to look into smoking rates in the Middle Eastern kingdom of Jordan. They have become the highest in the world, with more than eight in 10 Jordanian men smoking or regularly using nicotine products including vapes and e-cigarettes, according to a government study carried out in 2019 in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Jordanian men who smoke daily consume an average of 23 cigarettes a day, the survey found. </p><p>But Michael’s story soon turned into an investigation as he began to uncover what public-health advocates say is <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/23/jordan-smoking-rates-highest-in-world-amid-claims-of-big-tobacco-interference">widespread interference in policymaking by multinational tobacco companies</a>. The industry casts itself as a major investor and job creator, an especially potent argument in a country with high unemployment, where tobacco taxes amount to around<a href="https://www.jordantimes.com/opinion/jawad-anani/smoking-economics"> 18% of the government’s</a> annual revenue. The impacts of so much smoking are already stark: tobacco use is linked to one in eight deaths in the country, compared with<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/apr/05/smoking-causes-one-in-ten-deaths-globally-major-new-study-reveals"> one in 10 deaths worldwide</a>, and costs Jordan’s GDP an estimated three times the global average.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/24/how-did-jordan-end-up-with-the-highest-smoking-rate-in-the-world">Continue reading...</a>
