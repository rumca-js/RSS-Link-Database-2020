Let's get the big question answered right away. "The name means 'airplane' in Thai," says Khruangbin's Laura Lee. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Khruangbin are frequently mislabeled as a Thai-funk band. The trio — comprising bassist Lee, along with guitarist Mark Speer and drummer Donald "DJ" Johnson — cite many influences, and they call Houston, Texas, home. On Friday, June 26, Khruangbin release their next album, "Mordecai." In honor of that, we're spotlighting these performances recorded by Khruangbin in our studio in 2018.

SONGS PERFORMED
00:00 "Maria Tambien"
03:09 "Lady and Man"

PERSONNEL
Laura Lee - bass
Mark Speer - guitar
Donald "DJ" Johnson - drums

## Nur-D - full session at The Current
 - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBNZW30eATU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBNZW30eATU)

Just a little over a year ago, in June 2019, rapper Nur-D (aka Matt Allen) performed for the first time in our studio. Nur-D didn't start out as the hip-hop artist he is today. In fact, he went from being a shy guy playing keyboard in a rock band to becoming the five-time Shut Up and Rap Champion in 2018. "I've always loved [hip-hop]," Nur-D says, "but I never thought it'd be something that I would do — mostly because I'm weird." Nur-D made it onto the 2018 Soundset Music Festival bill three months after starting his rap career in February of that year. In 2020, Nur-D continued to perform until the pandemic lockdowns. In May and June of this year, Allen gained noteworthy attention on the scene not for his musical vocation but rather as a medic taking part and assisting protesters during the demonstrations for justice following the killing of George Floyd.

SONGS PERFORMED
00:00 "Take My Picture"
03:21 "Nin10doh"
06:18 "Black Wizard Wave"
