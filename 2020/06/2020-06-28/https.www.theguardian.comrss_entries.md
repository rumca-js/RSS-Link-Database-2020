<p>(Virgin)<br />The singer-songwriter swaps luxe pop for the energy of the dancefloor on her heady fourth album</p><p>Jessie Ware emerged in 2010, lending her silken vocals to electro producer SBTRKT. A solo career followed but, while the London singer-songwriter’s first three albums contained garage inflections, the focus was on luxe pop. In the years since her last set, 2017’s <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/oct/22/jessie-ware-glasshouse-review">Glasshouse</a></em>, she has had her second child and started a food podcast with her mum – but album number four doesn’t champion domesticity. Featuring credits from the likes of Metronomy’s Joe Mount and producer/songwriter Kindness, <em>What’s Your Pleasure</em> is full of dancefloor energy instead, with careening strings, uplifting percussion and spiky licks of synth and guitar. Mirage (Don’t Stop) is slinky and seductive (“I know I said it before, but you can do what you want”, Ware croons over sleek bass), while the title track and the glorious <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX1MykFo-gg">Ooh La La</a> bask in the glow of a fun night out.

## Nadine Shah: Kitchen Sink review – razor-sharp observations

<p>(Infectious)<br />The singer-songwriter’s follow-up to Holiday Destination is a slow-burning joy</p><p>North-eastern singer-songwriter Nadine Shah won acclaim – and a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/08/nadine-shah-holiday-destination-interview-mercury">Mercury prize nomination</a> – for her 2017 album, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/24/nadine-shah-holiday-destination-review-simmering-post-punk-from-the-edge">Holiday Destination</a></em>, in part because she was one of the few artists to actually attempt to address Europe’s refugee crisis. The follow-up is just as political, but this time the focus is more personal, as she considers what it means to be a thirtysomething woman today: is it “wrong” that at 34 she is neither married nor a mother?</p><p>Any fears that this is going to be po-faced navel-gazing are dispelled by the brass-powered opener, Club Cougar, about a relationship with someone “one year younger – call me a cougar”. A seam of such lyrical boldness runs throughout <em>Kitchen Sink</em>, which is offset nicely by the taut post-punk backing, made once again with longtime foil Ben Hillier. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX9bxRCVWnI">Ladies for Babies (Goats for Love)</a> is a case in point, musically as austere as <em>Rid of Me</em>-era PJ Harvey, but blessed with razor-sharp observations (“He wants his lady/ To be a lady/ To care less, be hairless/ All he wants in fairness/ Is a baby”) and a very direct chorus. In that respect, it’s something of an outlier – there’s little else here that is as immediate. Instead, <em>Kitchen Sink</em> is an album that slowly charms its way into your conscience, and is all the more pleasing for that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/28/nadine-shah-kitchen-sink-review-razor-sharp-observations">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Large mice are devastating rare birds on a tiny island, now moves are afoot to exterminate the rodents. But should conservation ever be about killing?</p><p>Gough Island is about as remote a fragment of land as it is possible to find on a map. Its 91 square kilometres of uninhabited volcanic rock rise from the South Atlantic, 3,200km east of South America and 1,700 miles west of Cape Town. But even this apparently pristine home to 8 million seabirds has been reshaped by humanity. Nineteenth-century seal-hunters visiting the island inadvertently introduced a stowaway: the house mouse. In the years since, this innocuous-looking species, the island’s only mammal, has become its top predator, rapidly evolving to twice its original size.</p><p>This monster mouse now eats seabirds alive. Ornithologists first discovered chicks of the endangered Tristan albatross with gaping wounds in 2001. Nocturnal nest cameras revealed the reason: mice clambering in and gnawing and devouring the chicks. Worse, they could even eat adult birds. They also predated thecritically endangered Gough bunting, which is only found on the isolated island. An estimated 2 million fewer seabirds fledge each year because of the mouse.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jun/28/should-we-cull-one-species-to-save-another-huge-mice-killing-birds-gough-island">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering’s intersectional approach to exploring sexual abuse in the music industry is candid and empathetic</p><p>This essential documentary from Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering offers a much needed recalibration of #MeToo, taking into account race and the additional weight shouldered by black women who decide to come forward with their experiences of rape and sexual abuse. The central story here is that of Drew Dixon, an eloquent, intelligent and talented woman who gave up a stellar career in A&amp;R as a result of the systemic culture of sexual abuse within the hip-hop music industry. The stories of her treatment at the hands of Def Jam Recordings head <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/russell-simmons">Russell Simmons</a> and others are harrowing; the film lays bare the great personal cost she wrestles with in her decision to go public 20 years later. “I do not want to be radioactive,” she observes, adding that by naming her abusers, she would be inviting back into her life the very chaos that she has managed to leave behind. The film’s empathetic approach allows Dixon to explore her decision, peeling back the layers of complexity that racism brings to the burden of sexual abuse. A must watch.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/may/26/on-the-record-russell-simmons-hbo-max">'People continue to turn a blind eye': behind a shocking film about music industry abuse</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/28/on-the-record-review-metoo-music-doc-is-essential-viewing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Lunch outside in the sun calls for fresh greens and juicy fruits</p><p>There’s a thick canopy of leaves over the garden table, lending shade to our lunch. The light is green, the air cool. It feels like eating underwater. We have chicken salad, the skin smoky and black from the grill, the meat juicy from an overnight soak with orange, honey and rosemary. After a rest to gather its juices, the warm chicken is tossed with avocado and refreshing, slightly bitter oranges. There are purple spring onions thinner than a pencil, too, and masses of parsley. I have put a bowl of watercress out as well, tossed with nothing more than the juice of a lemon and a few white-tipped breakfast radishes.</p><p>The meat is juicy from an overnight soak with orange, honey and needles of rosemary</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/28/nigel-slater-recipes-for-grilled-chicken-with-avocado-and-for-gooseberry-trifle">Continue reading...</a>

Outside our front window, sex workers comfort strangers again, and opposite Sainsbury’s men fight with their shirts off, like boar or rutting stags, arousing passing women, loveless for too long in lockdown. And in Parliament Square, Winston Churchill emerges from his winter wooden box, snuffling the virus-free air like a cocaine groundhog. It’s past midsummer, and spring has finally sprung.</p><p>By a strange coincidence, I actually saw the controversial statue of controversial Winston Churchill unveiled. It was November 1973, I was five years old, my mum had taken me to London for the first time, and we stumbled into the ceremony. A friendly man put me on his shoulders, unimaginable today, not least because I am now too heavy to go on some waterslides. At the time, I did think it was odd that he made me sit facing him.

The regulars were welcoming, but guarded. “You’re not going to start doing food, are you?” asked all the men who propped up the bar. “No,” said my dad. “We’re happy being just an ale house.”</p><p>I was a voracious reader and had recently raced my way through lots of historical novels by Norah Lofts which traced the fortunes of pubs through the ages, showing how the livelihoods of the landlords would be threatened by invasion, war, plague, the alteration of the route taken by the mail coach or the relocation of the market. There was no longer a market in Snaith, though we lived on Market Place and around the corner from Butter Market and Beast Fair, which seemed like good evidence of past glories. Down in the cellar, which was the oldest bit of the building and where the low ceilings spoke to times when everyone was shorter, I’d hope to see a friendly ghost who might help me make up plots for novels that featured barmaids through the centuries.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/28/gossips-snacks-and-the-odd-proposal-why-i-loved-growing-up-in-a-real-pub">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Labour leader’s ruthless dismissal of Corbynite Rebecca Long-Bailey was a defining moment for his leadership</p><p>It is often said that new political leaders have defining moments when they show their steel and stamp authority on their parties. Neil Kinnock’s epic confrontations with the Militant tendency in the 1980s were seen as the battles that won him his spurs, although he was ultimately unsuccessful in his efforts to make Labour electable. For Tony Blair, the decision to ditch clause IV in 1995 showcased New Labour as a force on the political centre ground, one that would go on to win three successive general elections.</p><p>This weekend a question many MPs are asking is whether<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/25/keir-starmer-sacks-rebecca-long-bailey-from-shadow-cabinet" title=""> Keir Starmer’s brutal sacking</a> on Thursday of Rebecca Long-Bailey, the standard bearer of the Corbynite left in the shadow cabinet, could go down as a defining act of his leadership. Could it be the moment when the brilliant lawyer became the ruthless potential prime minister capable of inspiring fear as well as respect, and of challenging the Tories at the next election? Or alternatively could it prove to be a moment when he split the party, angered much of the membership built up under Corbyn, and destroyed the very unity needed to take Labour forward?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/28/what-weve-learned-about-starmer-is-if-you-pick-a-fight-with-him-youll-lose">Continue reading...</a>

<p>She had to be reckless or obtuse not to see that this Labour leader will insist on zero tolerance for antisemitism<br /></p><p>During Keir Starmer’s campaign for the Labour leadership, one of the party’s most senior figures said to me that it was all very well to promise unity. “But unity around what?” The worry about Mr Starmer was that he might opt for a fudgy, phoney version of unity that sought to please every faction, including the hard leftists who brought Labour into such awful disrepute with the public. This isn’t durable as a long-term leadership strategy and it won’t convince the country that Labour is changing under new management. To do that, a less false kind of unity is required. This is the unity to be forged by purging all that was rotten and repulsive to voters about the discredited Corbynite regime, setting a fresh direction for Labour, rallying the party behind the new course and marginalising those who are unwilling or incapable of getting aboard.</p><p>We now have a clear indication that Mr Starmer wants unity, but on his terms. The signal was sent by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/25/keir-starmer-sacks-rebecca-long-bailey-from-shadow-cabinet">the dismissal</a> from the shadow cabinet of Rebecca Long-Bailey, the Corbynite standard bearer in the leadership contest, after she promoted a view that Mr Starmer held to be antisemitic. Her fellow travellers on the hard left are foaming that the sacking is a shocking disgrace. His admirers are hailing it as a steely act of ruthlessness by a brave leader. In truth, it was neither outrageous nor courageous. It was simply necessary. Mr Starmer had no choice but to fire her if he wanted to be taken seriously both by his friends and by his enemies and to convince the public that his Labour party will be very different to the one that they rejected by such a crushing margin back in December.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/28/starmers-sacking-of-long-bailey-was-vital-to-show-that-labour-is-changing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Leading black British poets including Linton Kwesi Johnson, Grace Nichols and Raymond Antrobus share their thoughts on protest, change and the trailblazers who inspired them. Introduction by Kadish Morris</p><p>Performance poetry revolutionised me. When I was 13, my mother invited me to a group called Leeds Young Authors, which she co-ran with founder and poet Khadijah Ibrahiim. Together, along with visiting poets, they ran writing workshops for teenagers. The selling point was that I would get the chance to travel to the US to compete in a poetry slam festival, but the excitement of getting on an aeroplane was soon overshadowed by what I can only describe as enlightenment. Poems performed at the festival taught me about police brutality, gentrification and climate change before I even owned a computer. Performance poetry immersed me in a world of critical thinking, but also, a community of black poets. I shared stages, shook hands and was taught by some of the greatest black British and African American poets before the age of 20. From Sonia Sanchez to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/17/saul-williams-hip-hop-interview">Saul Williams</a> to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/may/02/i-was-dehumanised-lemn-sissay-on-hearing-his-harrowing-abuse-report-live-on-stage">Lemn Sissay</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jackiekay">Jackie Kay</a>.</p><p>Black British history and literature are intrinsically connected. Poems such as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/linton-kwesi-johnson-brixton-windrush-myth-immigrants-didnt-want-fit-british-society-we-werent-allowed">Linton Kwesi Johnson</a>’s Five Nights of Bleeding explored the 1981 Brixton riots, while <a href="https://benjaminzephaniah.com/rhymin/the-death-of-joy-gardner/">Benjamin Zephaniah’s The Death of Joy Gardner</a> lamented on the killing of a Jamaican student who died in 1993 after being detained during a police immigration raid at her home. Literature was a forum for idea-sharing, community-building and support too. The Caribbean Artists Movement, founded by Barbadian poet Kamau Brathwaite, Trinidadian publisher John La Rose and Panamanian-Jamaican writer Andrew Salkey in London in 1966, set about promoting the work of marginalised Caribbean artists, writers and poets. More than 50 years later, black writers are yet to be fully absorbed into the mainstream.<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/may/24/british-poetry-scene-fails-diversity-test"> A 2018 study</a> found that only 7% of work published in poetry journals were by people from BAME backgrounds. Black voices have often felt like guests in UK literature, despite being routinely summoned during political events. “No one leaves home unless / home is the mouth of a shark” – a line from Home by the British-Somali poet Warsan Shire – was a prominent slogan <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/16/poets-speak-out-for-refugees-">of the migrant crisis in 2015</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/28/black-british-poets-black-lives-matter-linton-kwesi-johnson-grace-nichols-raymond-antrobus-kayo-chingonyi-malika-booker-vanessa-kisuule">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a booming market for Birkins, Baguettes and ‘Lux Anaconda’ shoes, the traditional auction houses are getting in on the act</p><p>If you’ve ever complained about the cost of new trainers, consider this. On Friday night, a pair of running shoes sold $162,500 (£132,000) at auction at Sotheby’s in New York. Though these unique spike shoes were handmade in the early 1970s by Bill Bowerman, co-founder of Nike, they’re not even the most expensive trainers in the world. Those were sold at Sotheby’s last month: a pair of Michael Jordan’s Air Jordan 1s from 1985 fetched $560,000 .</p><p>These sales are part of a growing trend for traditional auction houses to sell fashion and streetwear. Many now sell skateboards as well as Picassos, and are setting up handbag departments alongside those for antiquities and old masters.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/28/450k-for-trainers-why-vintage-fashion-is-the-new-smart-investment">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For photographer Dave Watts, it’s as if family life has gone back in time a little since the pandemic hit…<br /></p><p>During lockdown, family life has sometimes established a different time and space. Dave Watts took this photograph of his daughter Minna, five, on the daily walk he and his wife, Frances, a landscape artist, have taken with their three young children. Watts and his family live on the edge of a town in Somerset, where he works as a commercial photographer, but when jobs dried up in April and the kids were home from school the days took on a less predictable, sometimes magical shape, one he has tried to capture.</p><p>“There is a network of footpaths and we fell into doing the same route every day,” he says. “Probably about a mile and a half, always quite a leisurely pace. The children got into the habit of stopping in the same places to play. Because it was at the end of such a long dry spell, this place was dusty and Minna loved that; she throws herself into being busy and messy.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/jun/28/the-big-picture-girl-in-the-dust-somerset">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Getting a little tired of your own cooking? There are new ways round it, says Jay Rayner</p><p>The bleakest of crises can also gift us the most impressive of innovations. The Second World War gave us radar and rocket propulsion. This pandemic has given us… evolved restaurant food delivery. Oh, what a time to be alive and hankering after a bit of dinner. OK, it doesn’t enable airliners to avoid colliding and falling to earth in a devastating fireball. Nor does it empower us to reach the moon. But it does allow us to have a nice time. In the current circumstances, we should take it where we can get it.</p><p>Another review of takeaways? Not quite. I’m intrigued by the way restaurants that would never before have imagined their food being available to eat outside their premises have started to innovate. Consider it an act of business rehabilitation, a kind of economic physio to get the body moving again. Clearly it requires thought and care. Ravinder Bhogal of <a href="https://www.jikonilondon.com/" title="">Jikoni</a> in London’s Marylebone has put an awful lot of thought and care into it.
