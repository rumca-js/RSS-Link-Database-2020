Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory and Madden NFL 21 have been announced. Plus, here's why the PS5 is so big. 

A new Kingdom Hearts spin-off called Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory has been announced with a trailer from Square Enix. It's a rhythm-based game set to some of the greatest hits of the series. In other game announcements, Madden NFL 21 is coming in August with new features, gameplay improvements, a single-player campaign, and more. 

You may have noticed that the PS5 is huge, and now we know the reason why. According to one Sony official, there's a clear explanation. However, there might be other reasons for the large size.

GameSpot is currently hosting Play For All, a summer gaming celebration and charity event featuring special guests like Kinda Funny, What's Good Games, Funhaus, and many familiar GameSpot faces.

EA has officially announced Star Wars: Squadrons. The new game from Motive Studios is an “immersive, first-person space dog fighting experience” that follows an original story with a new cast of characters, plus cameos from characters like Wedge Antilles and Hera Syndulla.

PlayStation 5 was announced last week, and we still have no idea what it's going to cost. PlayStation boss Jim Ryan said, however, that Sony is focused on "value opposed to price." Speaking of next gen, there's more details on Xbox Series X's Smart Delivery initiative. 

Here's how much we think the PlayStation 5 will cost: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-price-heres-how-much-we-think-sonys-latest-con/1100-6477901/

Here's a list of Xbox games with Smart Delivery: https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-smart-delivery-games-features-detail/1100-6478490/

Fame is the key to victory in Humankind. Traditionally 4X strategy games have been won through military conquest, cultural growth, and scientific discovery among others.

But in Humankind all these historical deeds earn players Era Stars, allowing your culture to develop and grow. Fame will be awarded for every great deed a player accomplishes, culminating in a singular victory condition.

Humankind is releasing in 2021, although we do not have an exact release date yet. Until then we will be sure to bring you any news on the development of Amplitude Studios' next entry into the 4X genre.
