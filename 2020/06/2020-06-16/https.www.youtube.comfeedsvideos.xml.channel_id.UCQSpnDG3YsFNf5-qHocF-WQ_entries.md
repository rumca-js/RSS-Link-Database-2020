OLED TVs are still the king of image quality and contrast because of the self-lit nature of the panel. This video reviews one of LG's new 2020 4K OLED TVs, the model OLED65GX (the 65" size of the GX series). The G stands for gallery, because this model is made specifically to be wall mounted, and therefore only includes a wall mount. A stand can be bought separately however. Overall the TV obviously looks amazing, especially because of the AI Upscaling thanks to LG's new "Alpha 9 Gen 3" processor, which I think is truly able to make some high quality 1080p content look like legitimate 4K. It also has a ton of future-proofing features such as 4K resolution with 120 Hz native refresh rate, and HDMI 2.1 . Be sure to watch the video where I talk about way more features and details.

DISCLOSURES: LG did provide me with this TV to honestly review - I did not buy it. But they didn't pay me any money to review it. All opinions are my own.
