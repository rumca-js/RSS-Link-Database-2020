Your friends had nothing but good stuff to say about you and described you as top of your class. You were a self-proclaimed \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d. But like many life-long warfighters, when your time in the military was up, you\u2019re left with the challenge of finding your place in society. That challenge came with troubling money problems.\n\nFast forward to March 2019, and the US announced that they\u2019re indicting Venezuela\u2019s very sketchy \u201cPresident\u201d, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, along with his cronies on charges of money laundering etc\n\nYou had been conveniently awarded a very fat contract to take down Maduro from his arch nemesis, Juan Guaid\u00f3. This contract was for a very respectable $1.5m retainer and $213m in future payoffs. A lot of money.\n\nwhen that deal feel through, this became the get rich quick money making scheme you need.\n\nIf you\u2019re gonna overthrow a government, you\u2019re gonna need some help - so it\u2019s time to recruit your all-star team. One of these soldiers that you teamed up with was a guy named Cliver Alcal\u00e1. A retired general in the Venezuelan army. He's got a lot of connections, knows the lay of the land, and can give this coup a lot of power behind it.\n\nWith you and the general teamed up, it\u2019s time to put together the soldiers. Sketchy general, hungry untrained soldiers, lack of equipment\u2026Not the SEAL Team 6 you were hoping for, but for the money, status, and freedom? We\u2019ll make it work!\n\nCodenamed \u201cOperation Gideon\u201d. Ideally, your invasion would spark a popular rebellion in the locals to help you along the way. Maduro will be in Florida to face prosecution, You\u2019ll get your money to pay off all your debts and to make you a pretty rich man, And you\u2019ll be hailed as the man who single handedly orchestrated the modern day revolution of Venezuela. Reality, however, was different.\n\nLeading up to the invasion, more defectors were being recruited into the camps even if the money and equipment wasn\u2019t arriving, and you were training them. Almost in an instant - the house of cards fell down. But there\u2019s still a silver lining in this mess - the US also just put a $15m bounty on Maduro. \n\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
