If you want to keep your projects on your own server or website, without using Github or Gitlab or a similar site, it's actually extremely easily. In this video, I set up a git server on my website at git.lukesmith.xyz. It is easy and doesn't really cause any bandwidth strain or other issues. Later, I'll be adding on a GUI html interface called stagit.

If you don't trust YouTube's "community guidelines" and Netflix Original features and MSNBC to raise the coming generation the right way, you're going to have to pitch in yourself.

We looked at the data and saw that Zoomers are in trouble. We need more of that child-like play to keep us away from disaster. Oh and the media? Tell them not to worry about money...
