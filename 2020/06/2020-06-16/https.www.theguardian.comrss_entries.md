Not this one.</p><p>As Buffy the Vampire Slayer settles into a new home on All4, the Syfy channel needs a different lure for audiences unsatisfied with endless reruns of Star Trek: Voyager. Auditioning for that role is Spides, an original commission, set in Berlin, with an English-language script, credited to the German showrunner Rainer Matsutani and featuring a cast of German, American and indeed German-American actors. The result is often clunky. But then sci-fi’s B-movie heritage means it can get away with a certain amount of clunk … right?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/16/spides-review-flop-international-cooperation-syfy">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Sixties pop singer who had a No 1 hit with Tell Laura I Love Her</p><p>It is now hard to appreciate the national outcry over Ricky Valance’s record Tell Laura I Love Her in the summer of 1960. It told of a young boy who entered a stock-car race because he wanted the prize money to get married. He crashed and his final words were, “Tell Laura I love her”. It was maudlin and clumsily written, but Valance’s vocal made it sound better than it was, and the song reached No 1 in the UK charts, despite restricted play by the BBC.</p><p>At the time, many adults were troubled by teenage music and disliked the morbid fascination of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HIHdCJA8f8">Tell Laura I Love Her</a>. The song was followed by other “death discs”: the Everly Brothers’ Ebony Eyes (about a plane crash), the Shangri-las’ Leader of the Pack and Twinkle’s Terry (both motorcycle accidents). Not to be outdone, Valance, who has died aged 84, then recorded <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zMkq9WtVAUs">Bobby</a> (1961), about a girl who had lost the will to live, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atzldTr7hvM">Six Boys</a> (1965), about the pallbearers at a girlfriend’s funeral.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/16/ricky-valance-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Inside spaces reopened this week, but it’s the relaxed rules on outdoor terraces that bar and restaurant owners feel will create a quintessentially Parisian summer vibe</p><p>On a normal weekend, rue d’Aligre, near Place de la Bastille in Paris’s 12th arrondissement, is lined with raucous fruit and vegetable stalls and packed with shoppers and tourists heading for the historic Marché d’Aligre at its northern end. But now the stalls of the covered market are gone – they’ve moved to the open square in front of the food hall for easier social distancing – and the street’s bistro and bar owners are busy setting out tables and chairs on the pavement and in parking places.</p><p>Until President Macron’s new announcement on 14 June of the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/15/france-turning-page-as-schools-borders-and-workplaces-reopen-emmanuel-macron-coronavirus"> opening up all of France from 15 June </a>, Paris was classed as a <em>zone orange</em>, which meant restaurants and cafes could only serve customers outside.

<p>Embracing streaming was a step in the right direction, but the calendar shift has given distributors an extra two months to get their big-ticket releases into cinemas</p><p>The most recent Academy Awards ceremony took place on 9 February, the earliest date in the institution’s 92-year history, as a calendar-shifting experiment that was largely not embraced by the industry. If everyone was happy enough with the outcome – which saw Bong Joon-ho’s Parasite make history as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar">first non-English-language film ever to win </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar">best </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/feb/10/parasite-first-foreign-language-film-to-win-best-picture-oscar">picture</a> – complaints were rife in Hollywood about the compressed season leading to it. Voters grumbled about not having enough time to see the films, publicists were run ragged juggling a concentrated schedule of red carpet events and interviews, and even Bong admitted to being <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/03/bong-joon-ho-kelly-reichardt-parasite-first-cow/607360/?fbclid=IwAR2ROKGMD3e43lgIEvvOam1Kl_Hadw1fW7cRtbY37ZdstWfcFuu3J0tggGk">“a shell of a human”</a> at the end of his triumphant but intense campaign trail.</p><p>Well, be careful what you wish for. Next year’s Oscar ceremony will indeed take place later: a full two-and-a-half months later, in fact, as the Academy announced yesterday that, to accommodate a cinema release schedule stopped short by the Covid-19 pandemic, the whole shindig has been shifted to 25 April 2021. Whereas eligibility for the Oscars is usually determined by the calendar year, this season will make a one-off exception: titles released in the US between 1 January 2020 and 28 February 2021 will be able to compete for the next awards, giving voters a 14-month window of films to choose from.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/16/oscars-2021-how-shifting-the-awards-later-favours-the-old-guard">Continue reading...</a>

## William Gibson: 'I'm always striving not to be noticed'

<p>The sci-fi novelist on how he inspired the creation of a fashion line – and his nerdy fascination with military fatigues</p><p>I became interested in clothing while growing up in a very small town in the southern US. I was an isolated kid, I wasn’t interested in sports, but in junior high it struck me that people communicated who they wanted you to think they were with what they were wearing. I developed a sort of anthropological mindset around it. I started looking at how clothes were sold to us, the narratives attached to everything, through advertising: “Wear this and be this.” That stuck with me.</p><p>In this photograph, everything I am wearing is by <a href="https://acrnm.com/">Acronym</a>, a brand designed by my friend Errolson Hugh. It’s fantastically comfortable and functional. Putting it on cheers me up: it’s like suddenly my house has been improved and I know everything will work. It’s all interoperative, so, for instance, you can unzip the back of the jacket and wear the bag underneath. Or, on another model, a zipper allows you to remove the jacket while wearing a seat belt. It’s not so much that I would ever need to do that, but I love the idea that it’s possible.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/16/william-gibson-im-always-striving-not-to-be-noticed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Many stylists and barbers are secretly working to keep us groomed during the pandemic, despite it being against the rules. But who are their clients – and aren’t they worried about spreading coronavirus?</p><p>The women come with their hair already wet. The men have soft fuzz trailing down their necks, like the asphalt of a tropical runway that has turned to grass. Surreptitiously, they duck into residential houses or barber shops with newspapered windows. They emerge pristine: women with bouffant blow-dries and men with edges so precise you could take a ruler to them. They are clients of the illegal hairdressers of lockdown – and there are more of them than you may think.</p><p>Officially, of course, no one is supposed to be getting their hair cut. Not professionally, at least. Since lockdown began in England, on 23 March, hairdressers and barbers have been closed. Many in the sector are gearing up for a 4 July reopening, although this has not yet been confirmed by the government. Wales looks likely to be the same day; 11 August has been mooted in Scotland; Northern Ireland is yet to set a date. Social media is full of videos of people attacking their own hair with kitchen scissors, with varying degrees of success.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/16/cut-and-run-the-underground-hairdressers-of-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Much progress has been made in attitudes towards sexual equality and gender identity – but in many places a dramatic backlash by conservative forces has followed. By Mark Gevisser</p><p>On a visit to Senegal in 2013, Barack Obama held a press conference with the Senegalese president Macky Sall. “Mr President,” asked an American journalist, “did you press President Sall to make sure that homosexuality is decriminalised in Senegal? And, President Sall,” the journalist continued, “as this country’s new president, sir, will you work to decriminalise homosexuality?”</p><p>The question was inevitable: the previous day, while they were flying over the Atlantic, Obama and his staff had erupted into cheers when they heard that the US supreme court had overturned the Defense of Marriage Act, paving the way for same-sex marriage across the country. The president had issued a statement from Air Force One: “The laws of our land are catching up to the fundamental truth that millions of Americans hold in our hearts: when all Americans are treated as equal, no matter who they are or whom they love, we are all more free.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/16/how-globalisation-has-transformed-the-fight-for-lgbtq-rights">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As protests erupted throughout the US, Donald Trump posted incendiary comments to social media. While Twitter hid the president’s post, Facebook took no action. The Guardian’s Alex Hern looks at what happened next</p><p>The killing of George Floyd at the hands of a US police department outraged the country and prompted protest movements across the US and then the world. As Donald Trump witnessed scenes of disorder, he did what he often does: fired off some comments on Twitter, which were cross-posted to Facebook. After condemning protesters he signed off with an ominous threat “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”. </p><p>It left the two social media companies with a dilemma: how to handle such provocative words from the US president. Twitter hid the tweet behind a message outlining an infringement of its guidelines.
