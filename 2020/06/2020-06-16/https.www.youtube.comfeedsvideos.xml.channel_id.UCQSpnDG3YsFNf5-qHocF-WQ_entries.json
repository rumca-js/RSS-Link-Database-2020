This video reviews one of LG's new 2020 4K OLED TVs, the model OLED65GX (the 65\" size of the GX series). The G stands for gallery, because this model is made specifically to be wall mounted, and therefore only includes a wall mount. A stand can be bought separately however. Overall the TV obviously looks amazing, especially because of the AI Upscaling thanks to LG's new \"Alpha 9 Gen 3\" processor, which I think is truly able to make some high quality 1080p content look like legitimate 4K. It also has a ton of future-proofing features such as 4K resolution with 120 Hz native refresh rate, and HDMI 2.1 . Be sure to watch the video where I talk about way more features and details.\n\nDISCLOSURES: LG did provide me with this TV to honestly review - I did not buy it. But they didn't pay me any money to review it. All opinions are my own.\n\n\u21d2 Become a channel member for exclusive features!
