The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

This is the most adorable thing you may see all day.Hamilton Leithauser has gathered his father, his daughters, his wife and two nieces for a family affair that warmed my heart. Known best as the The Walkmen singer, Hamilton Leithauser plays songs from his 2020 solo album, appropriately titled The Loves of Your Life, while the children sing backup and dance on haystacks. Joy exudes. And there's not just one Tiny Desk in the shot — look closely for a second tinier one. Happy Father's Day, everyone.
