<p>Here’s how to minimise the impact of the pandemic on young people</p><p>For weeks, child poverty campaigners have been warning the government that as a result of the pandemic, poor children would be more likely than ever to go hungry this summer. For weeks, the government refused to commit to spending the modest amount it would take to avoid 1.3 million children not having enough food to eat in one of the richest countries in the world. Disgracefully, it was not concern for basic child welfare that propelled Boris Johnson to change his mind last week, but fears of a political backlash after the footballer Marcus Rashford championed the call for change.</p><p>The manner in which Johnson was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/16/boris-johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-marcus-rashfords-school-meals-call">forced into this </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/16/boris-johnson-faces-tory-rebellion-over-marcus-rashfords-school-meals-call">U-turn </a>brings into even sharper focus the lack of moral fibre and the ineptitude that has characterised the government’s handling of the pandemic. Coronavirus is the biggest threat to child wellbeing in a generation, yet the government appears to have no plan.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/20/the-observer-view-on-a-manifesto-for-change-as-a-generation-of-britains-children-faces-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>There are plenty of obstacles ahead but counties are optimistic about a return to action this summer</p><p>When Vikram Solanki takes his first training session as the head coach of Surrey on Monday morning, he will be giving his players red balls to use. This was not an entirely straightforward decision since Solanki and all the other coaches around the country do not know how the county cricket schedule is going to look from August. “We’re hoping to know soon enough,” he says, “but at the start we decided we should go back to basics with a red ball.”</p><p>There are no guarantees about this summer’s domestic cricket but most agree with Solanki when he says: “I would love there to be four-day cricket alongside an element of T20 cricket. I know there is a lot of work going on about that.” Richard Gould, the chief executive of Surrey, Tim Bostock of Durham, Rob Andrew of Sussex, and Lisa Pursehouse of Nottinghamshire have been charged with exploring every possibility. “That’s what the members would like and we will make every effort to play red-ball as well as white-ball cricket. Ideally, the games would have first-class status and they would be competitive.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/20/streams-spinners-and-bubbles-counties-ponder-all-options-for-restart">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Having a baby lay somewhere in the future. Until suddenly, after a night in a Hollywood hotel, it didn’t</p><p>I hadn’t meant to have a baby at all. I hadn’t meant <em>not</em> to have a baby either, by which I mean I always thought I’d have children one day. I just thought those children would grow up with me and their yet-to-materialise father in a lovely farmhouse, hugged by the hills, with an Aga and a dog and long, invigorating walks through the fields. This was not how I had grown up in Yorkshire, but it wasn’t a million miles from it either. It was an idealised version of home, and it lived somewhere vaguely in my future as an unspecified certainty.</p><p>Exactly how I thought La Vida Farmhouse was going to appear when I was, in fact, living in a one-bedroom rented apartment in West Hollywood in 2010 isn’t clear. My apartment was just behind the Sunset Strip part of Sunset Boulevard. The Strip is the glamorously cheesy bit, full of rooftop pools and famous people, and it was a place that encouraged in me a relationship with reality that could at best be described as negligible. I was working as a journalist, interviewing Hollywood celebrities for newspapers and magazines back home.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/20/got-pregnant-by-mistake-single-motherhood">Continue reading...</a>

Was it the one that I followed across the hill behind Gabi Wagner’s house near Tromsø in northern Norway at midnight on a midsummer’s day?</p><p>I had gone out for a walk. Another walk – because it is light all the time at that time in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2018/sep/02/5-best-norwegian-holidays-chosen-by-locals-norway-islands-mountains">Troms County</a> and there seems no reason not to be up and out in it as long as it lasts. And it lasts long. It lasts so long that lasting is not what it does. The light, plainly, <em>is</em>. Elsewhere, and at other times, days might be where we live, but for three months of the Arctic year there are no days, or rather there is just one long day, and everything lives in its light.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/20/midsummer-birding-in-arctic-northern-norway-birds-migrate-africa">Continue reading...</a>
