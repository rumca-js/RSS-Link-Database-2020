<p>Marta Zaraska’s book debunks some of the myths of longevity and suggests how to really live a long life – from avoiding loneliness to eating with others</p><p>When her daughter was born, Marta Zaraska was determined that nothing but the best would do. “Goji berries, chia seeds, kale: I was going crazy scouring the shops for the healthiest food,” she says. “All these things that I thought would make sure she lived to be 100.” And then it occurred to her that how we live our lives might be more important than the latest miracle food or exercise gadget. Being a science journalist with a training in law, however, she wanted proof.</p><p>She began looking through hundreds of academic papers and interviewing scores of researchers about extreme experiments with mice and monkeys, and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2019-05-zombie-cells-buildup-body-role.html">scary biological phenomena such as zombie cells</a> (AKA senescent cells, the bloated, not-quite dead matter that accumulates as we age, belching out toxins and turning other cells into zombies). Her research expanded beyond the scientific, taking in a Portuguese longevity bootcamp, a Polish hugging salon and a flower-pressing session for Japanese octogenarians before circling back to France, home to the world’s oldest certified centenarian.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/21/optimism-friendship-and-tidy-socks-the-secret-to-living-to-100">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our photojournalists explain how the pandemic has changed their practice – and why physical distancing is no barrier to producing intimate portraits </p><p>Throughout the pandemic it has been important to show our readers and viewers what’s happening in the world outside, to make a historical document and to chart the progress of those on the frontline. During the first weeks, it was difficult to gain access to hospitals to see how they were coping – until photojournalist Jonny Weeks was invited on to the Covid-19 wards at University hospital in Coventry. We made a full risk assessment, considering his safety and the risk to those around him, and with the guidance of the staff there he produced a brilliant photo essay. He was one of the very first photojournalists to have this kind of access in the UK and it was a key story for the Guardian.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/jun/21/picture-a-pandemic-how-guardian-photographers-adapted-to-lockdown-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The musician talks about missing Glastonbury, being inspired by Abigail’s Party and turning the tables on music critics</p><p>Nadine Shah, 34, was born in South Tyneside to a British-Norwegian mother and British-Pakistani father. Since her 2013 debut, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/21/nadine-shah-dum-mad-review">Love Your Dum and Mad</a></em>, her albums have explored mental health, Islamophobia, the refugee crisis and feminism through post-punk, gothic pop, and her blackly comic personality. <em><a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nadine-shah-holiday-destination/">Holiday Destination</a></em> (2018) was nominated for the Mercury prize, and her fourth album, <em>Kitchen Sink</em>, is out 26 June.<br /><strong><br />What’s it like releasing an album in the time of Covid-19?<br /></strong>It’s strange, and I’m sad, obviously, as I was really looking forward to playing live to support it. I had a great slot at Glastonbury, this massive dream, on a great stage at a great time, and the idea of all those people who could have come to see me, or chanced upon me, not happening… I don’t want to think about, really. But being stuck at home means I’ve got social media at my fingertips, and I’ve been seeing who’s reacting to my songs. Lots of people have been tweeting about my singles. That’s been great.<br /><br /><strong>How are you finding lockdown?<br /></strong>I’m glad I’m in Ramsgate by the sea, where I live with my boyfriend, but I miss my band. We’ve all been on WhatsApp giving each other advice about emergency grants and musicians’ funds. I’m also sick of celebrities tweeting at us from their huge gardens reminding us to breathe, going [dreamy American accent] “this is the time to learn Italian, to do your sabbatical”. For most people, managing to maintain relationships and friendships and not bursting into tears all the time is enough, love.</p><p><strong>You tweeted recently that you got 20,000 copies of </strong><em><strong>Kitchen Sink</strong></em><strong> sent to your flat to sign for your fans, instead of 200. What happened?<br /></strong>It was hilarious, not that my boyfriend thought so at 6.30am when there was a lorry driver at our door. I was pretending to be asleep [laughs]. There were actually only 8,000 when I counted them, but looking at all those records was interesting, thinking: “I’ve made this, I’m really proud of it, but how much money that people pay for it will actually come back to me?” Hardly anything. It made me want to sell them off the balcony! They’ve gone back to Germany now, though. We can get into our living room again.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/21/nadine-shah-im-sick-of-celebrities-in-their-huge-gardens-telling-us-to-breathe">Continue reading...</a>

## Blundering Boris: how U-turns and broken promises have split the Tories

<p>From backtracking on free school meals to lack of planning over Covid-19, many backbenchers are in despair. But what now for the future of No 10?</p><p>After another terrible week for the government that saw two more screeching U-turns and warnings from Tory backbenchers of mounting discontent in the ranks, a former cabinet minister from Theresa May’s time as prime minister had this to say. “If we were in normal times you would be hearing talk by now about removing the prime minister. It is that bad. But you don’t get rid of leaders in a crisis like this.”</p><p>The same Tory MP said that a batch of cabinet ministers including education secretary Gavin Williamson also deserved to be sacked and that the No 10 operation was “totally dysfunctional”. There were so many decisions of crucial importance in the fight against Covid-19 that had to be referred up the chain of command to Downing Street that its hugely inexperienced staff – many of whom were more used to running campaigns than the country - were simply unable to cope.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/21/blundering-boris-how-u-turns-and-broken-promises-have-split-the-tories">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Five wealthy women about to turn 40 rethink their lives in the wake of #MeToo in a caustic reimagining of a 60s classic</p><p>It takes a certain insouciance to write a novel about a group of Oxford graduates reminiscing about their Pimm’s-drinking student days in the current climate. Who really wants to peer into the hearts of privileged white women called things like Priss and Helena who employ Bulgarian cleaners and insist on calling themselves “middle class” when they surely mean upper middle class? It’s not as if this substrata of society has been under-represented in literary fiction.</p><p>However, <a href="http://www.larafeigel.com/about-lara/">Lara Feigel</a> is quite aware of what she is doing – a homemade elderflower muffin, which appears on the first page, is carefully chosen. She is prepared to court dislike in her pursuit of the emotional truth of these women’s lives. As her omniscient narrator, Stella, reflects: “Perhaps that’s the biggest problem of being middle class and white and English and a woman, finding it embarrassing to take ourselves seriously. I’d have done so much more with my life if I hadn’t felt embarrassed.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/21/the-group-by-lara-feigel-review-female-friendship-and-anger">Continue reading...</a>

Each Saturday night she visits the vast Tesco Extra on Sheffield’s Savile Street to collect surplus food on behalf of the Norfolk Park Tenants and Residents Association. It’s then redistributed to about 100 people in need through a community pantry scheme run out of a local church. “Normally there will be eight to 10 trays waiting for us,” she says. “Fresh fruit, veg, eggs, bread, a full mix.” That Saturday there were no fresh vegetables at all. There really wasn’t much of anything. “There were just two trays. The manager was very upset. He said the shop had been stripped bare so there wasn’t any surplus.”</p><p>In London, at the Deptford headquarters of FareShare, the charity which redistributes food from throughout the supply chain that would otherwise go to waste, the story was becoming horribly familiar. As well as receiving deliveries direct from supermarkets and producers into their warehouses, FareShare has 7,000 affiliated charities across the country – food banks, community kitchens and the like – which, as with the Norfolk Park group , collect surplus direct from individual branches. But those supermarkets suddenly had nothing to give. “Almost overnight these charities had their supply cut off at the knees,” says the chief executive, Lindsay Boswell. “There was nothing we could do.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/21/from-panic-buying-to-food-banks-how-britain-fed-itself-in-the-first-phase-of-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Avoiding jaywalkers is an art form in a tourist hotspot like York, all the more so when attempting to socially distance</p><p>When you live in Ye Olde Heritage Destinationne, you develop a particular way of moving through space. The narrow streets of my home town, York, are usually thronged with tour group crocodiles, uproarious hens brandishing inflatable phalluses, swishy cloaked Ghost Walk guides and packs of Viking raiders window-shopping at Primark. You’re never safe from weary Instagram boyfriends snapping their partners in front of the cholera burial ground or 20 people joining arms to sway along as a busker murders Ed Sheeran (not literally).</p><p>l learned tourist-evasion parkour early: dodging, weaving and sidestepping are second nature. I’m a terrible driver (I once drove into a skip, unprovoked) but a skilled pedestrian, predicting from 100 yards who will stop dead for free fudge samples or veer wildly to examine some decorative drinking horns and course-correcting to avoid them. My defensive walking is no different from the ways anyone living in a big city moves, really, just with more wooden broadswords.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/21/emma-beddington-time-to-test-drive-our-covid-aware-pedestrian-skills">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is an airline pilot in peril in a claustrophobic hijack movie that unfolds in near-real time</p><p>Perched uneasily between the melodrama of 70s disaster movies such as the <em>Airport</em> series and the more sober horrors of Paul Greengrass’s 9/11 drama <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/jun/04/features.review27">United 93</a></em>, this lean hijack thriller marks a striking feature debut for German writer/director Patrick Vollrath. Having earned an Oscar nomination for his 2015 short film <em>Alles wird gut </em>(<em>Everything Will Be Okay</em>)<em>, </em>Vollrath demonstrates a slick technical ability tinged with a mainstream arthouse sensibility (he studied under Michael Haneke) that may well land him more spectacular commissions in the future.</p><p>Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Tobias, an American co-pilot flying a commercial airliner from Berlin to Paris. Onboard the plane, along with a full load of passengers, are flight attendant Gökce (Aylin Tezel), with whom Tobias has a young child, and a group of hijackers, first observed on thrummingly silent airport surveillance cameras, making their way through security. When the hijackers storm the cockpit shortly after takeoff, the captain (pilot turned actor Carlo Kitzlinger) is seriously injured and Tobias finds himself locked in the control booth – with Gökce on the other side of the door and the attackers threatening to kill passengers unless he lets them in.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/21/7500-review-hijack-cockpit-drama-patrick-vollrath-joseph-gordon-levitt">Continue reading...</a>

## From the Band to Beyoncé: concert films to fill the live music black hole

<p>Ahead of what would have been Glastonbury weekend, we pick the documentaries that best recreate the magic of gigs and festivals</p><p>You don’t know what you’ve got till it’s gone. Since live music in the UK entered suspended animation on 16 March, even the most mundane aspects of gig-going have acquired an exotic tang. While revisiting the concert movies below, I found myself gazing longingly at arena corridors, stadium loading bays and festival burger vans, let alone musicians and crowds. I get giddy at the thought of watching a mediocre band play an early afternoon slot on the third stage of a minor festival. The noise, the spectacle, the people, the ritual of it. Spirit me to a performance by someone I genuinely love and I might faint.</p><p>This is live music’s lost summer: a packed calendar wiped clean in one swoop. The festival season is a black hole. Shows that were optimistically shunted back to autumn have now been kicked into 2021. The concert industry is worth more than $30bn a year, so its temporary disappearance is economically devastating for musicians and worse still for road crews, stage designers, caterers, venue staff and so on. For punters the loss is more intangible: an absence of joyful new memories; the phantom sense of what might have been. Every week my Google calendar tells me about another great night out that I should be having. Next weekend was meant to be Glastonbury. So much for that.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/21/from-the-band-to-beyonce-concert-films-to-fill-the-live-music-black-hole">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Kristin Scott Thomas can thank lockdown for one thing: it’s made her stay put. But now she is craving the bright lights and buzz of a film set…</p><p>If you went for a stroll in Rutland during the early days of lockdown, enjoying your daily dose of exercise in England’s tiniest county, you might have been interrupted by the sight of a strange woman ranting about her antiques shop and a dying neighbour. It was Kristin Scott Thomas, rehearsing her lines for an Alan Bennett <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/02/comedy-tragedy-elegy-why-alan-bennetts-home-truths-are-perfect-for-our-times" title="">Talking Heads</a></em> monologue hurriedly commissioned by the BBC when production on other shows had to stop. Nicholas Hytner, former director of the National Theatre, has revived the series of one-actor plays, in which Scott Thomas plays Celia, a woman approaching retirement age with a struggling business and an accidentally cunning plan for how to make some cash.</p><p>“The script was quite difficult to learn, actually, so I’d go on very long walks, and anyone coming across me in the lanes here would find me shouting with a piece of paper in my hand. Or people would roll down the car windows: ‘Are you lost dear?’ Did they recognise me? Oh I don’t think so – I’m not sure I have much of a fanbase in Rutland,” says Scott Thomas with a wry smile. Or rather, with a Kristin Scott Thomas smile, the one that suggests that the actor has been in on a magnificent joke for much of her 60 years, and that it hasn’t stopped being discreetly amusing yet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/21/kristin-scott-thomas-alan-bennett-monologues-lockdown-i-want-action-camels-600-extras">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An Australian family takes to the sea in search of a modern idyll, in Alex Vaughan’s award-winning photo</p><p>In 2016, Steve and Beccie Soetekouw sold their farm on Tasmania, bought a 43ft yacht and, with no boating experience, set off to sail around the world with their 10 children. Photographer Alex Vaughan took this picture – a winner at this year’s <a href="https://www.openwalls.co/">OpenWalls Arles awards</a> – off Chinamans Beach in Sydney in 2018, where the family’s boat was moored. The Soetekouws had by then been two years at sea and were celebrating the arrival of a baby girl, Squeak, who was three days old.</p><p>Vaughan had heard about the family from a friend and rowed out to see them, ending up talking for a couple of hours to Beccie, “while all the kids patiently listened, chiming in occasionally with thoughtful comments and questions, the little ones climbing over the big ones. No devices, no distractions - I had never seen kids as calm and engaged for that period of time.” Vaughan ended up documenting their life on the water over 12 months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/jun/21/the-big-picture-voyage-of-discovery-sydney-2018">Continue reading...</a>

Designed by Dom, the school’s owner, its idea is to equip people with the skills to be safe and self-sufficient in open water.

There is a blank doorway here and next to it a small, polished brass plaque. It reads “Joe Allen”. I pause here for a moment, just to draw out my youthful anticipation. When I push through that door, I will be hit by an adrenaline rush of a noise. It’s a sound of which I want to become a part: a babble of happy voices deep into their theatrical anecdotage, overlaid by the clink of glass on glass, the rattle of the cocktail shaker, and all of it underscored by Jimmy Hardwick’s piano.</p><p>Tayyabs is literally managed chaos.
