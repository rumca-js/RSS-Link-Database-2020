"NOOOOOOO!!! I don't want to read the manuals and documentation you wrote for me! If you don't explain this to me in brainlet terms RIGHT NOW, you're an ELITIST! WOW the Linux community is SO TOXIC because you dare to assume that you know more than me just because I categorically refuse to learn anything via the methods you have painstakingly made for me. You just wait until I open 10 Github issues and 20 forum treads on this basic question that has already been asked hundreds of times. You better continue to cater to me no matter how arrogant I get or you're an ELITIST!"
