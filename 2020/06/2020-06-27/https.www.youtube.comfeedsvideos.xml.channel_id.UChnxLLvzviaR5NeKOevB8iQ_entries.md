Late-night session that will never get posted unless I just post it today.

Patch notes: 
Morphagene is getting funky gates for playback and shift from the 4ms clock divider being fed Euclidian stuff from Pamela's New Workout with a fair amount of RSkip happening to introduce uncertainty.

I've got an envelope from Pam's New Workout sliding the varispeed around on Morphagene for a tape effect, and swapping around genes and morph to get different feelings. 

Bass is 0-Coast, other voices are Piston Honda III, Pico Voice, Plaits (which is doing the sort of steel drum sound) and a little pit of Pico System III doing that high simple triangle arp line. All of that is being sequenced by the Hermod.

Drums from the vpme QD drum module, with a fair amount of modulation, including a gate with a big width set to change the decay of the snare every few bars. Key Step Pro is sequencing the drums, and I use the mutes on the QD and the fill buttons on the KSP for performance effects.

Because the KSP is clocking the ADE-32 for modulation, when I use fills on the KSP it temporarily messes up the clocking on the ADE-32 and makes the modulation rates change in interesting ways.

Finally, the After Later Monsoon (a MI Clouds clone) is getting fed ramps from ADE-32 to modulate everything on it, and I am playing around with the sliders on the fly to get crazy glitch effects.
