<p>After the Run the Jewels rapper’s impassioned speech about the death of George Floyd went viral, he and his partner El-P explain why a mix of serious politics and surreal goofiness makes their music perfect for our times</p><p>Run the Jewels have enjoyed one of the more improbable rises to fame in recent hip-hop history. Two figures nearing 40, from the genre’s margins – Killer Mike on the fringes of Outkast’s Atlanta-based circle of rappers and producers, his partner El-P a founder member of Company Flow and longstanding critical darling of east coast underground rap – who pooled their resources to record a mixtape. They gave it away and watched, astonished, as it and its two successors became runaway successes.</p><p>It happened despite the fact that their music – political, angry, more about lyrics than hooks – is grounded in the golden age hip-hop of Public Enemy and EPMD, and swims against the genre’s prevalent trends. Yet for all they profess a certain mystification over Run the Jewels’ success, it’s hard to avoid the feeling that they’re the right band for the moment: an alternately surreal and furious response to a world spinning bizarrely, horribly out of control.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/01/run-the-jewels-i-want-the-oppressors-to-know-that-they-havent-created-complete-hopelessness">Continue reading...</a>

## Boxer Sam Cox: 'I've delivered around 15,000 NHS meals personally'

<p>The young boxer has been busy repaying his personal debt to the NHS while boxing is suspended due to the pandemic, including to nurses who treated his mother before she died of cancer last year<br /></p><p>“When you finish every day it’s an amazing feeling,” Sam Cox says late one afternoon after he has helped deliver the latest batch of meals to NHS workers.&nbsp;Cox, <a href="https://boxrec.com/en/proboxer/799202">a professional boxer with a&nbsp;5-0 record</a>, has had to put his promising career on hold during the Covid crisis. But he now moves relentlessly from hospitals to health centres with his mass deliveries.</p><p>The 26-year-old looks exhausted but quietly elated as he reflects on work which, amid adversity and tragedy, has such personal meaning. “By the end of last week we’d done 40,000 meals,” Cox says. “I’ve delivered around 15,000 meals personally. Probably more. In a normal job you finish work and think: ‘Aarrghhh, at least that’s over.’ But when you finish this you think you’ve actually done something. It makes me especially proud when I am bringing food to the district nurses at the Goodinge health centre [in Islington, north London]. Two or three were in my house most days changing my mum’s medication and looking after her when she was so sick.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/01/boxer-sam-cox-ive-delivered-around-15000-nhs-meals-personally">Continue reading...</a>

## As the George Floyd protests continue, let's be clear where the violence is coming from

<p>Using damage to property as cover, US police have meted out shocking, indiscriminate brutality in the wake of the uprising</p><p>The word “violence” is going to be used a lot to describe the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/30/protests-spread-across-us-in-response-to-george-floyd-killing-video">events in US cities over the weekend</a> and all this week. So it’s going to be important to be clear about who is violent and what violence is. Property destruction and harming human beings are profoundly different actions, and with a few exceptions (seemingly interlopers in the protests) virtually all the violence visited on human beings during this round of civil unrest across the US has been inflicted by police.&nbsp;</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/george-floyd-who-was-he-his-friends-words">An athlete, a father, a 'beautiful spirit': George Floyd in his friends' words</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-riots-violence-damage-property-police-brutality">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The UK has been too conservative about using our public spaces. We can learn from our European neighbours</p><p>Our local playing fields have come to life again. After weeks and weeks of mechanically circuiting this patch of green as part of our government-approved daily exercise, I was struck by a feeling of intense gratitude at simply being able to sit down on a blanket with a tinny, and it was clear others agreed. Families armed with picnic chairs and packed-up food set up camp as children circled the sausage rolls like sharks; a man jokingly offered his friend a crisp from his Pringles packet from two metres away, and was declined. Football was played, tunes were blasted and prosecco was guzzled. At least until everyone needed the loo and had to go home.</p><p>Under lockdown much of life has, ironically, moved outside. Even at its most severe, lockdown transformed my London neighbourhood, where £2m terraced houses are a stone’s throw from some of the most deprived estates in the country and outdoor space is at a premium. I know these streets by heart, but for the first time I passed by people sitting out on their steps, or maybe better to call them “stoops”, as the scene had something of a New York feel to it. There were others hanging out of windows, draping themselves over tiny patches of roof and sitting on the tops of porches. Kids played out in the street as though it were the 90s, a family had a barbecue in a parking space. Our next-door neighbours, who have a young child and a very small patch of concrete to call their garden, have been cooking and eating outside every day.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/lockdown-joys-outside-outside-covid-19-legacy">Continue reading...</a>

When I emailed the BBC with the standard offer to work around the interviewee’s schedule, I received the following slightly despondent reply: “Charlie says he has no schedule any more.” It sounded a little like this would be less an interview and more a courtesy call to make sure he was still taking care of himself.</p><p>I need not have worried because, as it turns out, Higson’s “no schedule” is the busy kind of “no schedule”.

Bulgarian artist who found fame with his great art project of wrapping the Reichstag in Berlin<p>On 25 February 1994, the Bundestag sat in extraordinary session in Bonn. Arguments were heated. The chancellor, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/16/helmut-kohl-obituary" title="">Helmut Kohl</a>, chose not to speak; he did, however, toy with the red card used in Germany’s parliament for the casting of no votes. After 70 minutes’ bad-tempered debate, Kohl’s party was defeated, 292 to 223. The project under discussion would go ahead, more than two decades after its inception.</p><p>As Christo Javacheff, who has died aged 84, liked to point out, it was almost certainly the first time an artwork had gone to parliamentary division. Christo, as he was usually known, had conceived the idea of wrapping the Reichstag more than 20 years previously. The building’s appeal to him lay in its history. It was, as Christo remarked, the only structure in a still-divided Berlin “that was under the jurisdiction of the Americans, the Soviets, the English, the French and the two Germanys”. Like the artist himself, it sat on a no-man’s land between warring political systems. “To me, as a Bulgarian refugee who fled communism, east-west relations are very important,” he said.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/01/christo-obituary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>I was a rookie standup when I came across Laurence Sterne’s classic, and it changed my view of not just comedy, but life</p><p>Circa spring 2008, I was struggling my way through an English literature degree. I’d always been an avid reader, though not, it was now apparent, a very fast one. Gone were the days where I could take three months over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/19/legacy-george-orwell-nineteen-eighty-four">Nineteen Eighty-Four</a> or Pig Heart Boy, bagging a few pages in the gaps between Championship Manager binges. To read at least two big books a week was the thing now, and write essays about them too. By this point, I was close to giving up, instead devoting most of my time to standup comedy, the perfect displacement for an ill-disciplined, attention-seeking undergraduate.</p><p>Each title on the reading list text brought with it more angst, none more so than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/28/100-best-novels-tristram-shandy-sterne">The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman</a><em> </em>by Laurence Sterne: another stupid, old-fashioned book with a stupid, old-fashioned name and a stupid, old-fashioned cover illustration of stupid, old-fashioned men.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/01/tristram-shandy-standup-laurence-sterne-comedy-liam-williams">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The sitcom may be responsible for the term, but in our final ever Jump the Shark we reveal that Fonzie’s waterskiing feat wasn’t even the show’s weirdest moment</p><p>And so, Jump the Shark – the column in which we pinpoint the precise moment TV shows of yesteryear went pants – has itself jumped the shark, to be replaced next week by, erm, who knows? Maybe a crossword, or a column called The Eureka Moment where Guardian writers pinpoint the exact moment crap TV shows get good? So let’s look at where the entire concept began, with the infamous moment in the fifth series of Happy Days where the Fonz (Henry Winkler) accepts a challenge to literally jump over a tiger shark on waterskis, in what looks like a pair of denim hot pants and his trademark leather jacket (obvs), in a stunt that was apparently created to showcase Winkler’s real-life waterskiing skills to the masses (Hi, girls).</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/info/2020/mar/25/the-guide-staying-in-sign-up-for-our-home-entertainment-tips">The Guide: Staying In – sign up for our home entertainment tips</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/01/happy-days-mork-from-ork">Continue reading...</a>

## Rachel Roddy's recipe for anchovy and roast tomato salad |A kitchen in Rome

<p>Buy the best anchovies and tomatoes you can lay your hands on for this intensely flavoured salad</p><p>There are 32 ways to say “anchovy” in Italian. Thirty-two regional names, many of them in dialect, for the small, slender fish with silvery sides and receding lower jaw. The most common names, though, for the much-loved chinless wonder are two: <em>alici</em> and <em>acciughe</em>.</p><p>While anchovies are abundant in the Mediterranean, Indian and Pacific oceans, they remain rare for many because they are so fragile, deteriorating with every hour they are out of the sea; even more so when they are transported. I see this five days a week at my local market when it receives the previous night’s catch from the fishing port of Anzio. The journey from Anzio into Rome is only 51km – not a problem for most of the fish, iced and insulated in shock-proof polystyrene boxes. The anchovies, however, seem to suffer every bump on the road. That isn’t to say they are not bright-eyed and beautiful; they are – especially at 8am, and even at 9 or 10am. But by midday, the change is visible: a tangible weariness comes over them, even more so on hot days. And then, when you get them home, you need to work fast, gutting and opening them like butterflies, then baking, braising, or – best of all – dipping them in flour and frying until they curl.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/01/rachel-roddy-anchovy-and-roast-tomato-salad-recipe">Continue reading...</a>

But his barrage against mail-in voting is particularly alarming ahead of an election during the Covid-19 pandemic, where there is likely to be severely limited in-person voting and many Americans will probably vote by mail for the first time. Advocates worry voters who don’t want to risk their health and vote in person could also be swayed by Trump’s rhetoric, not feel comfortable voting by mail, and simply choose not to vote at all.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-mail-in-voting-election-2020-election-attacks">Continue reading...</a>

Not only did it generate hits – Never Gonna Give You Up, Venus, Respectable and dozens of others – but the very sound of their records was industrialised. Instruments like the Linn 9000 drum machine and the Roland Juno-106 synthesiser were manufactured in one factory before being installed in SAW’s, the ersatz brass and strings becoming a new set of raw materials.</p><p>Pete Waterman had something of the cigar-chewing industrialist about him, too. “We make records to entertain people for between three to seven minutes, and if they don’t like them they don’t buy them,” he said in 1987. “If they do buy them, they are doing so not because of art but because they like the records.” He would go on fact-finding business trips, visiting France, Germany or Italy to spend hours sitting in his hotel room with pop radio on for inspiration (leading to some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uAys21t4us">notable</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-DZQ80vEVI">similarities</a>).

<p>In this weekly series, readers tell us about their favourite trees. This week: a beech in Lincolnshire </p><p>When Liz Dixon-Spain got married in 1967, there was only one place where she wanted to celebrate – in her parent’s garden with this beautiful beech tree (<em>Fagus sylvatica</em>) overlooking the festivities. She planted daffodils around it just for the occasion. “It felt wonderful having the tree in the background,” says the 73-year-old from South Holland, Lincolnshire. “I have been friends with it all my life.”</p><p>Holding wedding receptions in the garden has become something of a family tradition, with her two sisters also celebrating their nuptials next to the tree in 1974 and then 1977. The beech has been a constant presence in her family’s lives. “It is part of all of our family memories because they all happened around the tree,” Liz says.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/01/tree-of-the-week-i-have-been-friends-with-it-all-my-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether presenting on Channel 5, Radio 2 or Eggheads, the broadcaster is part of the national furniture. He reflects on impartiality, the public’s reaction to lockdown and salary inequality<br /></p><p>What is Jeremy Vine on? That is surely what everyone wants to know. If you could bottle the elixir that appears to give him limitless energy, it would not only be Donald Trump rushing to take it. We talk just after he has finished the second of the two-hour programmes he does every day – the mid-morning show on Channel 5 and the lunchtime show on BBC Radio 2. Vine, 55, has been up and working since 5am, yet he is still fresh and boundlessly enthusiastic.<br /><br />Why on earth does he do <em>two</em> news-based programmes so close together and, at the moment at least, covering such similar ground? “Channel 5 is like playing squash and Radio 2 is like playing snooker,” he says. “With a TV show, you have to have a big bang of you leaping out of the screen, whereas the joy of radio is the intimacy. It’s a <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2018-10-08/in-london-a-bike-is-quicker-than-a-maserati-how-jeremy-vine-dashes-between-his-new-tv-gig-and-his-radio-2-show/">busy old morning</a> and people say it must be stressful, but for a broadcaster the stressful thing is <em>not</em> broadcasting. As long as the red light’s on, we’re happy.”<br /><br />Vine says it has been extraordinary to be broadcasting during this crisis. “It’s given us a real sense of mission and purpose. I’ve never seen anything like it: 9/11 wasn’t like this; the crash of 2008 wasn’t like this. Every single story for weeks and weeks has been coronavirus, and when we’ve tried to break out of it – Harry and Meghan or something like that – it’s never felt quite right, because for most people this is bread and butter, this is every aspect of life. It’s amazing being at the crossroads of that conversation.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/01/jeremy-vine-at-the-bbc-you-can-have-values-but-you-cant-have-views-thats-how-i-operate">Continue reading...</a>
