The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

Abby O'Neill | June 19, 2020 -- At the top of March when the COVID-19 pandemic became imminent, Griselda — the triple threat emcee collective from Buffalo, N.Y., consisting of Westside Gunn, Conway, and Benny the Butcher — were about a week away from joining us at NPR's office for the trio's scheduled Tiny Desk. That performance, of course, did not take place. Since then, NPR Music has been inviting artists to record Tiny Desk (home) concerts, and Benny the Butcher blessed us with a five-song set from the living room of his current home in Atlanta. (Due to some recording snafus, some of the audio and video in this video doesn't always sync up.)

The setlist includes "Crown for Kings" and "5 to 50" from his critically acclaimed 2019 album, The Plugs I Met. Benny is joined by Rick Hyde and Heem, two artists on his new BSF label imprint, for a live performance of "Da Mob," the first single off an upcoming label compilation titled Benny The Butcher & DJ Drama Presents: Gangsta Grillz X BSF Da Respected Sopranos.

SET LIST
"Crown for Kings"
"Rubber Bands & Weight"
"Da Mob (feat. Rick Hyde and Heem)"
"Cruiser Weight Coke"
"5 to 50"

Bobby Carter | June 18, 2020 
I was very conflicted as I watched Little Dragon's Tiny Desk (home) concert. The group's latest album, New Me, Same Us, is their grooviest, most concentrated in years, and I was eager to hear these songs as Little Dragon's music is best experienced: live on stage. "Some of you might know that we were supposed to be on tour in the states, but due to these crazy times it got canceled," lead singer Yukimi Nagano says. On that same token, these stripped-down iterations from the band's home studio in Sweden move me but in a different way. I find myself focusing on the songwriting and how all the instruments come together for these numbers, proving just how strong the tracks from New Me... are. Then as a bonus, Little Dragon played an oldie, "Forever," which is still my favorite track from this genre-bending band. While I'm left to wish for the united movement with hundreds of others to the downbeat of songs like "Rush," this Tiny Desk performance solidifies me as a die-hard fan. I'll be first in line when the show resumes.

SET LIST
"Rush"
"Where You Belong"
"Forever"
"Every Rain"
