When Linda Scott started asking this question in Ghana more than a decade ago, the received wisdom she got was that girls are just too materialistic; they want clothes and phones, so they start trading sex for them, and then end up falling out of education because they are pregnant. The problem, she was told, lay with girls themselves.</p><p>It won\u2019t surprise many people to learn that this turned out to be the wrong answer. Scott, an Oxford scholar and expert in women\u2019s economic empowerment, was in Ghana testing the theory that girls drop out of school when their periods start due to a lack of sanitary pads. But she quickly discovered that it wasn\u2019t just the embarrassment of being seen to bleed through their clothes that deterred them from staying in class. A girl reaching the age of menstruation is deemed old enough to be sexually available; once men find out, she can expect to be followed home from school, sexually harassed, perhaps even raped. Giving girls sanitary pads which allowed them to keep their periods secret would not protect them for ever from predatory males, she concluded, but it could buy them a little more time in education. Sure enough, the girls who enrolled in a pilot project handing out free pads and information on puberty did spend more days in school. But that solution wouldn\u2019t have been possible without turning the question on its head, asking not what\u2019s wrong with girls, but what might be wrong with the conditions under which they are forced to live.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/18/the-double-x-economy-by-linda-scott-review-the-need-to-empower-women\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/18/the-double-x-economy-by-linda-scott-review-the-need-to-empower-women", "date_published": "2020-06-18 06:30:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "'Worst outbreak ever': Nearly a million pigs culled in Nigeria due to swine fever", "description": "<p>Farmers report devastating losses as poor control measures are blamed for spread of infection across the country</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of pigs have been culled by Nigerian farmers in response to an explosion of African swine fever (ASF).

Her trajectory of fear is not angled as you might think, towards a supernatural revelation or a down-to-earth explanatory twist or even an enigmatically balanced ambiguity between the two.

She is driven, focused, goal-oriented and excited by an imminent business trip to Rostock in Germany, where her consultancy firm is about to land a big commission. Lola is also looking forward to hotel-room assignations with her boss, Elise (Mavie H\u00f6rbiger), with whom she is having a passionate affair, made more dangerous by the fact that Elise is in a position to advance her career, or \u2013 perhaps \u2013 to impede it by capriciously advancing others on her team.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/18/the-ground-beneath-my-feet-review-marie-kreutzer-valerie-pachner\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/18/the-ground-beneath-my-feet-review-marie-kreutzer-valerie-pachner", "date_published": "2020-06-18 06:00:42+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "After I told Cummings about life as a single mother, we got support bubbles | Ella Davis", "description": "<p>Enraged by the Durham saga, I wrote to Boris Johnson\u2019s adviser.
