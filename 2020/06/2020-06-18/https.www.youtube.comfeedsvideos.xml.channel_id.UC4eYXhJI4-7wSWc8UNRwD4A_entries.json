Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAbby O'Neill | June 19, 2020 -- At the top of March when the COVID-19 pandemic became imminent, Griselda \u2014 the triple threat emcee collective from Buffalo, N.Y., consisting of Westside Gunn, Conway, and Benny the Butcher \u2014 were about a week away from joining us at NPR's office for the trio's scheduled Tiny Desk. That performance, of course, did not take place. Since then, NPR Music has been inviting artists to record Tiny Desk (home) concerts, and Benny the Butcher blessed us with a five-song set from the living room of his current home in Atlanta. (Due to some recording snafus, some of the audio and video in this video doesn't always sync up.)\n\nThe setlist includes \"Crown for Kings\" and \"5 to 50\" from his critically acclaimed 2019 album, The Plugs I Met. Benny is joined by Rick Hyde and Heem, two artists on his new BSF label imprint, for a live performance of \"Da Mob,\" the first single off an upcoming label compilation titled Benny The Butcher & DJ Drama Presents: Gangsta Grillz X BSF Da Respected Sopranos.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Crown for Kings\"\n\"Rubber Bands & Weight\"\n\"Da Mob (feat.

The group's latest album, New Me, Same Us, is their grooviest, most concentrated in years, and I was eager to hear these songs as Little Dragon's music is best experienced: live on stage. \"Some of you might know that we were supposed to be on tour in the states, but due to these crazy times it got canceled,\" lead singer Yukimi Nagano says. On that same token, these stripped-down iterations from the band's home studio in Sweden move me but in a different way. I find myself focusing on the songwriting and how all the instruments come together for these numbers, proving just how strong the tracks from New Me... are. Then as a bonus, Little Dragon played an oldie, \"Forever,\" which is still my favorite track from this genre-bending band. While I'm left to wish for the united movement with hundreds of others to the downbeat of songs like \"Rush,\" this Tiny Desk performance solidifies me as a die-hard fan. I'll be first in line when the show resumes.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Rush\"\n\"Where You Belong\"\n\"Forever\"\n\"Every Rain\"", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=koveFxBb3FU", "date_published": "2020-06-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Tiny Desk Contest Top Shelf, Episode 2", "description": "On Thursday, June 18, Brittany Howard and Tiny Desk series creator Bob Boilen were live for the second episode of Tiny Desk Contest Top Shelf, a weekly livestream series featuring the best entries from the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest, supported by @statefarm.\n\nArtists featured in this episode include:\n- The Bengsons (@thebengsons), \u201cPulls Out\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRfwWXCLDEs\n- Yasmin Williams (@guitar.yaz), \u201cThrough The Woods\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KV_4XXpxO8w\n- Nan\u00e9 (@NaneTheBand), \u201cBlue Velvet\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uG1onm9JXU0\n- Mermaid (@mermaid.band), \u201cFind Me\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUzFJPCfzbc\n- Peter \u201cMadcat\u201d Ruth, \u201cMadcat\u2019s Extravaganza\u201d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-VuXH8sdjo\n\nYou can learn more about the Tiny Desk Contest at npr.org/tinydeskcontest.\n\n#tinydesk #tinydeskcontest #tinydeskcontesttopshelf", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzOEJgwIM40", "date_published": "2020-06-18 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
