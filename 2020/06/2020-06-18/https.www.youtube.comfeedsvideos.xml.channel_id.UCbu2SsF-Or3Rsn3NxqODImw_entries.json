In an interview with GameSpot, EA Motive's Ian Frazier talks about the series' roots, how the studio balanced New Republic and Imperial craft, and how team composition can make or break your victory.\n\nThe comparisons to the classic Lucasarts series are readily apparent, especially as you're locked to cockpit view and can shift your ship's priorities between weapons, engines, and shields. But that's not the only way Motive drew inspiration. Frazier opened up about how the studio looked back at the strategies from those older games to help the nimble but fragile TIE Fighter feel like a match for the hearty and more full-featured X-Wing.\n\nWhichever side of the conflict you fall on, team composition will make a huge difference. Frazier also detailed how load-outs will be important not just for your own starfighter, but also for coordinating with your teammates. And to avoid what he calls the \"death loop\" of two pilots simply chasing each other down, Motive has put in a few advanced maneuverability strategies for ace pilots to outgun the competition.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Mc4G0AL_6I", "date_published": "2020-06-19 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Pokemon Isle Of Armor DLC First Impressions And Favorite PS5 Reveals - GameSpot After Dark #46", "description": "This week on GameSpot After Dark, Kallie talks about the Pokemon Isle of Armor DLC, Jake is playing Persona 4 Golden on PC, Jean-Luc tried the Ultrakill and System Shock demos, and Lucy revisits Horizon Zero Dawn.

Called Splashdown, the new season is water-themed and gives Fortnite an aquatic makeover.\n\nIn the video above, Jordan Ram\u00e9e details the six major changes that are a part of Fortnite Chapter 2, Season 3. The most noticeable change is the new map--Fortnite's battlefield has been completely flooded. To navigate between the landmarks, you'll primarily need to take to the air or the sea in order to get around, and it's via the latter method where you'll encounter Season 3's other major change: loot sharks. Yup, murderous loot sharks.\n\nLike every new season, Splashdown adds a new battle pass to work through, challenges to complete, and cosmetics to unlock. Splashdown adds two new weapons too--one of which, the hunting rifle, is a beloved older weapon that's been freed from its time in the vault. All this and more are detailed in the video above.\n\nGameSpot has officially kicked off Play For All--a celebration of all things gaming.

Cybperpunk 2077 is now set to released on November 19th, 2020. With the additional two months, CD Projekt Red will use the time to properly go through everything, balance game mechanics, and fix a lot of bugs. \n\nPersia also goes over new details behind Spider-Man: Miles Morales that give us a better idea of how long the game will be. Insomniac said the game will be comparable to Uncharted: The Lost legacy. This means that Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be shorter than the main story but longer than other spin-offs like Infamous: First Light. Even though the main story with Peter Parker isn't over yet, this game will be all about Miles and his journey in learning to be his own Spider-Man. \n\nSony has just trademarked it's new slogan for the PS5 DualSense controller. \"Heighten Your Senses\" likely refers to the haptic feedback feature which will provide another level of immersion through vibrations and varying tension mechanics. This feature will make things like drawing a bow feel more realistic than ever. \n\nEA Play is this afternoon and we'll be streaming all of the action here on GameSpot during #PlayForAll!

We chatted with Final Strike Games CEO Kevin Franklin on what separates the game from other hero shooters.\n\nAs part of Play For All, we chatted with Final Strike Games CEO Kevin Franklin about Rocket Arena, an upcoming hero shooter. As the name suggests, all weapons in Rocket Arena are rocket-based, creating a rather explosive-style of FPS.\n \nIn the video above, GameSpot host Kurt Indovina and Franklin talk about the process of how Final Strike Games designed Rocket Arena to appeal to a younger audience. Franklin previously worked on shooters like Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Doom--mechanically solid games, but not exactly approachable to kids in terms of content and the gameplay loop in the multiplayer.\n \nThat's where Rocket Arena's respawn mechanic comes in. As opposed to dying like in most shooters, you're knocked out of the arena in Rocket Arena. When you're sent flying out, you soar to the top of the arena and get a bird's eye view of the battle below--giving you a chance to forge a strategy and see where all the players are (both enemies and allies) before falling to earth.\n \nRocket Arena is scheduled to release for Xbox One, PS4, and PC.

To make it through, you're going to need a lot of skills, both for staying hidden to avoid danger and for killing things and people before they have a chance to kill you.\n\nCheck out the video above, where we've put together seven essential tips that will help you get used to the post-apocalypse, make the most of your game, and help Ellie survive to exact her revenge.\n\nIf you're a fan of The Last of Us, you might think you have a pretty good handle on how to stay alive as you patrol the area around Jackson or venture into the Seattle QZ. But protagonist Ellie has a bunch of new abilities for you to master this time out, which can have a big impact on the way you play. There are new enemies and challenges to face, as well, and they're out for your blood.\n\nWhat's more, Naughty Dog has included a bunch of new features for accessibility, allowing you to tune much of The Last of Us Part 2 to be exactly the experience you want, and to offer your ideal challenge.
