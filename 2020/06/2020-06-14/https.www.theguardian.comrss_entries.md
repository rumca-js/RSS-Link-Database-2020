<p>While it also focuses on an unbelievable, deadly emergency, this dramatisation of the poisoning of the Skripal family is a far cry from the chaos of life during the Covid crisis<br /></p><p><br />Those involved with the making of <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p08dqns1">The Salisbury Poisonings</a> cannot have known that, as well as rendering a true story, they were making an allegory.

However, as this three-part series unfolds, our mass experience under the Covid cloud seems distilled into this tale of the havoc wreaked by one tiny toxin.</p><p>Father and daughter are found slipping into unconsciousness on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. It looks like an overdose but, in the words of the policewoman first on the scene: “It just feels a bit off.” As the ambulance arrives and the Skripals’ vomit is powerhosed off the bench, she calls in CID. Det Sgt Nick Bailey (Rafe Spall) attends. He agrees with the officer that they are unlikely candidates for drug addiction, but it is only when a colleague Googles the name they find in the father’s wallet and discover he was part of a spy swap deal between Russia and the UK eight years before that they realise the scope of the possible explanations.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/14/the-salisbury-poisonings-review-novichok-drama-with-lessons-for-now">Continue reading...</a>

We were in constant correspondence with the Department for Education, including Ofsted, and even met with their heads. In 2005 we organised a conference on “Putting the ‘black’ back into British history: teaching inclusive history in schools”.

## The Guardian view on coronavirus harms: pandemic shows inequities are deadly | Editorial

<p>Poorer people and ethnic minorities are dying from Covid-19 at a far higher rate than richer, whiter groups. Ministers don’t want to address these inequalities because a decade of Tory government has exacerbated, not reduced, them</p><p>Last month Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-its-humanity-against-the-virus" title="">claimed</a> “it’s humanity against the virus – we are in this together”. The path of the pandemic shows we are not. In deprived areas of England and Wales people are dying from Covid-19 at more than <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/12/poorest-areas-of-england-and-wales-hit-hardest-by-covid-19-ons" title="">twice the rate</a> than in affluent areas. The disease <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people" title="">disproportionately</a> infects and kills black and minority ethnic people, revealing a racial pandemic within the viral pandemic. The reason for this is that Britain is an extremely unequal place. There’s a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/feb/24/austerity-blamed-for-life-expectancy-stalling-for-first-time-in-century" title="">social gradient</a> in health which means that even in normal times the poor die earlier than the rich. There is also a “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2018/01/14/577664626/making-the-case-that-discrimination-is-bad-for-your-health" title="">weathering</a>” effect where poor health results from a lifetime of discrimination. The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted and amplified such inequalities with deadly results.</p><p>Ministers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JADFvxQ7uME" title="">prefer</a> to talk about the vulnerability to coronavirus in terms of biology rather than society. That is understandable given that a decade of Tory government has not reduced health inequalities but exacerbated them. If people live in poorer areas they will have councils struggling with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/coronavirus-emergency-cash-poor-england-hotspots-conservatives-a9528371.html" title="">fewer resources</a> and find themselves with <a href="https://bjgp.org/content/68/677/562" title="">shorter, less empathetic GP consultations</a>. They won’t be as shielded from the virus as those who live in well-heeled parts of the country. If people have low-paying work that can’t be done remotely, have to take public transport to get to frontline jobs, or live in crowded houses, they do not have the same fighting chance as those higher up the social scale. The disease knows where to find the weakest links.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/14/the-guardian-view-on-coronavirus-harms-pandemic-shows-inequities-are-deadly">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Britain’s best in the open water shares her experiences of racism in swimming and how she is breaking barriers for black people to take up the sport<br /></p><p>It sounds scarcely believable in modern, multiracial Britain but nearly a century after the sprinter Jack London became the first black athlete to win an Olympic medal for Britain in 1928, and more than 40 years since Viv Anderson became the first black footballer to start for England, Team GB has never sent a black swimmer to an Olympic Games. Not one.</p><p>But next summer Alice Dearing, a 23-year-old from Birmingham who is Britain’s best open-water swimmer, intends to flip 125 years of history on its head in Tokyo – the small matter of a global pandemic permitting. And, as becomes clear over a thought-provoking and nuanced conversation, that is only the start of her ambitions.<br /><br />“Being a poster girl for black swimming is exciting, because genuinely I love the sport and I want to see as many people doing it as possible,” Dearing says. “But it’s also terrifying because there’s a lot of pressure. I have rationalised it – if not me, then who? And I want this to happen as soon as possible, to break that barrier.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/14/alice-dearing-i-dont-want-to-always-be-referred-to-as-the-black-swimmer-from-britain">Continue reading...</a>

## When polite petitions and humble pleas are ignored, protest is essential | Nesrine Malik

<p>Many of our most treasured rights were won by people who knew when to stop following the rules and take to the streets</p><p>“Don’t boo. Vote.” This was <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/28/dont-boo-vote-barack-obamas-2016-democratic-convention-speech-in-full">the message</a> Barack Obama had, during the 2016 presidential election, for a crowd of Democrats who jeered when he mentioned the Republican party.<strong> </strong>It became his mantra as he campaigned for Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />It is a familiar reproach. If you’re angry, don’t boo, don’t protest, don’t take matters into your own hands. Vote, lobby, report to the authorities, trust the process. It’s the appeal of reasonable liberals and the rebuke of rightwingers. It is the refrain that rings out when demands for justice “go too far”.<br /><br />As protests after the death of George Floyd got bigger and bigger in the United States – and then began to spread around the world – the focus of conversations in the media shifted abruptly. Now the issue was vandalism and anarchy, precisely what Donald Trump and his backers wanted to talk about as they cynically accused black protesters of dishonouring Floyd’s memory. And in the UK, it’s easier to talk about the lawless mobs tearing down statues than the crimes these <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/the-day-bristol-dumped-its-hated-slave-trader-in-the-docks-and-a-nation-began-to-search-its-soul">mo</a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/14/the-day-bristol-dumped-its-hated-slave-trader-in-the-docks-and-a-nation-began-to-search-its-soul">numents commemorate</a>.<br /><br />But this is nothing new. What we rarely hear about all the great revolutions of the past is that they too looked at first like spontaneous uprisings against the existing order – and they too were subject to charges of anarchy, reckless violence, puritanical revenge. So much so that the economist Albert Hirschman described the demand to “follow the process” as “the first reaction” whenever the threat of real change is on the horizon.<br /><br />The first accounts of the French revolution made no distinction between its positive and negative aspects – collapsing its moral position and its violent manifestations into one. The result was that, for a long time, it was defined and smeared by its excesses. It was only the passage of time that transformed it into “<a href="https://www.doubledown.news/watch/2020/5/june/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-the-question-of-violence-gary-young">a riot blessed by history</a>”, as Gary Younge puts it. Closer to our own time, the poll tax riots in 1990, now part of a national odyssey of popular rebellion against an overreaching Thatcher government, were originally blamed on anarchists and the far left, with an official account that vastly underestimated the number of peaceful protesters and the degree of police provocation.<br /><br />Today, it is the Black Lives Matter movement that is being discredited for not staying in its lane; for refusing to “<a href="https://twitter.com/daaronovitch/status/1271375833496801281?s=21">quit while they’re still ahead</a>”, in the words of one broadsheet columnist. But protests happen in the first place because the “proper channels” have failed – in some cases, because previous protests have also failed. When #MeToo first began, it only took a moment for women to be told to report their assaults to the authorities instead of taking their allegations public, lest they destroy a man’s reputation before he could have a hearing. But it didn’t occur to these critics that the court of public opinion was itself a last resort. When a statue falls, you don’t see the years of campaigning and lobbying and writing that went before it, and came to nothing. When Extinction Rebellion occupies central London, you don’t see the power – corporate lobbyists, complacent politicians, indifferent bureaucrats – that marginalised these concerns for so long that activists knew there was no other way.<br /><br />The very nature of being excluded from the spaces in which decisions are made means that the process of managing grievances is already rigged against you. The very position of black people as always appellants, never adjudicators, means that every protest will soon enough be denigrated as violent or disruptive. Their demands will always be dismissed as unreasonable, their priorities confused, their methods offputting to erstwhile allies. Politely they will be questioned: are statues really <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/jun/14/statue-wars-must-not-distract-reckoning-with-racism-david-olusoga">the most important thing</a> here? May I call your attention to your pay gap? Your incarceration rates? They will be lectured about coalition-building, about easy wins that mean little in the end, and the hard graft that needs to be done if they’re going to get anywhere. Because we have processes, you see.<br /><br />And these rules must be respected – because conservatives will always hold them up to stymie any change, and because liberals are afraid to admit that most of our rules and norms are neither definitive nor universally observed. They are afraid to shatter the illusion and face the reality that so many of these rules are, in fact, broken all the time by people who can get away with it: tax avoiders, labour exploiters, vote manipulators. And so it is those who cannot get away with breaking the rules who are told they must uphold what is left of this order; it is their responsibility to ensure that the slope does not get too slippery and allow us all to slide into chaos.<br /><br />But as long as concessions have to be prised from the hands of the establishment, rather than reasonably handed over, we cannot live without slippery slopes. Our history may, in time, bless some riots; but it also sands the rough edges off many others, expunging the anger of martyrs and revolutionaries and telling us that their victories, over slavery or Jim Crow, were the benign gift of those masters whose morality carried the day.<br /><br />Today’s movements for equality are expected to resemble the dramatised depictions of their sainted predecessors – conveniently forgetting the calumnies heaped upon Nelson Mandela, Martin Luther King and Gandhi, from enemies and would-be “allies” alike. Random quotes from black icons are cherry-picked out of context from the past and waved in front of the protesters of the present, in an attempt to shame them into the most timid form of political activism possible.<br /><br />The Black Lives Matter <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/13/st-albans-has-never-seen-anything-like-this-britain-rallies-for-black-lives-matter">protests in the UK</a> have been accused of being vague and rudderless, merely a faint echo of their American counterparts, whose complaints and demands are deemed more legitimate, more concrete: to bring police to justice for their killings of black people, and to strip away the impunity, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean">outsized funding</a> and overweening power of local police forces. But even that demand, specific and studied as it is, has been dismissed as unrealistic. There will always be some component missing from the playbook of the perfect protest. Even without leaders and discrete demands, the protests in the UK are a legitimate expression of racial grievances for which there has been no redress and no justice. The streets are swelling for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/13/grenfell-tower-fire-anniversary-covid-19-response">Grenfell</a>, for Windrush, for the illegally deported and the unlawfully detained, and for all those who perished before their time in a pandemic that claims their lives at three times the rate of their white neighbours’. We may not know how this protest is going to end, but it has to start somewhere.<br /><br />The premise of change is that risks and chances need to be taken. And the movements that will be born from that demand will never be neat, and never have been. The effort to humanise black lives and win them the rights to safety and the dignity of equality may involve – among many other things – pulling down statues when it becomes clear that polite petitions and humble pleas to decolonise the curriculum will for ever go unheard. Process by its very nature is conservative. To insist that the aggrieved must “follow the rules” or lose our support is to ignore the lessons of history. Many of the rights we now take for granted were won by people who knew when the time had come to give up on the establishment. Civil disobedience, strikes, riots and boycotts are not the hijacking of process: they are its continuation by other means.</p><p>• Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/14/protest-essential-rights-rules-streets">Continue reading...</a>

Three hens scratch and snooze in the dirt, while another two peck at the grass, sporadically wandering up to the door to try to spot their owner. Originally destined for the slaughterhouse after laying intensively at commercial egg farms, Penny, Hattie, Daisy, Annie and Polly are enjoying an idyllic retirement.&nbsp;</p><p>Charlotte Pacey, 32, who designs play areas for children, says the hens look very different from when they arrived at her home in November 2018. “Penny, Hattie and another hen we called Fleur were so poorly when we collected them,” she recalls. “They were missing feathers, trembling with fear, had pale-looking combs and looked quite sick.” Fleur died after two days, but Penny and Hattie have fully recuperated.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/14/my-chickens-are-always-pleased-to-see-me-life-with-the-hen-rescuers">Continue reading...</a>

Yet his second LP as Rose City Band (he plays everything except drums, where John Jeffrey helps out) might be the best of the bunch. Owing much to 1970s country rock, RCB’s signature sound is essentially the same as Wooden Shjips’s, only with their defining fuzzed-up guitars stripped away to reveal warm, lazily blissed-out songs underpinned by relentless motorik rhythms.</p><p>There are echoes of the Byrds’ I Wasn’t Born to Follow (Only Lonely) and the restless momentum of Dylan circa <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/10/radio-bob-dylan-arthur-miller">Highway 61</a></em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/10/radio-bob-dylan-arthur-miller"> </a><em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/oct/10/radio-bob-dylan-arthur-miller">Revisited</a></em> (Real Long Gone). But for the most part these eight songs stand on their own merits, unfurling unhurriedly with Johnson’s understated vocals offset by gently spiralling guitar lines that are as hypnotic as they are breezy – never more so than on the closing sprawl of Wee Hours seguing seamlessly into Wildflowers. In an increasingly fraught world, it’s an unashamedly sunny sound. It makes for a gorgeous record in which to lose yourself for 40 minutes.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/14/rose-city-band-summerlong-review-a-gorgeous-record">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Everything is fluid in the Paris apartment of an artistic director and scenographer famed in the fashion world for his visual displays</p><p>I’m always searching for objects,” says Jean-Christophe Aumas of the midcentury designs and curiosities that lend his Pigalle apartment its theatrical, lived-in look. The Parisian artistic director and founder of the visual and set design studio, Singular, is the imaginative eye behind some of luxury fashion’s most spectacular creative displays. Aumas spends his days scouring flea markets and galleries for design finds and furnishings, destined for the windows, instore scenes and events he conjures for everyone from Hermès to Diptych. Starting his career at Christian Lacroix, Aumas joined Marc Jacobs at Louis Vuitton as head of visual identity in 1997, before striking out on his own to collaborate with a roster of clients including Phoebe Philo and Alber Elbaz.</p><p>“I learned something different from each one of them,” he says. “From Philo it was the beauty of simplicity; that even a plain chair can be wonderful and compelling.” From Jacobs, it was unfettered self-expression. “He let us do whatever we wanted to do,” says Aumas, who has distilled every one of these sartorial lessons into the home he shares with his French bulldog, René.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/14/setting-the-stage-inside-an-ever-changing-paris-apartment">Continue reading...</a>

## Wiley: The Godfather 3 review – grime's patriarch bids farewell (again)

<p>(CTA)</p><p>Wiley’s 2017 retirement album, <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jan/15/wiley-the-godfather-grime-back-with-banger">Godfather</a></em>, was so well received that he forgot to retire. He’s made two sequels and a pop album – now shelved – built around last year’s dancehall hit <a href="https://youtu.be/huaE85-V8u4">Boasty</a>. Thankfully, this second sequel has nothing of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jan/08/wiley-vs-stormzy-sparks-fly-in-grimes-generation-game">hilariously Shakespearean beef with Stormzy</a> six months and a lifetime ago, and very little sappy R&amp;B rap. Instead, Richard Cowie MBE plays the ageing grime patriarch and dispenses favour to those following his pioneering path. Which, according to him, is everyone.</p><p>Sometimes this feels a bit like being lectured in a pub car park on a Friday night. If only Wiley would one day tell us where he’s from, or perhaps touch on the vicissitudes of the music industry! Still, even as he paws at these pet topics over and again, you realise that he rarely dwells on the trappings of success. Like any Don Corleone he wants respect, not just fealty, and clearly cares deeply about grime’s future with or without him. As such, the best bits of this exhausting, endless album are Protect the Empire (“We built this up/ That’s why we must protect it”), letter-to-the-kids Light Work, and the ludicrously exciting Eskimo Dance, young talent (it features 13 MCs) colliding explosively with ancient riddims.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/14/wiley-godfather-3-review">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Unofficial trails quietly carved into the landscape by people seeking shortcuts are nothing new. But lockdown has lent them a surprising new twist…</p><p>Since the beginning of lockdown, a new path has sprung up in my local park – it snakes underneath a tree and up (and then down) a small hill, marking the way to the local Sainsbury’s. It is not an official path paved by keen construction workers in the dead of the night, but a “desire path” – a walkway made by hundreds of shuffling feet damaging the grass and eroding the ground beneath them. If “real” paths show us where we should go and how we should get there, then desire paths expose the complicated messiness of humanity. They are visible markers of our autonomy or, at the very least, our undeniable love of shortcuts.</p><p>Because the grass isn’t being cut, you start seeing them.

<p>As she prepares to release a second album, the Californian indie rocker reflects on provocative lyrics, recent collaborations and what she now thinks of Ryan Adams</p><p>You are a talented young musician whose career has taken off in the past couple of years. Artists you greatly admire want to collaborate with you, declaring themselves “floored” by your music, and excitable comparisons are made to the work of Bob Dylan and Leonard Cohen. Now you’re touring the world, jetting off to faraway places that you could only dream about while growing up in west-coast suburbia. But when you get there – to Japan, say – you find yourself strangely unmoved by your surroundings. Worse, you end up longing for the everyday comforts you’ve left behind. You would rather skip the visit to the temple or the ride on the bullet train with your bandmates and sneak home.</p><p>This is the predicament in which Phoebe Bridgers finds herself on her new album, <em>Punisher</em>, a collection of beautifully wrought songs that cast a razor-sharp eye on the absurdities of modern life. In Bridgers’s lyrical universe, dreams that appear beguiling from a distance are liable to fall flat in the space of a chorus. “I wanted to see the world,” she sings rousingly on Kyoto. “Then I flew over the ocean/ And I changed my mind.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/14/phoebe-bridgers-aged-12-or-13-i-was-just-like-im-the-next-bob-dylan">Continue reading...</a>

I wanted that softness, proper shirting and all the detail of buttons and buttonholes, but without any of the stiffness.” That feel was something she had first found in markets and jumble sales after she left art school in London in 1969. She initially used to refashion the old Jermyn Street shirts she rummaged for, and then, having sourced the precise weight of Egyptian cotton from David &amp; John Anderson in Glasgow, started to make her own.</p><p>The shirt Howell is holding is in the basement archive of <a href="https://www.margarethowell.co.uk/" title="">her shop</a> on Margaret Street in London. It is “filed” on a rack with some of her other original pieces, all made nearly 50 years ago, and lovingly retained, along with drawings and adverts and photos and press clippings that chart the beginnings of her eponymous brand. From those beginnings Howell has established not only her landmark Wigmore Street store up the road, but a global presence that includes outlets in Paris and Florence and New York, more than 100 shops in Japan and revenues in excess of £100m a year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/14/margaret-howell-50-years-design-katharine-hepburn">Continue reading...</a>

## Pulling the strings: meet the people who brought puppets to life

<p>Puppets were once ubiquitous on TV, but over the past two decades they’ve all but vanished. What happened to them – and to the humans who used to control them?</p><p>I was the producer of <em>The Broom Cupboard</em>, with Phillip Schofield, which wrapped around the children’s programmes on BBC1 for an hour-and-a-half each day. No one at the BBC paid us much attention, so we’d just try out loads of ideas. Phillip was once sent a puppet by a viewer. Originally his arms and legs were long enough to wrap around a person, but one of our bosses didn’t like that so we got them shortened – and that became Gordon. We thought he looked like a gopher, but we weren’t really sure. He wore out pretty quickly, so we got the BBC to make more. The new ones were too bright for the camera, so I’d dull the colour and matt the fur by using him to clean the floor.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/14/whatever-happened-to-gordon-the-gopher-and-all-the-other-tv-puppets">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a city of nearly 20 million people, Akinbode Akinbiyi captures a moment of calmness amid the frenzy</p><p>Akinbode Akinbiyi has lived and taken photographs in many cities. He was born in Oxford in 1946, went to university in Ibadan, Nigeria, is based in Berlin and has spent long periods in Khartoum, Bamako, Cairo and Dakar. He has suggested that the cities choose him: “They call out my name, and if I am fully awake, I hear the call and gradually wend my way toward them.”&nbsp;</p><p>He took this picture at Bar Beach on Victoria Island in Lagos in 2006. The woman in her white Sunday robes stands in curious relation to the three deck chairs. In other pictures in an ongoing series from the beach – Sea Never Dry – white tourists sit in similar chairs watching the procession of workers and schoolchildren pass by on the sand. Here the chairs are empty, and the woman expresses a quiet gesture of expectation or supplication, almost lost against the pale greys of sea and sky. The picture sets the tone of a retrospective of Akinbiyi’s work in Berlin entitled Six Songs, Swirling Gracefully in the Taut Air. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2018/mar/19/urban-explosion-kinshasa-el-alto-growth-mexico-city-bangalore-lagos">Lagos</a> is a city of nearly 20 million people, yet in among the frenzy of street scenes, Akinbiyi’s camera invariably locates little moments of stillness, like cool alleyways of time.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/14/the-big-picture-a-beach-of-her-own-lagos-2006">Continue reading...</a>

<p>It’s not going to be easy, so Jay enlists the help of Michel Roux Jr</p><p>A Sunday afternoon in lockdown and I am standing at the stove watching molten butter burn, because a nice lady in Manchester told me I must and, right now, I’m extremely suggestible. I’ve already had a traumatic interaction with some pastry that was so short it only held together out of good manners. Now here I am, burning butter. I need help. No, what I really need is a restaurant kitchen full of skilled cooks to do this for me, but that’s not exactly available right now.</p><p>Do I need tell you that I miss restaurants? I miss their noise and promise and menus and dishwashers. That got me thinking. I can’t bring the restaurant into my home, but perhaps I could bring the food. Wouldn’t that be great? Pick a few of my favourite dishes and scatter them through my week like suddenly-blooming nasturtium seeds. It would be my food fantasies made flesh, and many other food groups besides.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/14/with-time-on-his-hands-and-a-yen-for-souffle-our-restaurant-critic-turns-chef">Continue reading...</a>
