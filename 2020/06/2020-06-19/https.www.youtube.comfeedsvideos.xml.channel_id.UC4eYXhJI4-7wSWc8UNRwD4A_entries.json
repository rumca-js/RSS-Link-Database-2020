Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nAbby O'Neill | June 19, 2020 -- At the top of March when the COVID-19 pandemic became imminent, Griselda \u2014 the triple threat emcee collective from Buffalo, N.Y., consisting of Westside Gunn, Conway, and Benny the Butcher \u2014 were about a week away from joining us at NPR's office for the trio's scheduled Tiny Desk. That performance, of course, did not take place. Since then, NPR Music has been inviting artists to record Tiny Desk (home) concerts, and Benny the Butcher blessed us with a five-song set from the living room of his current home in Atlanta. (Due to some recording snafus, some of the audio and video in this video doesn't always sync up.)\n\nThe setlist includes \"Crown for Kings\" and \"5 to 50\" from his critically acclaimed 2019 album, The Plugs I Met. Benny is joined by Rick Hyde and Heem, two artists on his new BSF label imprint, for a live performance of \"Da Mob,\" the first single off an upcoming label compilation titled Benny The Butcher & DJ Drama Presents: Gangsta Grillz X BSF Da Respected Sopranos.\n\nSET LIST\n\"Crown for Kings\"\n\"Rubber Bands & Weight\"\n\"Da Mob (feat.
