<p>New Zealand’s new opposition leader has a stiff task against the wildly popular incumbent, but the conservative senses an opening thanks to the Covid crisis</p><p>The man who will challenge Jacinda Ardern in the hope of becoming New Zealand’s next prime minister introduced himself to the country in front of a loyal, local crowd in his old rugby clubrooms. There were scones with butter, rugby trophies proudly on display, and on the wall, someone from the club had put up a tino rangatiratanga – or Indigenous Māori sovereignty – flag (it turned out to be upside down, something the rugby club say they were responsible for). <br /><br />Todd Muller’s launch last Sunday was not flashy or digital; in one sense it was politics of the old school. But for those who listened to the long, nuanced speech, Muller cited both National party prime ministers – from his own, centre-right group – and those from Ardern’s centre-left Labour, as chief among his influences.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/can-new-zealands-national-party-reinvent-itself-under-todd-muller">Can New Zealand's National party reinvent itself under Todd Muller? | Jennifer Curtin</a> </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/20/rugby-scones-and-old-school-charm-todd-muller-plots-the-downfall-of-jacinda-ardern">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Paul Pogba came on at Spurs, United had their two biggest talents on the pitch together at last and this could prove decisive</p><p>It was, you suspect, a move that Paul Pogba had been practising barefoot in his Cheshire front room for the last three months: tweaking, fine‑tuning, waiting impatiently for the moment when he could unleash it on some poor unwitting mug of an opponent. And here, 10 minutes from the end of a taut and enthralling game, it was Eric Dier who found himself desperately lunging at thin air, giving away the penalty from which Bruno Fernandes earned Manchester United a deserved share of the points.</p><p>Pogba and Fernandes. Fernandes and Pogba. And Scott McTominay, of course, although you suspect he’ll struggle to share top billing. If not quite the most ambitious crossover event in history, then the entrance of Pogba as a substitute in the 63rd minute – joining the Portuguese international on the pitch in a competitive fixture for the first time – marked the point at which United fans got their first look at their new £136m midfield axis. The early auguries, it has to be said, were good.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/jun/19/fernandes-and-pogba-give-manchester-united-hope-of-top-four-finish">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Confusion over contracts, scheduling and the return to training have all added up to create one big mess and the Premiership is struggling to deal with it</p><p>If you were to highlight the biggest problem in English club rugby at the moment you would have plenty to choose from. From the arbitrary deadline given to players to sign new contracts with their clubs to the jostling by unions over who has priority in the autumn, it is fair to say that 15 August – the Premiership’s provisional restart date – feels a long way away.</p><p>In every instance, however, there has been the common problem of communication – or lack of it. Initially the narrative over wage cuts was that the players were rejecting them, that they were not willing to help or that they did not understand the gravity of the situation the clubs were in. Perhaps that was the case at the start, but the reason was that it was not properly explained to them. And it is certainly not the case now.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/19/english-club-rugby-is-spoilt-for-choice-when-it-comes-to-picking-problems">Continue reading...</a>

The date was 6 March 1988, and the game was the north London derby Arsenal v Tottenham at Highbury in the Barclays First Division.</p><p>George Graham’s Gunners won the match 2-1 with a well-taken effort by Perry Groves deciding the contest; one touch to control and a volley on the spin proving decisive. Clive Allen scored for Spurs.

## The Shadow of the Wind and the remarkable success of Carlos Ruiz Zafón

<p>Although modelled on the storytelling of Dickens and Tolstoy, his enormously popular novels were sharply attuned to our times<br /></p><p>Although all of Carlos Ruiz Zafón’s most successful books were published in the 21st century – The Shadow of the Wind, the first of the quartet on which his reputation rests, appeared in Spanish in 2001, and in English three years later – he was, at heart, a 19th-century novelist. His aim, in which he succeeded, was to emulate the narratively propulsive but socially reflective fiction of Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins and Leo Tolstoy.</p><p>Another pivotal influence was even more distant: back to the start of the 17th century and the book often regarded as the birth of the modern novel: Don Quixote, written by a compatriot, Miguel de Cervantes. It was often said in Spain that Ruiz Zafón was Cervantes’ only equal in literary impact, and the later writer’s fiction genuflected to that of his predecessor, especially in digressive style, tales within tales, and multiple subplots.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/19/the-shadow-of-the-wind-success-carlos-ruiz-zafon">Continue reading...</a>

<p>His life partly inspired Uncle Tom’s Cabin. He was entertained at both Windsor Castle and the White House. He rescued more than 100 enslaved people. But barely anyone has heard of him</p><p>From its very first moments, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s debut novel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/30/race.society">Uncle Tom’s Cabin</a> was a smashing success. It sold out its 5,000-copy print run in four days in 1852, with one newspaper declaring that “everybody has read it, is reading, or is about to read it”. Soon, 17 printing presses were running around the clock to keep up with demand. By the end of its first year in print, the book had sold more than 300,000 copies in the US alone, and another million in Great Britain.

## This is Boris Johnson's midlife crisis. The rest of us just have to live in it | Marina Hyde

<p>A £900k plane respray, a dirt bike and two new royal yachts. A Celtic knot tattoo on the prime ministerial arm cannot be far off </p><p>A strong sense of empires crumbling this week, as Led Zeppelin are no longer the biggest dickheads ever to demand a plane respray. Sliding into the top spot are Boris Johnson and his government, with the prime minister taking time out of accidentally bumping off British citizens to order a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/17/paint-job-on-boris-johnson-plane-will-cost-taxpayer-900000-pounds">£900,000 paint job on his VIP Voyager aircraft</a>.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that he didn’t reveal the plans at one of the daily No 10 press conferences. Here’s a slide showing how tens of thousands more people than necessary have Sadly Died because of decisions I took or put off taking. But looking at the positives, here’s a slide of the new designs for my plane! As for the respray, I’m picturing something that befits our status in the world. Perhaps giant letters reading “Air Farce One”. The budget option would be to keep it grey and just scrawl a classic across the side, like “CLEAN ME” or “My plane is dirtier than your mum”. If not, maybe Johnson would be drawn to something like “If this plane’s a-rockin’, don’t come a-knockin’”, or “Don’t laugh, lady – your daughter could be in here”.<br /><br />None of these would be any less absurd than the justification for it all by cabinet minister Oliver Dowden. I note that Oliver is a Conservative culture secretary, which has historically been like being the Ku Klux Klan’s equalities wizard. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/17/paint-job-on-boris-johnson-plane-will-cost-taxpayer-900000-pounds">Here he is</a> on Johnson’s paint job: “We really are a creative industries superpower, and we should be promoting that. I think the work on Voyager is part of that.” To which the most reasonable reply is: wut? Still, let’s try to clamber inside the logic simulator and work out what – in the name of his favourite album being a free CD that came on the front of the Sunday Times in 2007 – Oliver is trying to say here. Is it that theatres are in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/17/cultural-catastrophe-uk-theatre-faces-ruin-amid-coronavirus-crisis">such acute crisis</a> that 75% of them may never reopen, so we need to get this piece of military hardware into the bodyshop? Is it that we made Fleabag, and that’s why my boss needs a penis extension? I’m finding the philosophy somewhat impenetrable.<br /><br />Then again, Johnson has always seen some mystical correlation between his sense of sexual potency and the success of the nation. He has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/06/johnson-accuses-corbyn-of-siding-with-uks-enemies-in-fight-on-terror">previously fretted</a> that Trident going to sea without missiles would mean “the whole country is literally firing blanks”. He has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/06/voters-back-trustworthy-theresa-may-boris-johnson-leadership-campaign">described himself</a> as the man “to put some lead in the collective pencil”. And he’d now like us “to have a chlorinated chicken in every port”. Actually, I think I invented that last one – but you’re welcome for the image. We’re all men of the world, and no one said dockside life was for the faint-hearted.<br /><br />Speaking of grotesque maritime adventures, it feels the moment to turn to one minister’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-penny-mordaunt-royal-yachts-overseas-aid-money-a9572376.html">widely publicised letter</a> to Johnson this week in the wake of his <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/19/aid-groups-warn-boris-johnson-against-combining-dfid-with-foreign-office">shameful decision to merge</a> the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office. This requested that the government spend money intended for overseas aid on two new yachts to replace the Royal Yacht Britannia.<br /><br />The letter was written by Penny Mordaunt, hitherto one of the less lavishly useless ones. When Dominic Cummings broke lockdown to drive to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight and so on, Tory MPs were swamped by furious constituents. Mordaunt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/inconsistencies-dominic-cummings-story-senior-tory-penny-mordaunt-lockdown">went on record</a> to offer them her “deepest regrets” and say that there were “some inconsistencies in his account of events and the reasons behind it”. In the immediate wake of this, a “well-placed observer” <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/official-inquiry-into-dominic-cummings-would-be-waste-of-time-says-boris-johnson-kh2pbg8wj">told the Times</a>: “Dom is very vindictive. I think someone like Penny – she’s fucked. I know how they operate and she is in big trouble. They will go after her.”<br /><br />Alternatively, she might have to pass some mad loyalty test, like having to execute a snitch in an abandoned warehouse in front of her crime boss – or write a letter saying that aid money has to be spent on a yacht. Sorry, two yachts. That, I imagine, is when you lower the gun you were handed, shaking with a mixture of horror, fear, relief (maybe even a tiny trace of exhilaration), and Cummings claps you on the back and goes: “That it’s, Pen. Always knew you were one of us.”<br /><br />In terms of cultural exports, of course, we are now a country where the foreign secretary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/dominic-raab-taking-the-knee-feels-like-symbol-of-subjugation">informs the world</a> that Black Lives Matter protesters’ taking a knee “seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones” [sic]. Domestically, the DfId/FCO merger is a culture war gambit that reminds us this government will be coming for the BBC soon enough. In that act of cultural vandalism, they will be assisted by various quarterwits on the left who want to privatise a utility currently owned by the public, and who believe that a strong, independent leftwing media will spring up in its place. Just like it has in all the other countries.<br /><br />Still, no doubt the politicians can visit these on their royal yacht replacement. I’m afraid I don’t yet know the purpose of the second yacht Mordaunt has requested. Maybe some kind of human ark? There may come a point where Johnson’s administration has wiped out so many British citizens that the only way for us to survive as a world-beating master race is to take to the high seas – and they will get higher, if he has his way – where a retinue of women will be impregnated by one hugely self-regarding enthusiast. I can’t imagine who.<br /><br />In the meantime, surely it’s time to point out that if a telly chef was behaving like Johnson, you know what people would be saying. Let’s look at the evidence: the chap in question has left his wife for someone very much younger. He has recently acquired a dirt bike on which to bomb round the grounds of Chequers. He now wants not one but three ludicrously showy high-performance vehicles. Come on – does the prime minister have to get a Celtic knot tattoo before we can call what’s happening by its name? Does Johnson have to casually push up his sleeve at the dispatch box to reveal a newly inked piece of Route 66 body art, then say to Keir Starmer “I’m headed for the open road of life, mate”? Does he have to be spotted in a terrible leather jacket? Do a triathlon? Learn to surf? If it were anyone else in public life, then the Daily Mail’s Sarah Vine would have written 15 columns about it, so allow me to “go there” on her behalf: the prime minister is having an incredibly cliched midlife crisis, and we’re all having to live in it.<br /><br />If this was Bake Off’s Paul Hollywood, then fine. I myself would get a couple of columns out of it; and in any case he’s only in charge of a baking tent, a Kawasaki Ninja and a semi-custom Big Dog Ridgeback (I’m told it doesn’t ride as good as it looks). But when they’re in charge of an entire country, shambolic pandemic response and some nuclear codes, it does feel like something we should all keep an eye on. A powerless one, yes: but still an eye.</p><p>• Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/19/boris-johnson-midlife-crisis-plane-respray-royal-yachts">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The majority of people will drift back to their baseline mood of cheery or curmudgeonly, even after seismic events</p><p>Has there ever been an easier time to be a futurist? I’m distrustful of the profession at the best of times, since it involves making pronouncements about a time that hasn’t arrived – and not being held to account for your errors when it does arrive, because then it’s no longer the future, and thus no concern of the futurists. But these days, as the world staggers uncertainly out of lockdown, it’s even easier. All you need to say is that in life in general, or in whatever field you’re supposedly expert, everything’s<em> </em>going to change. <a href="https://www.chronicle.com/article/How-the-Coronavirus-Will/248750" title="">Education</a>, the <a href="https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-world-economy-globalization-2f62f6c2-8f4e-4ca9-9725-b77b537f27d4.html" title="">economy</a>, <a href="https://www.jpost.com/international/how-will-coronavirus-change-air-travel-forever-626693" title="">travel</a>, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90486053/all-the-things-covid-19-will-change-forever-according-to-30-top-experts" title="">work,</a> <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/25/why-the-coronavirus-might-change-dating-forever.html" title="">dating</a>, <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/the-coronavirus-pandemic-will-subside-but-sports-will-be-altered-forever-142507306.html" title="">sport</a>, the <a href="https://www.campaignlive.com/article/will-adland-permanently-change-aftermath-coronavirus/1680440" title="">advertising industry</a>, the world of <a href="https://www.cantechonline.com/blog/25112/10-ways-covid-19-has-changed-the-can-making-industry-forever/" title="">aluminium can manufacturing</a>: recent stories have promised massive transformation in them all.

(Although taken literally, it is, because history never unfolds in absolutes: for example, it’s always jarring to be reminded that most people spent the Great Depression in work, not unemployed.) Rather, it’s the implication that life, in years to come, is going to <em>feel </em>very different indeed. And one of the few things we can be pretty sure of is that it won’t. For most of us, most of the time, it’ll feel normal.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/19/life-in-a-post-coronavirus-world-will-it-feel-so-very-different">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Ahead of Windrush day, Orwell shortlisted writers Evaristo and Amelia Gentleman talk about politics, art and giving a voice to the powerless </p><p><strong>AG: </strong><strong>How do you feel about the label “political fiction”? Is there, </strong><strong>for a novelist, a wariness about it?</strong></p><p>BE: The interesting thing is that I’m not usually called a political writer. And I <em>am</em> a political writer! There is a political underpinning to&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/may/08/girl-woman-other-by-bernardine-evaristo-review">Girl, Woman, Other</a></em>, which is to explore as many black British women as possible in a single novel. The intention is for the reader to enjoy the book on the level of story, but at the same time, they’re engaging with all these issues. This is my eighth book, and all of them have been very political in terms of the ideas, the context of my characters and the subversive way in which I’m exploring the Afro-diasporic experience and black British history and society. But the context for my work has altered. After I won the Booker in October, everything changed. People are reading my book now, irrespective of the labels that are imposed on it. So, I’m not concerned that seeing it as “political fiction” will challenge people to such an extent that they won’t want to read it.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/19/bernardine-evaristo-its-shocking-that-people-dont-understand-britains-involvement-in-slavery">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The loaf cake has become a staple of lockdown baking – but from tangy ketchup to katsu curry, there are plenty of other ways to get the best from your bunch</p><p>It’s hard to argue with the enduring appeal of banana bread. Provided you have a few ageing bananas hanging around, it’s easy to throw together with other ingredients you’re likely to have. What’s more, it’s perfectly acceptable to eat at any time of day and, thanks to those ageing bananas, it stays moist and toothsome for days longer than most other cakes.</p><p>In spite of its timelessness, however, banana bread has had a serious moment during lockdown.

<p>Tiger Woods’ niece on her experiences of racism, the Black Lives Matter movement and coming to terms with her career path</p><p>Cheyenne Woods could write an ultimate guide to preconception. Choosing a career in golf, when her uncle happens to be the most famous player of all time, led to brickbats of which she was immediately aware. From junior golf, through college and into the professional ranks, the murmur has been consistent – including from fellow players.</p><p>“It was difficult to accept that I was deserving of some of the comments I received,” Woods says. “‘She only gets attention or support because of her last name.’ I had to totally disregard that. I am appreciative of the support, and I play golf because I love it.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/19/cheyenne-woods-interview-golf-dominated-white-men-tiger-woods-blm-protests">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Younger generations have accepted extraordinary constraints to protect us from coronavirus. We can’t justify a system that favours wealthy pensioners</p><p>A volcanic eruption is about to explode the government’s triple lock on pensions. There is no way the Tories can or will keep their pledge/bribe, introduced by the coalition government in 2011, to guarantee the state pension will <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2017/apr/27/pensions-triple-lock-questions-answered">always rise by either 2.5%</a>, the rate of average national earnings growth or the rate of inflation, whichever is higher. The policy was maintained during a decade of near-stagnant incomes for most. Abandoning it – however rational and inevitable in these extraordinary economic times – will hurt. With the political stage strewn with Covid-19 memorials to older people who died partly through the neglect of care homes, this risks marking the end of Tory hegemony over the pensioner vote.</p><p>Here’s why the triple lock’s future is in question.

Next year, with luck, many people will see incomes bounce back, while others will be unemployed with no earnings to count; if average earnings soar, freakishly, by 18%, then pensioners get an 18% rise too in a dismal recession for most.

<p>Harrison is fabulously alert to the spaces between things in this novel of collapsing certainties in a haunted England</p><p>Towards the end of the last century, there was a spate of haunted London novels, by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/apr/24/featuresreviews.guardianreview14">Iain Sinclair</a>, Peter Ackroyd and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chrispetit">Chris Petit</a> among others. Broadly psychogeographic in nature, they featured middle-aged men washed up on the outer reaches of the Thames, part of the detritus of a city ravaged by Thatcherism. In 1989, the science fiction writer M John Harrison took this mood and drove it out of London, crash-landing in the Yorkshire hills with the magnificently unsettling <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/10/robert-macfarlane-rereading-climbers">Climbers</a></em>, a novel about an unhappy exile named Mike struggling to keep his footing among a group of temerarious local climbers.</p><p>Harrison described this real, gritty world with the same precise and estranging fluency with which he has more often mapped galactic space, using the dense idiolect of climbing to make atmosphere and geology resonate on an emotional, interior level. Some kind of breach or fault line was being cautiously staked out, a post-industrial, late-capitalist collapse in credit and confidence so amorphous and inarticulable that it would vanish altogether if apprehended too directly.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/19/the-sunken-land-begins-to-rise-again-by-m-john-harrison-review-brilliantly-unsettling">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The amount of drive-by spending enabled just by leaving the house is shocking. Why so many cabs and coffees? </p><p>In March in the US, at the start of the pandemic, federal tax deadlines were pushed back to July. This three-month extension, intended to give us a break, means that many of us are compiling our spreadsheets this week. It’s never a happy experience, being reminded of just how much money flew out of your account on things that a year later you’d quite like to put back. This year, however, it’s more unsettling than usual. Going through my credit card bills this week was like watching recovered movie footage from a lost civilisation.</p><p>Spending habits have changed radically since March, through a combination of necessity, lack of opportunity and a change in psychology, and it’s those last two that are most glaringly surreal.

He became adored by film-makers and casting directors as the real deal, a tough guy whose tattoos alone were enough to terrify. He rose from non-speaking parts (billed as Inmate #1, Gangbanger #1 etc) to speaking roles in movies such as Heat, Desperado, Con Air and family movies including Spy Kids; his gift for granite-faced black comedy in Robert Rodriguez’s Mexploitation film Machete made him a legend. He also became a friend of ex-con, pulp novelist and actor Eddie Bunker (Mr Blue in Reservoir Dogs), who probably deserves a documentary of his own. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/19/inmate-1-the-rise-of-danny-trejo-review-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government must provide extra financial support for students and graduates who don’t have family to help them out</p><p>As the Covid-19 crisis took hold of the nation, there was a mass exodus of students from university campuses as most followed orders to go home. Yet for around 8,000 young people without family networks to rely on, it wasn’t so easy. These students had no choice but to remain on campus and live in the eerie remnants of what was once a thriving academic population. There is no doubt they are vulnerable: survivors of abuse, trauma, LGBT+ rejection and severely challenging family dynamics.</p><p>Not only have these students lost their community, but <a href="http://www.thestandalonepledge.org.uk/images/thestandalonepledge/filer/Financial_survey_analysis_-_with_case_study.pdf">new survey data</a> shows that they have also lost their jobs. This is troubling as we know that students who have no family support rely heavily on part-time work to meet their living costs – and these problems will become even more acute as we move into the summer period. My own research has consistently found that young people who are estranged from family rely on full-time work over the summer to meet the entirety of their living costs since there is no statutory finance.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/19/students-estranged-from-their-families-could-end-up-destitute-this-summer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Romeo and Juliet become online daters unable to meet in a new project that celebrates freelance creatives</p><p>When the UK went into lockdown in March, a tempest of tweets shared the heartening (or is that daunting?) observation that Shakespeare wrote King Lear during plague quarantine. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/mar/22/shakespeare-in-lockdown-did-he-write-king-lear-in-plague-quarantine">Whether true or not</a>, the suggestion led theatre director Nadia Papachronopoulou to conceive an online drama series that imagines Shakespeare’s characters in modern-day isolation. The project puts a new spin on familiar stories and is, she says, a celebration of the arts’ huge freelance workforce, which has been rocked by a period of instability as the pandemic threatens the industry’s future.</p><p>To make Shakespeare in Isolation, she assembled two dozen freelancers from theatre and television, including past colleagues and new collaborators. The four short films, directed by Papachronopoulou, have a playful “modern twist”. Shakespeare’s star-crossed lovers Romeo and Juliet are reimagined by writer Lisa Keddie as embarking on a relationship online, unable to meet in person due to pandemic restrictions. Chris Woodley turns Ophelia into a Spice Girls superfan who is trying to concentrate on self-care while avoiding texts from Hamlet.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/19/a-midsummer-nights-zoom-isolation-shakespeare">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The mood in the seaside town of Warnemünde is upbeat as tourism begins to recover, but foreign visitors are still thin on the ground despite the opening of Germany’s borders this week</p><p><em><br /></em>It’s the middle of June and it feels like a perfect summer day in Warnemünde. The pretty canal-side promenade is thronged with people eating fish and chips out of paper cones and gorging on soft Danish ice-cream (a speciality here). Gaudy tour boats drift breezily along the canal every few minutes, and shops selling everything from surfing gear and jewellery to locally made clothing have their wares out on show on the cobbled streets. The terraces of the town centre’s many cafes and fish restaurants also seem full, with people basking in the sunshine. The only obvious signs that the Coronavirus is still with us are the masks worn by shopkeepers and service staff.</p><p>This small German town, officially part of Rostock, with its quaint fisherman cottages, striking 19<sup>th</sup>-century lighthouse and sweeping two-mile beach lapped by beautifully clear water, is one of many pearls strung along the country’s Baltic coast, or Ostsee (East Sea) as it’s known here.

<p>At 77 and holed up in lockdown, the veteran director and latterday actor shows no signs of slowing down or accepting any limitations</p><p>The digital world, what a fabulous place, <a href="https://www.wernerherzog.com/">Werner Herzog</a> declares from his home in Los Angeles. Fraught with danger. Filled with possibility. It is thanks to digital that he can stream his films to audiences in Africa and Asia, despite the fact that the theatres are closed. It is thanks to digital that he can receive an email from a student in Missoula, Montana and respond to her question in less than a minute. It is thanks to digital that we are able to converse over Skype, peering into each other’s houses from a 5,000-mile distance. “So this is wonderful,” he cries. “Wonderful, wonderful!” Then the connection cuts out and I have to dial his number again.</p><p>We were meant to meet in person , but the pandemic intervened. As a director, Herzog goes about life like a pith-helmeted explorer – dragging his camera to the mouth of volcanoes, hauling a steamship up a Peruvian mountain. But he is 77 and slap-bang in the Covid-19 danger zone, and accepts that now is the time to sit tight, wait it out. The lion in winter. Napoleon stuck on Elba. I am picturing him bouncing off the walls or staring into the abyss, but he insists he’s doing fine, staying positive. “I’m constantly being made fun of as this terrible doom-sayer. The dour German. But this is not the whole story,” he says. Herzog contains multitudes. He suspects that most people do.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/19/werner-herzog-im-fascinated-by-trash-tv-the-poet-must-not-avert-his-eyes">Continue reading...</a>

So why has Trump chosen Tulsa?</p><p>Donald Trump will hold his first election rally since the coronavirus lockdown in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Saturday. As thousands of his supporters descend on an indoor sports arena, the event has been widely criticised for risking a new rise in Covid-19 infections as well as stoking racial tensions. </p><p>The Guardian’s <strong>Oliver Laughland </strong>joins <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>from Tulsa. Oliver looks back to 1921, where Greenwood, Tulsa was the site of one of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/trumps-visit-tulsa-spurs-renewed-call-1921-racial-massacre-reparations">worst episodes of racial violence in US history</a>. He discusses why Trump chose to hold his comeback rally in this location. We also hear from <strong>Brenda Alford</strong>, whose grandfather’s business was burned to the ground in 1921 and <strong>Andre Harris</strong>, brother of Eric Harris, an unarmed 44-year-old African American man who was shot and killed by a white reserve sheriff’s deputy, Robert Bates in 2015. Harris points out that just as in 1921 when the sheriff’s office conscripted members of a lynch mob to wreak havoc in Greenwood, it was a volunteer white officer that killed his brother.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/19/why-is-trumps-comeback-rally-in-tulsa-the-site-of-a-massacre">Continue reading...</a>
