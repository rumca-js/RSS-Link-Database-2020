I had an expensive education, but sadly I learned very little about black history at school; by my early 20s, only names such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">Frederick Douglass</a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/03/harriet-tubman-she-came-to-slay-erica-armstrong-dunbar-interview\">Harriet Tubman</a> still rang a bell. All that changed when I discovered that Stowe\u2019s novel was based on the life of a real man, named Josiah Henson, whose cabin in Ontario was just a few hours from my home.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/19/josiah-henson-the-forgotten-story-slavery-uncle-tom-s-cabin\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/19/josiah-henson-the-forgotten-story-slavery-uncle-tom-s-cabin", "date_published": "2020-06-19 14:27:24+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Barrow rape claims trial faces long delay due to coronavirus backlog", "description": "<p>Teenager\u2019s trial on counts of fabricating sexual accusations set for August 2021</p><p>A 19-year-old woman from Barrow accused of making up allegations of sexual exploitation against five men may not stand trial until August 2021 because of legal delays caused by the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p>During the woman\u2019s appearance at Preston crown court on Friday, the judge explained that the lockdown was leading to huge backlogs in the judicial system.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jun/19/preston-court-blames-covid-19-backlog-as-teenager-remanded-in-jail-for-14-months\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2020/jun/19/preston-court-blames-covid-19-backlog-as-teenager-remanded-in-jail-for-14-months", "date_published": "2020-06-19 14:24:37+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "This is Boris Johnson's midlife crisis. The rest of us just have to live in it | Marina Hyde", "description": "<p>A \u00a3900k plane respray, a dirt bike and two new royal yachts. A Celtic knot tattoo on the prime ministerial arm cannot be far off </p><p>A strong sense of empires crumbling this week, as Led Zeppelin are no longer the biggest dickheads ever to demand a plane respray. Sliding into the top spot are Boris Johnson and his government, with the prime minister taking time out of accidentally bumping off British citizens to order a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/17/paint-job-on-boris-johnson-plane-will-cost-taxpayer-900000-pounds\">\u00a3900,000 paint job on his VIP Voyager aircraft</a>.<br /><br />The only disappointment is that he didn\u2019t reveal the plans at one of the daily No 10 press conferences. Here\u2019s a slide showing how tens of thousands more people than necessary have Sadly Died because of decisions I took or put off taking. But looking at the positives, here\u2019s a slide of the new designs for my plane! As for the respray, I\u2019m picturing something that befits our status in the world. Perhaps giant letters reading \u201cAir Farce One\u201d. The budget option would be to keep it grey and just scrawl a classic across the side, like \u201cCLEAN ME\u201d or \u201cMy plane is dirtier than your mum\u201d. If not, maybe Johnson would be drawn to something like \u201cIf this plane\u2019s a-rockin\u2019, don\u2019t come a-knockin\u2019\u201d, or \u201cDon\u2019t laugh, lady \u2013 your daughter could be in here\u201d.<br /><br />None of these would be any less absurd than the justification for it all by cabinet minister Oliver Dowden. I note that Oliver is a Conservative culture secretary, which has historically been like being the Ku Klux Klan\u2019s equalities wizard. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/17/paint-job-on-boris-johnson-plane-will-cost-taxpayer-900000-pounds\">Here he is</a> on Johnson\u2019s paint job: \u201cWe really are a creative industries superpower, and we should be promoting that. I think the work on Voyager is part of that.\u201d To which the most reasonable reply is: wut? Still, let\u2019s try to clamber inside the logic simulator and work out what \u2013 in the name of his favourite album being a free CD that came on the front of the Sunday Times in 2007 \u2013 Oliver is trying to say here. Is it that theatres are in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/17/cultural-catastrophe-uk-theatre-faces-ruin-amid-coronavirus-crisis\">such acute crisis</a> that 75% of them may never reopen, so we need to get this piece of military hardware into the bodyshop? Is it that we made Fleabag, and that\u2019s why my boss needs a penis extension? I\u2019m finding the philosophy somewhat impenetrable.<br /><br />Then again, Johnson has always seen some mystical correlation between his sense of sexual potency and the success of the nation. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jun/06/johnson-accuses-corbyn-of-siding-with-uks-enemies-in-fight-on-terror\">previously fretted</a> that Trident going to sea without missiles would mean \u201cthe whole country is literally firing blanks\u201d. He has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/oct/06/voters-back-trustworthy-theresa-may-boris-johnson-leadership-campaign\">described himself</a> as the man \u201cto put some lead in the collective pencil\u201d. And he\u2019d now like us \u201cto have a chlorinated chicken in every port\u201d. Actually, I think I invented that last one \u2013 but you\u2019re welcome for the image. We\u2019re all men of the world, and no one said dockside life was for the faint-hearted.<br /><br />Speaking of grotesque maritime adventures, it feels the moment to turn to one minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/boris-johnson-penny-mordaunt-royal-yachts-overseas-aid-money-a9572376.html\">widely publicised letter</a> to Johnson this week in the wake of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/dec/19/aid-groups-warn-boris-johnson-against-combining-dfid-with-foreign-office\">shameful decision to merge</a> the Department for International Development with the Foreign Office. This requested that the government spend money intended for overseas aid on two new yachts to replace the Royal Yacht Britannia.<br /><br />The letter was written by Penny Mordaunt, hitherto one of the less lavishly useless ones. When Dominic Cummings broke lockdown to drive to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight and so on, Tory MPs were swamped by furious constituents. Mordaunt <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/27/inconsistencies-dominic-cummings-story-senior-tory-penny-mordaunt-lockdown\">went on record</a> to offer them her \u201cdeepest regrets\u201d and say that there were \u201csome inconsistencies in his account of events and the reasons behind it\u201d. In the immediate wake of this, a \u201cwell-placed observer\u201d <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/official-inquiry-into-dominic-cummings-would-be-waste-of-time-says-boris-johnson-kh2pbg8wj\">told the Times</a>: \u201cDom is very vindictive. I think someone like Penny \u2013 she\u2019s fucked. I know how they operate and she is in big trouble. They will go after her.\u201d<br /><br />Alternatively, she might have to pass some mad loyalty test, like having to execute a snitch in an abandoned warehouse in front of her crime boss \u2013 or write a letter saying that aid money has to be spent on a yacht. Sorry, two yachts. That, I imagine, is when you lower the gun you were handed, shaking with a mixture of horror, fear, relief (maybe even a tiny trace of exhilaration), and Cummings claps you on the back and goes: \u201cThat it\u2019s, Pen. Always knew you were one of us.\u201d<br /><br />In terms of cultural exports, of course, we are now a country where the foreign secretary <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/18/dominic-raab-taking-the-knee-feels-like-symbol-of-subjugation\">informs the world</a> that Black Lives Matter protesters\u2019 taking a knee \u201cseems to be taken from the Game of Thrones\u201d [sic]. Domestically, the DfId/FCO merger is a culture war gambit that reminds us this government will be coming for the BBC soon enough. In that act of cultural vandalism, they will be assisted by various quarterwits on the left who want to privatise a utility currently owned by the public, and who believe that a strong, independent leftwing media will spring up in its place. Just like it has in all the other countries.<br /><br />Still, no doubt the politicians can visit these on their royal yacht replacement. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t yet know the purpose of the second yacht Mordaunt has requested. Maybe some kind of human ark? There may come a point where Johnson\u2019s administration has wiped out so many British citizens that the only way for us to survive as a world-beating master race is to take to the high seas \u2013 and they will get higher, if he has his way \u2013 where a retinue of women will be impregnated by one hugely self-regarding enthusiast. I can\u2019t imagine who.<br /><br />In the meantime, surely it\u2019s time to point out that if a telly chef was behaving like Johnson, you know what people would be saying. Let\u2019s look at the evidence: the chap in question has left his wife for someone very much younger. He has recently acquired a dirt bike on which to bomb round the grounds of Chequers. He now wants not one but three ludicrously showy high-performance vehicles. Come on \u2013 does the prime minister have to get a Celtic knot tattoo before we can call what\u2019s happening by its name? Does Johnson have to casually push up his sleeve at the dispatch box to reveal a newly inked piece of Route 66 body art, then say to Keir Starmer \u201cI\u2019m headed for the open road of life, mate\u201d? Does he have to be spotted in a terrible leather jacket? Do a triathlon? Learn to surf? If it were anyone else in public life, then the Daily Mail\u2019s Sarah Vine would have written 15 columns about it, so allow me to \u201cgo there\u201d on her behalf: the prime minister is having an incredibly cliched midlife crisis, and we\u2019re all having to live in it.<br /><br />If this was Bake Off\u2019s Paul Hollywood, then fine. I myself would get a couple of columns out of it; and in any case he\u2019s only in charge of a baking tent, a Kawasaki Ninja and a semi-custom Big Dog Ridgeback (I\u2019m told it doesn\u2019t ride as good as it looks). But when they\u2019re in charge of an entire country, shambolic pandemic response and some nuclear codes, it does feel like something we should all keep an eye on. A powerless one, yes: but still an eye.</p><p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/19/boris-johnson-midlife-crisis-plane-respray-royal-yachts\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/19/boris-johnson-midlife-crisis-plane-respray-royal-yachts", "date_published": "2020-06-19 14:02:02+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "I can't stand my in-laws.

So why has Trump chosen Tulsa?</p><p>Donald Trump will hold his first election rally since the coronavirus lockdown in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Saturday. As thousands of his supporters descend on an indoor sports arena, the event has been widely criticised for risking a new rise in Covid-19 infections as well as stoking racial tensions. </p><p>The Guardian\u2019s <strong>Oliver Laughland </strong>joins <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>from Tulsa. Oliver looks back to 1921, where Greenwood, Tulsa was the site of one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/18/trumps-visit-tulsa-spurs-renewed-call-1921-racial-massacre-reparations\">worst episodes of racial violence in US history</a>. He discusses why Trump chose to hold his comeback rally in this location. We also hear from <strong>Brenda Alford</strong>, whose grandfather\u2019s business was burned to the ground in 1921 and <strong>Andre Harris</strong>, brother of Eric Harris, an unarmed 44-year-old African American man who was shot and killed by a white reserve sheriff\u2019s deputy, Robert Bates in 2015. Harris points out that just as in 1921 when the sheriff\u2019s office conscripted members of a lynch mob to wreak havoc in Greenwood, it was a volunteer white officer that killed his brother.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/19/why-is-trumps-comeback-rally-in-tulsa-the-site-of-a-massacre\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/19/why-is-trumps-comeback-rally-in-tulsa-the-site-of-a-massacre", "date_published": "2020-06-19 02:00:05+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Trump again threatens to cut China ties after US official ruled it out", "description": "<p>President contradicts top China trade negotiator as Washington questions Beijing Covid-19 outbreak numbers</p><p>Donald Trump has renewed his threat to cut ties with China, a day after his diplomats held high-level talks with Beijing and his top US trade negotiator said severing the trade relationship was not a viable option.</p><p>The conflicting stances emerged as Washington questioned China\u2019s credibility on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/18/global-report-beijing-covid-19-cluster-may-have-begun-a-month-earlier-china-health-chief\">accurately reporting the new Covid-19 cluster in Beijing.</a></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/trump-again-threatens-to-cut-china-ties-after-us-official-ruled-it-out\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/19/trump-again-threatens-to-cut-china-ties-after-us-official-ruled-it-out", "date_published": "2020-06-19 01:29:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "China releases 10 Indian soldiers after border clash - report", "description": "<p>Indian media report release came after high-level talks between the India army and the PLA</p><p>China has freed 10 Indian soldiers seized in a high-altitude border clash in the Himalayas which left at least 20 Indian soldiers dead, media reports said on Friday.</p><p>The release follows several rounds of talks between the two sides in a bid to ease tensions after the battle on Monday, in which scores of troops from the two sides fought with nail-studded batons and hurled rocks at each other.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/19/china-releases-ten-indian-soldiers-after-border-clash-report\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/19/china-releases-ten-indian-soldiers-after-border-clash-report", "date_published": "2020-06-19 00:01:43+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}]
