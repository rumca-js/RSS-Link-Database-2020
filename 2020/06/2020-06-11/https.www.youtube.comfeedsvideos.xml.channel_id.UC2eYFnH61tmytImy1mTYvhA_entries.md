Why whine about Google or meme alternative search engines when you can just make your own with Searx? (https://searx.me). If you don't even trust public instances of Searx (https://searx.space/) you can install it on your own webserver in less than 10 minutes. I use a Debian server running nginx in this video, but it should work on other distros like Ubuntu and on Apache servers as well. You can also customize search settings and do whatever you want.

This is the power of Free/Libre Software!

Searx is based. Comparing it to DuckDuckGo and You-Know-Who-gle there's no contest. It aggregates and integrates results from different search engines all without your local machine connecting to them. There are equivalents of DDG !bangtags and you have a lot of say in what engines are used. While it check out https://searx.space for a list of Searx instances, but you can even run a Searx instance on your own server if you don't trust anyone else.
