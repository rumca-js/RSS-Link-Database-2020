(https://searx.me). If you don't even trust public instances of Searx (https://searx.space/) you can install it on your own webserver in less than 10 minutes. I use a Debian server running nginx in this video, but it should work on other distros like Ubuntu and on Apache servers as well. You can also customize search settings and do whatever you want.\n\nThis is the power of Free/Libre Software!\n\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\nDONATE: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://brave.com/luk005 Get the Brave browser.\nhttps://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke View my videos on LBRY.\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/join/smith_5to1 Get crypto-rich on Coinbase.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oufXi3e-VuA", "date_published": "2020-06-12 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC2eYFnH61tmytImy1mTYvhA", "title": "The Proper Way to Do Web Searches (Searx)", "description": "Searx is based. Comparing it to DuckDuckGo and You-Know-Who-gle there's no contest. It aggregates and integrates results from different search engines all without your local machine connecting to them. There are equivalents of DDG !bangtags and you have a lot of say in what engines are used. While it check out https://searx.space for a list of Searx instances, but you can even run a Searx instance on your own server if you don't trust anyone else.\n\nWEBSITE: https://lukesmith.xyz \ud83c\udf10\u2753\ud83d\udd0e\nDONATE: https://lukesmith.xyz/donate \ud83d\udcb0\ud83d\ude0e\ud83d\udc4c\ud83d\udcaf\nOR affiliate links to things l use:\nhttps://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6 Get a cheap and reliable domain name with Epik.\nhttps://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G Get a VPS and host a website or server for anything else.\nhttps://brave.com/luk005 Get the Brave browser.\nhttps://lbry.tv/$/invite/@Luke View my videos on LBRY.\nhttps://www.coinbase.com/join/smith_5to1 Get crypto-rich on Coinbase.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rkv4rrdFBU0", "date_published": "2020-06-11 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
