## Sevilla 2-0 Real Betis: La Liga resumes after shutdown - as it happened!

Second place shouldn’t be a pipe dream, not quite yet, though it’s extremely unlikely that both of the leaders will slip up and gift Sevilla their first La Liga title since 1946. Closing in on Champions League football is the important thing, and they’ve taken their first step tonight, throwing the gauntlet down at the feet of Real Sociedad, Getafe, Atletico Madrid and Valencia. Real Betis meanwhile remain in 12th, eight clear of relegation bother. Anyway, thanks for reading this MBM, and welcome back La Liga!

## PlayStation 5: Sony reveals PS5 console and games – as it happened

<p>Join us as we cover the PlayStation 5 announcement live from 9pm BST/1pm PDT</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-06-11T21:42:51.882Z">10.42pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p>Well, that’s it for the PlayStation 5 event this evening. Clearly, the focus was on games rather than hardware – at least until the end – and fans got what they wanted, beginning with an enhanced GTA V and moving on through new Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, Hitman and Ratchet &amp; Clank titles. The finale was the reveal of the PlayStation 5 console itself, a radical re-think of the machine’s lineage, abandoning the all black colouring we’ve seen in the last three machines in favour of a futuristic white and black monolith.</p><p>Compared to the recent Xbox Series X games stream, which focused on original indie titles, this was something of a fan-pleasing big brand onslaught from Sony. But we’re yet to discover how many of these titles are exclusives, or even timed exclusives, beyond the first party games.</p><p class="block-time published-time"> <time datetime="2020-06-11T21:22:52.833Z">10.22pm <span class="timezone">BST</span></time> </p><p>They saved it right til the end, but Sony has finally revealed the form factor of the PlayStation 5, an ultra futuristic robot white machine, with gliding lines and a black central stratum. This is a really radical look, like something out of an Alex Garland script. The console will come in two versions: a standard model and a digital machine. It’ll be accompanied by a 3D camera. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/live/2020/jun/11/sony-reveals-the-playstation-5">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Made with the full involvement of both the divisive politician and those around her, Nanette Burstein’s four-part docuseries is an exercise in controlled blandness</p><p>Nanette Burstein’s series documentary&nbsp;Hillary&nbsp;(Sky Documentaries) is a four-hour portrait of probably the most famous and divisive female figure in modern politics. It was assembled from more than 2,000 hours of backstage footage from her 2016 election drive, interviews with 45 of the people who know her best (from childhood friends to her campaign aides, alongside her daughter Chelsea and – I don’t know if you remember this guy but – her husband Bill) and 35 hours of face-to-face interviews with the woman herself. It interweaves the story of the fateful election with her personal history, recapping her upbringing as the child of staunch Republican Methodist parents, her academic brilliance, the influence of second wave feminism, her professional success as a lawyer and her marriage. There is, of course, much on her political career and the media narratives that have been endlessly constructed and deconstructed around her, as the peaks (such as beating Bernie Sanders in Iowa) and troughs (oh dear God, the troughs) of the campaign trail are navigated.</p><p>Everything you would expect to be here is here. The problem is that this four-hour portrait has the full involvement of its subject and sanctioned cooperation of everyone around her. We have the friends who attest to her early interest in public service, the professor who talks of her pragmatic, problem-solving attitude and fierce intelligence. The Whitewater scandal is noted, but only&nbsp;Clinton’s disbelief at the subsequent conspiracy theories are given any airtime. The Monica Lewinsky revelations are raked over – Bill teary-eyed with regret at “the things I did for years to manage my anxieties” – as we see the former communications director marvelling at&nbsp;Hillary’s courage during the fallout.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/11/hillary-review-clinton-swerves-the-big-questions">Continue reading...</a>

<ul><li>Englishman hits blemish-free 63 at Charles Schwab Challenge </li><li>Tournament starts with silence in honour of George Floyd</li></ul><p>The PGA Tour’s defining moment of a new beginning did not involve Rory McIlroy. Justin Rose’s 63 was notable but not the abiding memory from golf’s re-emergence.</p><p>Jay Monahan, the Tour’s commissioner, stood with head bowed on the 1st tee at Colonial as the clock struck 8.46am. This pre-planned moment of reflection was introduced – and shall remain for the next three days of the Charles Schwab Challenge – following the appalling death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Monahan earlier stated his Tour “commits to amplifying voices and efforts to end systemic issues of racial and social injustices”. It will take more than golf to heal the gaping race relations wound in the United States but this sport – where white males dominate – appears to have discovered a new level of consciousness. Actions speak far louder than 60 seconds of poignancy and a stoppage in play but this was continuation of what appears a genuinely held Monahan theme.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/jun/11/justin-rose-shines-as-golf-returns-after-91-day-enforced-absence">Continue reading...</a>

## Mattbeth's vaulting ambition leads him out to damn'd TV spot | John Crace

<p>It was clear Hancock’s news on track and trace would not be good, or else Boris would have given it</p><p>You could tell the news wasn’t going to be that great when we got the cast list. If the new track and trace system had been an overwhelming success, there would have been every chance that Boris Johnson would have rolled out of bed to take the credit. Instead, we got Matt Hancock, everybody’s favourite punchbag, still wearing his favourite pink tie that has so far brought him nothing but bad luck.</p><p>It’s hard not to feel just a little sorry for Matt. His vaulting ambition that led him to ignore all his gut instincts about having nothing to do with a Boris Johnson government has brought him nothing but hubris. He knew Boris was a wrong ‘un from the off. He even said as much during his short-lived campaign to be Tory party leader last summer. But when faced with a choice of acting on principle or grasping whatever cabinet post was going begging, Mattbeth chose the latter.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/11/novelty-of-being-on-tv-wears-off-for-matt-hancock-as-he-defends-app">Continue reading...</a>

## Gulabo Sitabo review - mildewed mansion drama bustles and crumbles

<p>Amitabh Bachchan and Ayushmann Khurrana star in Shoojit Sircar’s puzzling tale of class and property management </p><p>The first big Indian release of 2020 to divert towards streaming is an offbeam, strangely mismanaged parable about property management that renders its stars all but unrecognisable. The established Amitabh Bachchan is buried beneath old-age latex and thick-lensed glasses; emergent pin-up Ayushmann Khurrana is weighed down by a (presumably prosthetic) middle-aged spread. However director Shoojit Sircar’s gaze keeps drifting beyond them, to a location you couldn’t make-under: a mildewing Lucknow mansion house, lorded over by Bachchan’s shuffling miser Mirza, ever looking for ways to kick Khurrana’s collected waifs-and-strays to the kerb. The curious, altogether tentative drama that ensues may be as close as any film-maker has come to signing off on a Hindi redo of TV’s Rising Damp.</p><p>Alas, it’s also one of those cases where forced idiosyncrasy tries the patience from an early stage. With 2015’s sharp, breezy Piku and 2018’s delicate but involving October, Sircar had nudged Indian commercial cinema in a rewarding, naturalistic direction; but this just feels like a strain. A laboured first half scopes out the characters’ dingy surrounds without threatening to go anywhere, and feet are apparently being dragged because Sircar and generally reliable screenwriter Juhi Chaturvedi aren’t themselves sure which direction to move in. Brakes are soon applied to the mounting narrative of landlord-tenant class war – “Parasite!”, yells Mirza, reminding us of a more decisive film on a similar subject – in favour of a softer landing as both antagonists fall prey to creeping gentrification.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/11/gulabo-sitabo-review-amitabh-bachchan-ayushmann-khurrana-shoojit-sircar-drama">Continue reading...</a>

In the period of coalition government after 2010, David Cameron stitched up deals in a four-man “quad”. But under Boris Johnson, the aggregation of power in Downing Street is unprecedented.

## To honour George Floyd, we must learn the lessons of the Lawrence inquiry | Matthew Ryder

<p>A focus on accountability for police treatment of black people should be our first priority</p><p>Outrage at the killing of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd">George Floyd</a> by a police officer in Minneapolis has spread across the world in recent weeks. The horrific images of a man killed by a knee to his neck have resonated with cases of lethal injustice closer to home. In Britain, among the names that come to mind is that of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence">Stephen Lawrence</a>, the black teenager whose murder by white youths and the bungled investigation into it exposed the racism of our most powerful police force.&nbsp;But earlier this week Neville Lawrence, Stephen’s father, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain">spoke publicly</a> to remind us not only why that case was so important, but also of the danger of losing focus on what it taught us.</p><p>It is not surprising that&nbsp;many&nbsp;of the most important moments in US and UK race relations in the last 50 years have been triggered by racist mistreatment of black people by police. Interaction with the police – where life itself can be at risk – is where the most vivid, tragic and&nbsp;incendiary incidents often occur.<br /><br />Despite that,&nbsp;there are still some who&nbsp;mistakenly suggest that events in the US have&nbsp;no&nbsp;relevance to the UK. They will point out that while black deaths from police contact occur often in the US, they are comparatively rare in the UK. But that analysis misses the point: black people in the US and UK share very similar experiences of policing and racism, in the context of racial profiling, disproportionate stop-and-search, and excessive use of force. Just as importantly, they also&nbsp;suffer as a result of the perception in wider society that black people are threatening and dangerous. It is&nbsp;an ugly, deeply entrenched stereotype&nbsp;that blights the lives of black people in both places. For those white British people who look at George Floyd’s death and think, “That’s tragic, but it’s nothing to do with how black people are treated here,” just look at the thousands who have<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/now-is-the-time-londons-black-lives-matter-rally-looks-like-a-turning-point"> attended marches</a> in London, or ask some black British people and see what they say. They will tell you that his death means something here because the problems in the relationship between black people and police in both countries is similar and is in urgent need of resolution.<br /><br />One of the great legacies of the Stephen Lawrence case is that now, when issues of racism gain public attention in the UK, many of us reach for what we learned from&nbsp;the Stephen Lawrence inquiry.&nbsp;It was&nbsp;chaired&nbsp;by&nbsp;Sir&nbsp;William Macpherson, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/macpherson-report-what-was-it-and-what-impact-did-it-have">concluded in 1999</a>, six years after Stephen’s death. It gave us a new vocabulary and a new way to understand how “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/feb/22/institutional-racism-britain-stephen-lawrence-inquiry-20-years">institutional racism</a>” permeated the police, many public bodies and much of modern British society. It taught us that what happened to Stephen, both at the hands of the racists that murdered him and the police who failed in their investigations, was actually part of a much broader problem with society as a whole.&nbsp;<br /><br />But perhaps in a well-intentioned effort to put those lessons into effect, British society’s reaction to George&nbsp;Floyd’s&nbsp;killing has moved almost immediately from what should be a call to action on tackling&nbsp;accountability and racism in the context of policing&nbsp;to a much wider, broader discussion about racism in all its forms. On TV, radio and online, George Floyd has prompted general conversations about diversity and inequality.&nbsp;Following the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest">toppling of the statue</a> of notorious slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, debates on the monuments of empire and colonialism have resurfaced.&nbsp;In contrast, conversations about racism in policing, and specifically how it affects black people like George Floyd in the UK, are in danger of getting lost.<br /><br />Going quickly to the bigger picture can feel like a sophisticated understanding of the wider implications of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. In reality, it misunderstands how the inquiry approached its task and what made its findings so powerful. The inquiry only got to those broader issues at a later stage. Its first priority – that remained a touchstone throughout – was to focus on the investigation of Stephen’s death and racism in the specific context of black people and policing, before moving on to wider issues of racism in society as a whole. Its detailed recommendations, that led to lasting change, only occurred because of that initial focus.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/09/neville-lawrence-black-people-still-second-class-citizens-in-britain">Neville Lawrence</a> spoke out this week, as both he and Stephen’s mother Doreen Lawrence have in the past, on why it is so important to remember the lessons about policing that the inquiry taught us. The truth is that there has not been sufficient change to policing since then.&nbsp;If we do not seize this moment of exceptional public concern&nbsp;over racism and police accountability,&nbsp;we will miss an extraordinary opportunity. The risk is that after much hand-wringing and general discussion, the specific problem of racism in the context of police mistreatment of black people will simply continue.<br /><br />The death of George Floyd, like the death of Stephen Lawrence, obliges us to recognise what makes this moment important. People of all ethnicities did not start protesting in Minneapolis because of the usual general concerns about people of colour – or in UK terminology BAME people – suffering various forms of discrimination. They took to the streets because they saw that, yet again, a black man had been killed in public by police flagrantly using excessive force, and no one was being held accountable. That clarity over the convergence of race and police accountability should be the focus for our discussions.<br /><br />The Stephen Lawrence inquiry had it right: begin with attention to the narrower, specific issues that require immediate action, before opening out to the wider issues that affect society as a whole.&nbsp;Similarly, the organisers of the recent Black Lives Matter marches in the US and the UK put at the centre of all their activity the names of black men and women who had died or suffered through police and state violence, and the need to achieve justice for them.&nbsp;<br /><br />Of course, those involved in the Black Lives Matter movement understand, as most of us do, that all aspects of racism are connected. You cannot fully address one particular manifestation of it without eventually looking at the broader issues. But if we jump straight to talking about racism in all its forms without remembering where our focus is, we will fail to address the specific injustice that has prompted our concern in the first place.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/honour-george-floyd-learn-lessons-lawrence-inquiry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A collective failure to look the history of empire in the eye stops us from being the kind of country we could be</p><p>There were two historically striking things about Bristol’s statue of Edward Colston. The first, most obviously, was that the statue of a slave trader could still have had pride of place in a British city in 2020. The second, much less remarked, is that the statue was only erected there in 1895, fully 200 years after Colston’s life and almost 90 years after the abolition of the slave trade.</p><p>Why did the statue go up when it did? It wasn’t to celebrate slavery. It was because, at a time when Britain’s empire stretched around the globe, what seemed to matter most about Colston to the city’s rulers was not how he had got his riches but his enduring and formidable legacy of philanthropy. Like most late Victorian British cities, Bristol was governed by Gladstonian Liberals not by Tories. The Liberals abhorred slavery and extolled their abolitionist forebears. But they celebrated their own enlightenment, in the form of the charitable schools, hospitals and research centres that they endowed, even more.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/obsessing-over-statues-obscures-the-real-problem-britains-delusion-about-its-past">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As a new David Attenborough documentary examines the waterway’s history, we rate the river’s finest movie cameos </p><p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/jul/13/harrypotter.family">This film</a> follows a well-understood movie tradition of using the Thames, with its twists and turns and swerves, as a spectacular setpiece to whoosh us along the city, tracking the river from the air. Here, Harry (played by Daniel Radcliffe) has been expelled from Hogwarts and is under attack from Dementors, so “Mad-Eye” Moody (Brendan Gleeson) takes Harry and his pals on an amazing broomstick ride along the river, past the Canary Wharf towers and the museum ship HMS Belfast. Tower Bridge makes its mandatory appearance before Harry and the gang rocket past the Houses of Parliament and arrive in Grimmauld Place, the former headquarters of the titular Order of the Phoenix, somewhere north of the river.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/11/the-greatest-film-scenes-shot-on-the-river-thames-ranked">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Full of ideas and uncompromising about the world they want to live in, eight exceptional individuals have come together to have their say, their way</p><p>“It’s tough starting from the bottom and trying to work your way up,” says illustrator Chris Martin. The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with The Guardian.</p><p>Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says <a href="https://www.instagram.com/toe_rag/" rel="nofollow">Chris</a>. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and The Guardian Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-voice-your-way/2020/jun/11/this-is-our-future-how-eight-talented-young-creatives-found-their-voice">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Whether it’s climate change, homophobia or hidden talent, one of the best known brands in the world is stepping up to give people a voice</p><p>Some brands are so big, so ubiquitous, that it’s hard to imagine that they were once small businesses, or that the name on their instantly recognisable logo belonged to a real person. Levi Strauss was one of those real people. Born in Bavaria, Germany, he moved to the US in 1846. After seven years in New York, he headed to the west coast to join the gold rush, not as a prospector, but to set up a wholesale business, dealing in, among other goods, clothing.</p><p>In San Francisco he quickly became a respected businessman and, in 1873, struck gold himself when he spotted the potential of the hard-wearing riveted trousers being made for labourers by tailor Jacob Davis. The two men went into business together, as Levi Strauss &amp; Co, and before long were manufacturing thousands of pairs of blue jeans, the US workwear that went on to become a worldwide wardrobe staple.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-voice-your-way/2020/jun/11/good-jeans-the-man-who-gave-levis-a-social-conscience">Continue reading...</a>

<p>In a world where everyone has an opinion, how do you make sure your views see the limelight, especially when it seems that no one is listening? Here, three people who found their voices explain how you can do it<br /></p><p>It should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.</p><p>But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you’re on the margins? As part of Levi’s Your Voice.

<p>From maternal mortality to access to pain relief, minority-ethnic groups have always suffered disproportionately. But now the data on Covid-19 deaths cannot be ignored</p><p>One of the last things I did before lockdown began was to speak at the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists at an event on race and maternal mortality. It has been known for a few years now that – incredibly – black women in the UK are <a href="https://www.npeu.ox.ac.uk/mbrrace-uk/reports">five times more likely to die</a> in pregnancy than white women, while Asian women are twice as likely to die. The atmosphere in the room was heavy with anger and disappointment. Black doctors, nurses and midwives were exasperated by the failure to protect women.</p><p>In the United States, too, black and Native American women suffer greater rates of maternal mortality than white women. This is just one of many examples of racial inequality in health. A US study found last year that black patients were <a href="https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(19)30391-2/fulltext">40</a><a href="https://www.ajemjournal.com/article/S0735-6757(19)30391-2/fulltext">% less likely</a> than white patients to get the medication they needed to relieve acute pain.

<p>Black people account for 3% of the population, but 8% of deaths in custody. As a former chief prosecutor, I know this is only the end point of a system that disproportionately suspects, arrests, convicts and imprisons BAME people</p><p>In 1988, Christopher Alder, a former British army paratrooper, was injured during a fight and ended up in hospital. He was then arrested for a breach of the peace and<a href="https://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/news/hull-east-yorkshire-news/christopher-alder-george-floyd-death-4195831"> taken to Queens Gardens police station in Hull</a>. CCTV footage shows him lying face down on the floor of the station, motionless, with his trousers around his ankles. Officers stand around laughing while he lies there, dying, for 10 minutes.</p><p>Three years later, an inquest returned a verdict of unlawful killing – because the officers did nothing while, for three minutes of that time, Alder was unable to breathe. A year later, five police officers were prosecuted for manslaughter and misconduct in public office. All were acquitted on the direction of the judge. A review by the Independent Police Complaints Commission in 2006 concluded that four of the officers present were guilty of the “most serious neglect” and “unwitting racism”.

<p>Russian-born photographer Maria Quigley grew up in Britain. For this project she returned to her grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg to explore themes of memory, isolation and female identity across three generations of her family</p><p>The images in this series address questions of claustrophobic spaces. They convey a sense of being locked down, however they were taken last year before the emergence of Covid-19. They were snapped inside my grandmother’s small flat in St Petersburg, which for many years she has hardly left. As long as I can remember my grandmother’s world has conveyed a sense of being locked down. She leaves the flat once a week to get groceries and a TV guide from the shop directly below her apartment. In the winter she doesn’t leave the flat for three months because it’s too cold and windy outside, or too slippery.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2020/jun/11/babushka-svetlana-and-me-a-photo-essay">Continue reading...</a>
