A cover of Always Something There to Remind Me by Pomplamoose.
Original song written by Burt Bacharach and David Hal, and performed by Dionne Warwick (but I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it in the comments! I thought it was a Naked Eyes tune...very glad to know the actual original now!)
