Correction: it took Sarah Cain 40 minutes to get to work \u2013 until the day we speak, when it took 16 minutes. Because Cain, who previously walked to work, has got herself a bike. \u201cIt was a bit nerve-racking,\u201d she tells me on the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve been on a bicycle.\u201d</p><p>But she set off early, the weather was fine and she knows the route. \u201cI had my helmet on and a bright jacket,\u201d she says. \u201cI might be a bit shaky in more traffic. You see a lot more families out on bikes and that gets your confidence up a little bit.\u201d She is determined to carry on: she knows it is good for her and good for Bristol. \u201cI\u2019m not going to be in the Lycra brigade, I\u2019m just going to be your bog-standard cyclist.\u201d</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/we-sold-eight-bikes-in-20-minutes-will-the-cycling-boom-last\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/we-sold-eight-bikes-in-20-minutes-will-the-cycling-boom-last", "date_published": "2020-06-09 05:00:41+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "How Hong Kong caught fire: the story of a radical uprising", "description": "<p>Hong Kong used to be seen as cautious, pragmatic and materialistic.

By Tania Branigan and Lily Kuo<strong><br /></strong></p><p>On 4 June 2020, as darkness enveloped Hong Kong, thousands of people broke through barricades and slipped into the tree-lined Victoria Park in the heart of the city. Shielding their candles from the wind, and carefully sitting 1 metre apart, they filled the length of the open space. The annual Tiananmen Square vigil had been banned, with police citing coronavirus concerns. But Hong Kong was determined to mark the anniversary as it always has. For three decades, the city has been the only place within China where the massacre can be publicly remembered. The commemoration is by far the world\u2019s largest, but also its most vulnerable. Its tiny flames speak to the endurance of hope and memory, and to their looming extinction.</p><p>When the People\u2019s Liberation Army massacred hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing on 4 June 1989, the response in Hong Kong was overwhelming. One million or more residents marched in mourning.
