Destiny 2 is coming to next-gen consoles with a free upgrade, there's more evidence for a cheaper Xbox Series X model, and Sony and Naughty Dog launch a podcast about The Last of Us. 

Destiny 2 will launch on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X as a free upgrade, meaning that players won't have to pay to make the transition to next-generation consoles. 

Some rumors have been floating around about another, cheaper version of the Xbox Series X called Project Lockhart, and now there’s even more evidence. And in the ever-growing list of new podcasts, Sony and Naughty Dog have launched one covering The Last of Us. 

For the next five weeks, GameSpot is hosting Play For All, a summer gaming celebration and charity event featuring special guests like Troy Baker, Danny O'Dwyer, and many familiar GameSpot faces. We are all coming together to raise money for Direct Relief in support of those fighting on the frontlines against COVID-19, as well as Black Lives Matter.

It's impossible to talk about Troy without bringing up both the giant wooden horse and the mythical beasts that are synonymous with Homer's Iliad. 

In Total War Saga: Troy, the developers at Creative Assembly aim to delve into the possible truths behind the myths and legends. Exploring what could be realistic interpretations of things like the Minotaur, Medusa or Centaurs while also remaining historically accurate. 

Total War Saga: Troy is releasing as an Epic Games Store exclusive for the first 12 months and will be completely free for anyone who claims the offer on the release date of August 13, 2020.

“Eyes up, Guardian”. A phrase first uttered in 2014 has become a rallying cry to all protectors of the Light. A Son, a King, a Conqueror, an Emperor, a God. No matter the challenge, Guardians rose up and overcame every odd. Now we must venture Beyond. The past is prologue.

Bungie's latest Destiny 2 stream was packed with announcements of new content. A new expansion called Beyond Light is launching this fall, a new season of events has begun, and next-gen versions of the game have been confirmed. Tony details all of this in the video above.

Beyond Light takes the Guardians to Europa, a frozen moon of Jupiter. They'll face the evil Fallen empress Eramis there. The expansion also adds a new damage type, the darkness-infused Stasis. Beyond Light launches on September 22 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and pre-orders are live now.

Destiny 2's Season of Arrivals is also about to, well, arrive as of the time of this video. It kicks off with the appearance of a Pyramid ship on Io. There's a new public event at the landing site, as well as a new dungeon called Prophecy to explore. Prophecy will open at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET today, June 9.

Lastly, Destiny 2 will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X with free upgrades. While the game will remain free-to-play, any content you purchased on PS4 will transfer to the PS5 version of the game, and the same is true to Xbox One and Series X. Intergenerational cross-play will also be available, letting PS4 and PS5 players squad up--ditto for those of you on Xbox One and Series X. Bungie is also looking into true cross-play across all consoles, but don't expect that anytime this year.

A new power is born out of the ancient Pyramid ship above Europa's frozen frontier, and a dark empire has risen beneath, united under the banner of the Fallen Kell of Darkness, Eramis. Join your fellow Guardians and bring down the empire at any cost – even if it means wielding the Darkness itself.
As the new threat emerges, so too does a mysterious new power – Stasis. Rooted in Darkness, Guardians will wield this new elemental power alongside Arc, Solar, and Void to dominate the battlefield. Titans, Warlocks, and Hunters each use Stasis in a different way, from slowing down foes with Stasis fields to encasing and shattering enemies with destructive might.

Sony's PlayStation 5 games event gets a new date, and it's coming this week. The CEO of PlayStation, Jim Ryan, stated last week was "no time to celebrate." EA's announced its first cross-play game: Need For Speed Heat. The feature will be added in an update on June 9. Twitch content creators are being hit with copyright claims on their past clips. Twitch is recommending the creators remove the clips immediately.

For the next six weeks, GameSpot is hosting Play For All, a summer gaming celebration and charity event featuring special guests like Troy Baker, Danny O'Dwyer, and many familiar GameSpot faces. We are all coming together to raise money for Direct Relief in support of those fighting on the frontlines against COVID-19, as well as Black Lives Matter.
