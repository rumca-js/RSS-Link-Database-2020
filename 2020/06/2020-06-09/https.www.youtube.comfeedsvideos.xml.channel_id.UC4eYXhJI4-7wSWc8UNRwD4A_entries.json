Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nSidney Madden | June 10, 2020\n\nNestled in her cozy, clean bedroom of mostly white accents, Baby Rose stands out with an all-black outfit, her full, billowing waves and that voice. That voice! The depths of sorrow and passion the D.C. native digs into with such conviction has come to be reliably awe-inspiring. It's the reason her Tiny Desk concert earlier this year stopped us in our tracks. And it's the reason we've invited her back to bring the heat once again, albeit from a safe and secure distance.\n\nRose's message of \"staying safe\" during her Tiny Desk (home) concert has become a commonplace cordial greeting during the coronavirus pandemic. (It's partially the reason her pianist, Timothy Maxey, is giving her room even in these close confines.) But with the added context of so many protesting police brutality and racism by taking to the streets in the last few weeks, the words feel even heavier. Coming from Rose, it's not for the sake of nicety.\n\nEarnest intention is the reason Baby Rose's music has found a place on HBO's hit series Insecure. In this bedroom mini-show, Rose performs \"Show You\" (which was used to underscore this season's most dramatic romantic plot twist), \"Pressure\" and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 \"Marmot,\" a new song premiered exclusively with NPR Music.\n\nBaby Rose proves here she doesn't need bells and whistles to capture the intensity of a moment \u2014 just raw, real vulnerability.\n\nSET LIST\n* \"Pressure\"\n* \"Marmot\" (Premiere)\n* \"Show You\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nBaby Rose: vocals; Timothy Maxey: keys\n\nCREDITS\nVideographer: Baby Rose; Audio Engineer: Baby Rose; Producers: Bobby Carter, Sidney Madden; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producers: Morgan Noelle Smith, Maia Stern; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdD3UsAemq0", "date_published": "2020-06-10 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC4eYXhJI4-7wSWc8UNRwD4A", "title": "Meet The 2020 Tiny Desk Contest Community", "description": "We got to meet so many great musicians through the 2020 Tiny Desk Contest.
