An idealist looking to make a difference in the world. You\u2018ve got more ambitious goals of ruling with an iron fist as a dictator or maybe you\u2019re just a powerful businessman looking to protect your interests and investments from the frenzy of the masses. Around the 18th and 19th century, something happened that would change the course of history and your role as a politician forever.\n\nAll of a sudden, humanity shifted from power to the state, to power to the people. Rare breeds that understand Crowd Psychology and Mob Mentality win the hearts and minds of the masses. If you want all that power, you better know how to manage crowds.\n\nA psychological crowd is when people are joined together by an idea, a cause, or beliefs. Crowds can be centered around their race, religion, political beliefs, their profession, music tastes, or simply by people identifying as a citizen of the country they\u2019re in. And the moment you join a crowd, you act and think very differently to when you\u2019re alone.\n\nCrowds are rather slow by design because they desperately need a master to guide them - this is where you come in. Just like how people crave to be in crowds, they crave having a charismatic leader to follow through the ends of the Earth. But be warned, just as easily as you can rile up a crowd towards your enemies, another leader can just as easily direct their anger towards you. Whatever kind of crowd it is, the primary job of a leader is to arouse faith in your subjects. Give people something to believe in! With some more caveats. \n\nIf you really want to change the mind of a crowd, to really change their beliefs - to get them to believe that \u201cdiamonds are valuable\u201d. And boom - you now know how crowds work, you know about our primitive desire to join crowds or tribes, you know how to avoid the destruction of crowds by not building up any envy with them, and you know how to be that charismatic leader they so desperately crave by boiling down an idea to inspire faith in them, and you know how to inculcate new beliefs in a crowd through repeating an affirmation until it becomes truth and goes viral. Now you can get out there, and start your rule or protect your business interests to make more money.\n-----------------------\n\nAll materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
