<p>Education should have been a top lockdown priority. But three months in, there is still no credible plan <br /></p><p>The government has admitted that it cannot deliver what had been promised: England’s 17,000 primary schools will not, after all, be inviting all their pupils back before the summer. In a way, it’s a relief to have it out in the open. With just 25% of reception, year 1 and year 6 children <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/09/school-reopening-plans-in-tatters-as-only-25-of-pupils-in-england-return" title="">back in classrooms last week</a>, it was obvious that the plan promoted by ministers for months was detached from reality. But this does not in any way soften the blow to their credibility. Ever since March’s delayed lockdown, planning for the pandemic’s impact on children has been poor. There is so sign whatever that the position has improved.</p><p>In a statement on Tuesday, Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, tried to insist that normality would resume in September instead. All that has been lost, in other words, is a few more weeks. If that were true, or even likely, ministers would still have an enormous amount of explaining to do. By then, the vast majority of England’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/schools-pupils-and-their-characteristics-january-2019" title="">8.8 million school-age children</a> will not have spent a day in a classroom, or with a teacher, for almost six months. A plan to roll out the technology needed by pupils to access remote learning has been subject to the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/07/were-still-waiting-schools-still-lack-free-laptops-pledged-to-help-poorer-gcse-pupils" title="">kinds of delay</a> and obfuscation that have characterised every aspect of the coronavirus response. And while ministers have announced the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/jun/05/outcry-decision-to-end-free-school-meal-voucher-scheme-in-july-legal-action-england-holiday-coronavirus" title="">withdrawal of children’s meal vouchers</a> in July, they have yet to present a plan to make up for the lost months.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/09/the-guardian-view-on-schools-ministers-have-failed-englands-children">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Much like his calling to teammates while batting, Geoffrey Boycott’s removal was later than it should have been and his survival at the BBC was to the detriment of others</p><p>The 11th and last time that Geoffrey Boycott ran out his Yorkshire teammate Richard Lumb was in the second innings of a County Championship match against Gloucestershire at Park Avenue in Bradford in 1982. It was the second time Boycott had done it to Lumb in that same match and afterwards Lumb sat in the dressing room with his pads on waiting for his partner to come back in from the middle.</p><p>When he did, Lumb, usually a quiet man, shouted: “What do you think you’re doing? Twice in the match? That’s 11-0 on run-outs now.” Boycott apologised. “I must be bad at it, what should I do?” he said. “You should piss off,” Lumb told him, “like you should have done 10 years ago.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/09/farewell-geoffrey-boycott-a-mess-of-contradictions-whose-tms-innings-lasted-far-too-long">Continue reading...</a>

Or at a push 1.5 metres. But after months of finding their work being corrupted by the government to suit its own ends, the scientists dug their heels in. The social-distancing requirement would still be set at 2 metres.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jun/09/williamson-can-hardly-fiddle-the-science-when-he-cant-count-to-two">Continue reading...</a>

<p><strong>Wigmore Hall/BBC Radio 3</strong><br />Both violin and piano showed a vast range of colours and textures in this lunchtime recital that included Franck and a memorable Schumann encore</p><p>There is a point in the high-energy third movement (Dryads and Pan) of Szymanowski’s Mythes Op 30 for violin and piano when there’s a sudden change of gear: the piece’s manic prancing temporarily abates and the violinist plays alone, using only harmonics. It’s one of the strangest, most haunting sounds a string instrument can make. That passage and the re-entry of the piano that follows were one of several spine-tingling moments in violinist Hyeyoon Park’s Wigmore Hall lunchtime recital with her partner and regular collaborator, pianist <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/30/grosvenor-park-ridout-soltani-bosch-review-thrilling-trout-quintet-revival">Benjamin Grosvenor</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>No empty hall could sound more still than it did as Park and Grosvenor spun Szymanowski’s gossamer musical fabric in that third movement. Such impressionistic music depends hugely on the quality of its surface and in this performance it was practically flawless. Grosvenor’s touch was astonishingly responsive – as supple in quiet, single-handed lyricism as in flurries of quicksilver virtuosity – while Park made stylish use throughout of portamento and her irrepressibly expressive vibrato.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/09/hyeyoon-park-benjamin-grosvenor-review-wigmore-hall-bbc-radio-3">Continue reading...</a>

## Boris Johnson's US trade deal will make Britain a paradise for disaster capitalists | George Monbiot

<p>Chlorinated chicken is just the start. The government intends to rip up food standards, public services and public protections</p><p>The Conservative manifesto made a clear promise. It <a href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5da42e2cae7ebd3f8bde353c/5dda924905da587992a064ba_Conservative%202019%20Manifesto.pdf">pledged</a> that in the government’s trade talks, “we will not compromise on our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food standards”. Just six months after the election, the promise has been ditched. Our government is now <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/06/03/britain-ready-allow-import-chlorinated-chicken-us/">proposing</a> that chlorine-washed chicken, beef treated with growth hormones, pork from animals injected with a drug that makes their meat leaner, called <a href="https://www.livescience.com/47032-time-for-us-to-ban-ractopamine.html">ractopamine</a>, and scores of other foods produced in the United States by dangerous, cruel and disgusting means will be allowed into this country, as long as higher trade taxes (tariffs) are applied to them.</p><p>&nbsp;The trade secretary, Liz Truss, has made it clear that any such tariffs would be <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/chlorinated-chicken-us-trade-talks-boris-johnson-trump-a9549656.html">removed within 10 years</a>. It’s impossible to see the American trade negotiators allowing them to pass in the first place. The US intends to secure “comprehensive” access to our food markets, while “<a href="https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Summary_of_U.S.-UK_Negotiating_Objectives.pdf">reducing or eliminating tariffs</a>”. This nonsense about higher tariffs is a blatant attempt to soften us up, to sugar the toxic pill of US imports that don’t meet our standards.

We have to be magnificently careful about any stereotypes we create.”</p><p>Theatre, he thinks, has been complicit in turning the “problematic black male” into an archetype. “I challenge people to look at plays of the last 20 years that deal with black and brown people where the black male is not by default a deficient lover, father or partner.” This stereotype has been used against the black community, he says, citing the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher">recent case of Amy Cooper, the white woman</a> from New York who reported a black man in Central Park for allegedly threatening her, although it was clear from filmed footage that this was not the case. “There was Amy Cooper weaponising whiteness and femininity to take down a black male.

## Bonnie Pointer: from country to disco, this Sister did it for herself

<p>As one of the original Pointer Sisters, Bonnie Pointer, who has died aged 69, brilliantly wrongfooted her audience by hopping from blaxploitation films to Nashville</p><p>There were effectively two different versions of the Pointer Sisters. There was the 80s hit machine, a trio whose sound existed somewhere between soul and shiny synth-pop, authors of the ubiquitous I’m So Excited and Jump (For My Love). And there was the Pointer Sisters that existed before them, when Bonnie Pointer was still a member, who were a very different and far more intriguing proposition: a quartet, dressed in a chaotic, charity-shop approximation of 1940s glamour, whose sound zigzagged wittily and unpredictably between jazz, soul, blues and country.</p><p>They could make music that matched their outfits, sounding like an African-American equivalent of the Manhattan Transfer, or of Bette Midler belting out The Lullaby of Broadway and Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy to the delight of the patrons of New York’s Continental Baths. Alternatively, they could turn out a tough take on Willie Dixon’s Wang Dang Doodle or the humid New Orleans funk of Allen Toussaint’s Yes We Can Can. They could do disco, as on 1977’s Waiting on You; equally, they could win a Grammy for the best country performance by a duo or group, as they did for Fairytale (1974). </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/09/bonnie-pointer-country-to-disco-pointer-sisters">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Our relationship is perfect, apart from the sex. I want him to be comfortable with me and I have tried everything to make it work<br /></p><p><strong>My boyfriend and I have known each other for almost </strong><strong>two years</strong><strong> and have been dating for </strong><strong>eight months. Our relationship is </strong><strong>perfect, except </strong><strong>for one thing</strong><strong>: our sex life. He can only </strong><strong>climax through masturbation. </strong><strong>I have tried everything. </strong><strong>I have asked him what he likes or if he wants us to watch porn together, but he </strong><strong>won’t tell me what kind of porn he likes because he says it is embarrassing </strong><strong>- </strong><strong>it is </strong><strong>a taboo subject </strong><strong>for him. </strong><strong>We</strong><strong> have had sex </strong><strong>about 10 times in the </strong><strong>eight months we</strong><strong> have been together. He doesn’t </strong><strong>give oral sex and </strong><strong>has never made me </strong><strong>climax, either. </strong><strong>We have had sex last for an hour – and still nothing. He told me it was</strong><strong> because he </strong><strong>masturbated too much, then</strong><strong> he</strong><strong> said </strong><strong>the reason was </strong><strong>that he had been sexually abused when he was younger</strong><strong>, then a month later he said it was </strong><strong>the result of a low sex drive. </strong><strong>I don’t know if </strong><strong>he is just not attracted to me, even though he says he is</strong><strong>. I also had a discussion with him about </strong><strong>whether he was gay, </strong><strong>but he</strong><strong> swore </strong><strong>he wasn’t. </strong><strong>He is my best friend and I </strong><strong>want to make it work. I want him to be comfortable with me and I want to help him let go of all </strong><strong>the bad stuff that has happened to him</strong><strong> so he can </strong><strong>be happy, </strong><strong>with or without me.</strong></p><p>Back off. Stop trying to “fix” him. You obviously care about him a lot – and I understand your frustration and your desire to help him enjoy sex and be able to climax with you – but&nbsp;he does not need the pressure you are putting on him. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/jun/09/adult-survivors-childhood-sex-abuse-come-forward">Survivors of childhood sexual abuse</a> often struggle with adult relationships. Tragically, their future sexuality is frequently designed by their abusers and it takes a long process of healing to move beyond it. Being unable to complete or even enjoy sex is common among survivors. Shame is often part of the legacy of abuse and may explain why your boyfriend is minimising his problem as the result of excessive masturbating or a low libido. Accusing him of being gay, pushing him to watch porn or prolonging attempts to make him climax will all be experienced by him as cruel and torturous – and may even re-traumatise him. Stop. This is not about you and nothing you can do will help, except being kind, loving and supportive – and gently encouraging him to seek the proper healing he needs and deserves.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/09/my-boyfriend-was-abused-as-a-child-how-can-i-help-him-and-our-sex-life">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Hong Kong used to be seen as cautious, pragmatic and materialistic. But in the past year, an increasingly bold protest movement has transformed the city. Now, as Beijing tightens its grip, how much longer can the movement survive? By Tania Branigan and Lily Kuo<strong><br /></strong></p><p>On 4 June 2020, as darkness enveloped Hong Kong, thousands of people broke through barricades and slipped into the tree-lined Victoria Park in the heart of the city. Shielding their candles from the wind, and carefully sitting 1 metre apart, they filled the length of the open space. The annual Tiananmen Square vigil had been banned, with police citing coronavirus concerns. But Hong Kong was determined to mark the anniversary as it always has. For three decades, the city has been the only place within China where the massacre can be publicly remembered. The commemoration is by far the world’s largest, but also its most vulnerable. Its tiny flames speak to the endurance of hope and memory, and to their looming extinction.</p><p>When the People’s Liberation Army massacred hundreds of demonstrators in Beijing on 4 June 1989, the response in Hong Kong was overwhelming. One million or more residents marched in mourning. People from across society – clergymen, activists, Cantopop stars, businesspeople, foreign diplomats, even triad gangs – worked together to smuggle “most wanted” student leaders off the mainland and to safety.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/how-hong-kong-caught-fire-radical-uprising-protest-china">Continue reading...</a>
