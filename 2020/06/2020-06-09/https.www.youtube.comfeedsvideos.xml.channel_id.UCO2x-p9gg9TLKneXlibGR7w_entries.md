Fiber internet is the new cool thing in the tech world, but it can get confusing because from country-to-country (even company-to-company), definitions vary. On this episode of Snazzy Labs, we install fiber internet and explain what FTTX means, the difference between AON and PON optical networks, and why Active Ethernet is going to be an awesome solution for us. How to get faster internet? How to get lower ping time? This is how. Gigabit speeds and sub-1ms ping time to the rescue!
