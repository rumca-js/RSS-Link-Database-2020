A new expansion called Beyond Light is launching this fall, a new season of events has begun, and next-gen versions of the game have been confirmed. Tony details all of this in the video above.\n\nBeyond Light takes the Guardians to Europa, a frozen moon of Jupiter. They'll face the evil Fallen empress Eramis there. The expansion also adds a new damage type, the darkness-infused Stasis. Beyond Light launches on September 22 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and pre-orders are live now.\n\nDestiny 2's Season of Arrivals is also about to, well, arrive as of the time of this video. It kicks off with the appearance of a Pyramid ship on Io. There's a new public event at the landing site, as well as a new dungeon called Prophecy to explore. Prophecy will open at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET today, June 9.\n\nLastly, Destiny 2 will be coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X with free upgrades. While the game will remain free-to-play, any content you purchased on PS4 will transfer to the PS5 version of the game, and the same is true to Xbox One and Series X. Intergenerational cross-play will also be available, letting PS4 and PS5 players squad up--ditto for those of you on Xbox One and Series X. Bungie is also looking into true cross-play across all consoles, but don't expect that anytime this year.", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtip6A4DwLo", "date_published": "2020-06-09 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}, {"source": "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCbu2SsF-Or3Rsn3NxqODImw", "title": "Destiny 2: Beyond Light \u2013 Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer", "description": "A new power is born out of the ancient Pyramid ship above Europa's frozen frontier, and a dark empire has risen beneath, united under the banner of the Fallen Kell of Darkness, Eramis.
