I was wondering: is there a way I can record my two webcams and the a6000 at the same time, so I can mix the three camera feeds as a multicam clip later?\n\nContents:\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:34 - Record via external cameras\n01:01 - Multiple cams in one stream\n01:36 - OBS hack for multiple cams\n01:59 - CaptureSync\n02:10 - Record with QuickTime\n02:33 - Record two cams with QuickTime\n04:08 - Record three cams with QuickTime\n04:48 - Outtro\n\nI know I can do it during a stream in OBS or similar streaming software, but that doesn't preserve the original source footage, so I can't re-edit the video later and choose different camera angles, or choose to do side-by-side or picture-in-picture video later.\n\nWell, it turns out, you CAN do it on a Mac, by creating multiple copies of QuickTime Player!
