## Billy Kee: 'If I didn’t opt out of football, I don’t know if I would be alive'

<p>The former Accrington striker is building a future as a bricklayer after struggling with the demands of being a pro footballer</p><p>“We ran out of bricks and compo today, so the rest is getting delivered tomorrow,” Billy Kee says, instinctively slipping into industry jargon. He has not long got through the door at home in Leicestershire after an unusually early finish on the building site where for the past six months he has been working as a labourer and apprentice bricklayer.</p><p>Since retiring from professional football aged 29 because of struggles with bulimia, anxiety and depression, Kee has traded clocking off at midday for marathon days and mortar mixes. It has been a rocky road since his last appearance for Accrington Stanley in the penultimate game of last season, a 5-1 home win against Plymouth that guaranteed the club’s League One status in which he opened the scoring from the penalty spot. The final day brought a trip to Portsmouth but he did not play, despite travelling.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/08/billy-kee-interview-accrington-stanley-burton-footballer-bricklayer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Force of history demands re-evaluation of colonial statues and street names </p><p>Cities have always been about apportioning and memorialising power; about writing force into space. Britain’s colonial and imperial past is inscribed into the bricks and mortar of every city and town in the country. Mostly this hidden text of power relations and wealth acquisition lies dormant in the half-forgotten significance of street names, in the knotty iconography of grand facades, in the barely read inscriptions on memorials and sculptures, in the nomenclature of grand public buildings. Forming the backdrop of lived lives, these omnipresent clues are rarely fully decoded. The most monumental of sculptures has a habit of fading away to near invisibility if it is sufficiently familiar.</p><p>At times, though, such associations are activated and become urgent. So it has been in the case of the long-running affair of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/jun/08/who-was-edward-colston-and-why-was-his-bristol-statue-toppled-slave-trader-black-lives-matter-protests">Edward Colston</a>, who made his fortune in the 17th century from the enslavement of thousands of Africans.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/britains-urban-fabric-comes-under-spotlight-shone-by-blm-protests">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Readers respond to the toppling of a monument of slave-trader Edward Colston in Bristol, during anti-racism protests over the weekend</p><p>Objects are neither value-free nor immutable. They bear meanings and have life histories. In 1895, the Bristol elite attended the unveiling of a statue to the 17th-century slave-trader Edward Colston. It was the heyday of empire. In 2020, to cheers of joy from the crowd, Bristol’s Black Lives Matter protesters pulled down the statue and desecrated the fallen idol. They “ritually killed” it, as we say in archaeology.</p><p>An object’s rite of passage, as it moves from one phase of its existence to the next, is often marked by elaborate performance art. The idol was kicked and bashed. Knees were placed on its neck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/the-fall-of-a-statue-and-victory-for-the-oppressed">Continue reading...</a>

<p>‘We stomped into EMI and told them we were going to be the biggest band in the world’</p><p>I was taking piano and clarinet lessons at school when I saw the Clash at Brighton Centre on the Combat Rock tour.

Brewer who enhanced the fortunes of the St Austell Brewery in Cornwall, where he worked for more than 20 years<p>Roger Ryman was a brewer who stood out from the crowd.

Roger, who has died aged 52 of cancer, spent more than 20 years at the Cornish brewery.</p><p>His predecessor once said beer sales “fell off the cliff” at the end of the summer when visitors left Cornwall.

Like the present pandemic, a psychedelic drug experiences can be transformative – of the individual – and of society. Both illuminate the extent to which the condition of the world we inhabit is dependent on our own behaviours.

<p>A simple stovetop almost-risotto of rice and mussels from the heel of Italy</p><p>Pulling beards from mussels is one of the most satisfying cooking tasks. Especially when you have preoccupations tugging at your attention. In fact, maybe “tugging” is a better word to describe the mussel task; tugging the wispy beard that pokes out of the shell – like a coat stuck in a car door – the bundle of threads created by mussels in order to attach to a solid surface, a rock, a quayside, pier-leg.</p><p>As a child, I remember being terrified by the clusters of mussels clinging like wild necklaces to the legs of the pier in Brittany. I would choose to swim 100m back through ink and shadows, alone, rather than climbing up and over the black-blue shells with the others. I also remember eating mussels on that holiday, opening the hinged shells to find an orange ear, being unsettled and delighted by the texture and pool of liquor, by the woman on the next table who got “a bad one” and was sick into her bag, neatly, which I thought was impressive. Even more impressive was how she left, came back to the table, dismissed any concern, and had a glass of champagne.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/08/rachel-roddy-recipe-puglian-rice-and-mussels">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the first two series of the HBO smash about a warring, super-rich brood returns to UK screens, here’s a rundown of the show’s greatest, most horrendous scenes</p><p>Succession manages to combine the two key quarantine trends of 2020: insanely rich people acting in their own horrible self-interest, and really nice houses that you wish were yours. As such, it has been nothing short of a tragedy that we haven’t been able to watch the show in the UK while under lockdown, since it fell off the streaming services some time after season two aired.</p><p>However, miracle of miracles, this error has now been rectified. As of today, both seasons of Succession – our Fleabag and Chernobyl-beating <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/02/50-best-tv-shows-2019">best show of last year</a>, remember – are available to view again. If you haven’t seen it, you should close this page now and steam through every episode as a matter of urgency as there are <em><strong>spoilers ahead</strong></em>. But if you have, let me whet your appetite for a rewatch with a list of Succession’s best moments.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/08/succession-10-best-moments">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As catwalks go digital for who-knows-how-long, our fashion critic looks back on two decades of attending fashion weeks </p><p>Fashion people love to exaggerate, but I have been to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2018/feb/15/the-view-from-the-front-row-a-history-of-the-fashion-show-photo-essay">a lot of fashion shows</a> – about 3,000, by according to my back-of-envelope maths. Mostly in London, Paris, Milan and New York, but also Tokyo and Rio de Janeiro, Berlin and Edinburgh, Marrakech and Reykjavik. Twenty years of pret-a-porter and haute-couture collections – two of each every year, give or take two maternity leave gaps, a bout of appendicitis and the time I messed up my US visa – adds up to a lot of catwalk time.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2020/jun/08/fashion-shows-weeks-catwalk-runways-digital">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The musician, who cheated death a few years back, looks forward to the end of his strict isolation at home in Southend</p><p>The message from the NHS told me that my age and underlying conditions made me especially vulnerable to Covid-19 – infection would result in very serious illness. I was to go into complete isolation for 12 weeks, not even allowed to step outside my front door. There followed a period of living in a science-fiction film – arranging deliveries with people in masks and gloves, phone calls to remote stranded friends, who all said it was weird – and then everything settled into this endless day.</p><p>In 2012 I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told I had less than a year to live. The tumour was not amenable to surgery, and chemotherapy, with all its attendant suffering, could do no more than slow it down. I decided to accept death as a certainty, seek no miracle cures or second opinions, and spend my money. To wake every morning to that hopeless reality; to walk in crowded streets like a ghost, pitying the mortals around you; and still to have that steady knowledge in your solar plexus that your future is a universal blank. It was an extraordinary year.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/08/wilko-johnson-musician-on-life-in-lockdown-i-feel-grateful-to-be-alive">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The effects of global heating are in evidence everywhere across the islands of Antarctica – from penguin colonies to melting glaciers. The Guardian’s global environment editor Jonathan Watts witnessed how conditions are changing quickly</p><p>When you stand on the wild terrain of St George’s Island in Antarctica, many of the world’s problems can feel very far away. For example, Antarctica is the only continent not to have a single case of coronavirus. But it is vulnerable to the other great global crisis: the climate emergency.</p><p>Earlier this year the Guardian’s global environment editor, <strong>Jonathan Watts, </strong>joined a scientific voyage to Antarctica, a journey taking in research on penguin colonies, glaciers and sealife. He tells <strong>Anushka Asthana </strong>that what he witnessed was both awe-inspiring and terrifying. The speed at which the climate crisis is moving is all too evident, and avoiding its worst consequences will need global cooperation on a larger scale than that working to good effect currently on the continent. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/08/the-sounds-of-melting-icebergs-and-whale-songs-a-journey-into-antarctica">Continue reading...</a>
