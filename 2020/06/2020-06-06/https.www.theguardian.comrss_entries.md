<p>The influential French thinker explains the politics of the Gaia principle, the problems of post-truth and how coronavirus gives us a model for spreading ideas</p><p>In the early days of the lockdown, philosopher <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/feb/04/bruno-latour-moving-earths-theatre-science-climate-crisis">Bruno Latour</a> wrote an essay for the <em><a href="https://aoc.media/">AOC</a></em> cultural online newspaper. “The first lesson the coronavirus has taught us,” <a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/downloads/P-202-AOC-ENGLISH_1.pdf">he wrote</a>, “is also the most astounding: we have actually proven that it is possible, in a few weeks, to put an economic system on hold everywhere in the world…” That essay, translated since into <a href="http://www.bruno-latour.fr/node/852.html">at least 12 languages</a>, has encouraged many to reimagine how different the world could look if we learned from this experience. It has also solidified the reputation of the Paris Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po)&nbsp;emeritus professor as one of the most influential thinkers of our age. </p><p><strong>How has the pandemic reshaped our societies?<br /></strong>Some say this is the revenge of nature.

## GoGo Penguin: GoGo Penguin review – adrenaline rush

<p>(Blue Note)</p><p>At times on this fourth album from the Manchester trio you want to ask: “What’s the rush?” A pell-mell, pedal-to-the-floor approach is, of course, one of the group’s signatures. They may owe a debt to the repetitive minimalism of composers like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/philip-glass">Philip Glass</a>, but they grew up in the era of techno and drum and bass, and have cannily adapted the rush of electronic music to a traditional acoustic lineup of piano, double bass and drums.</p><p>Now in&nbsp;their mid-30s, they are on crisp, confident form here, having taken time to refine their approach: every thrum and drone of Nick Blacka’s bass on a track like <a href="https://gogopenguin.lnk.to/GoGoPenguin">Atomised</a> is chosen precisely, every swirl of Chris Illingworth’s remarkable piano is more considered than the often breakneck pace suggests. Nonetheless, the dynamic of the tracks is too often similar – go fast, slow down, go even faster – and the record often shines brightest at its least hurried. The three minutes of Embers offers a reflective lyricism, as does the closing Don’t Go, where Blacka’s bass is forefront.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/06/gogo-penguin-gogo-penguin-review-adrenaline-rush">Continue reading...</a>

The marches and protests that have swept the major cities in recent days have not only been about George Floyd, the unarmed black man who died at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis on the Monday before last – or, more precisely, his left knee, when it was applied with remorseless force to the side of Floyd’s neck during an arrest.</p><p>This is not only about police brutality in the United States, however appalling that is, however grotesque the death toll, and it is not something that is just happening over there. This is about something on our shores and, indeed, everywhere else, deeply pernicious and to listen to Gray, the Watford striker who is preparing for a return to Premier League action the week after next, is to listen to a man trying to process a range of emotions, all of them uncomfortable.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/jun/06/watford-andre-gray-george-floyd-stereotyped-and-judged-by-police">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Woody Allen’s romantic comedy starring Elle Fanning is the work of a director who has lost touch with reality</p><p>In Woody Allen’s latest offering, Gen Z heart-throb Timothée Chalamet plays a character named Gatsby Welles. This is only the film’s first red flag. Though <em>A Rainy Day in New York</em> is set in present-day Manhattan, college student Welles is not a modern man. He loves “a cocktail lounge piano” and prefers vintage cigarette holders to the vape pens held by his peers. Ever the gentleman, he volunteers as tour guide to his prim pageant queen girlfriend Ashleigh (Elle Fanning), who is in town to interview middle-aged film director Roland Pollard (Liev Schreiber) for their school paper. She ditches Gatsby for a more mature set of chaperones, including a screenwriter (Jude Law) and a Hollywood actor (Diego Luna), who she charms with her naivety and adorable tics, such as a tendency to hiccup when “sexually conflicted”.&nbsp;Cut to a&nbsp;leering “comedy” set piece as&nbsp;Fanning&nbsp;is&nbsp;locked out of Luna’s apartment in her bra and pants.&nbsp;Characters and storylines appear to have been chosen at random by a Woody Allen meme generator.&nbsp;</p><p>The film’s B-plot involves Chalamet avoiding his mother, and reconnecting with an ex’s sparky younger sister&nbsp;(Selena Gomez).&nbsp;Gomez’s smoky, sardonic delivery is wonderful. The same cannot be said for Chalamet, who spends the film shrugging his shoulders, his head shrinking into his neck like an affected, embarrassed turtle.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/06/a-rainy-day-in-new-york-review-misogyny-bathed-in-nostalgia">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Interscope)</p><p>After a po-faced stab at country, Lady Gaga returns to the land of make-believe on a vivid new album that excites and heals</p><p>What a relief: the “real” Lady Gaga is gone. For a while, it looked like pop’s high priestess of serious silliness was being sucked into the Slough of Authenticity – first with her supposedly stripped-back, country-inspired 2016 album <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/23/lady-gaga-joanne-album-review-a-yo-million-reasons">Joanne</a></em> (in truth, about as stripped back as Universal Studios is when compared with Disney World), then with her garlanded turn in <em>A Star Is Born</em> and its painfully earnest soundtrack album.&nbsp;</p><p>Being real is a look every artist has to try on at least once, but it was never going to become Gaga’s signature style. <em>Chromatica</em>, her sixth album, brings back the spectacle, manifesting a parallel reality she’s had one foot in since childhood, centred on colour, kindness and connection. “Earth is cancelled,” she declared. “I live on Chromatica.” Coronavirus temporarily put a halt to the world-building begun in the <em>Star Trek</em>-flavoured video for lead single Stupid Love, forcing her to delay the album (she curated the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/20/one-world-together-at-home-concert-lady-gaga-raises-127m-coronavirus-relief">One World: Together </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/20/one-world-together-at-home-concert-lady-gaga-raises-127m-coronavirus-relief">at Home</a> concerts in the meantime) and leaving her summer tour up in the air.

<p>The actor and writer, 32, talks about growing up around women, winning Baftas, finding her mantra and surviving sexual assault</p><p><strong>In 2016, I was the</strong> victim of a sexual assault. It inspired my new series, <em>I May Destroy You</em>. After speaking to women and men who’d suffered similar attacks, I realised my experience was incrediblycommon. That made me create a show exploring the line between consent and rape.</p><p><strong>It wasn’t a painful </strong>role to play. Playing a character means you can go to dark places and none of it’s real. Writing it was the hard part, but even that pain was juxtaposed with euphoria. If I’m here to reflect on it, it means I’ve survived it. That’s a miracle to sit alongside the pain.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/06/michaela-coel-the-secret-to-relationships-is-tbeing-happy-by-yourself">Continue reading...</a>

## George Floyd: reporting on a week of fury, pain and deep solidarity

<p>Guardian reporters in the US and around the world reflect on a week of profound unrest – and, possibly, change</p><p>This has been by far the most serious unrest I’ve covered in the US.&nbsp;<br />I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks.&nbsp;<br />Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country.&nbsp;<br /><br />For two nights in a row, the police evaporated – leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger.&nbsp;<br />That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd’s death was so clear-cut and painful. It’s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin’s kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson.&nbsp;<br /><br />But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd’s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up.<br /><br />Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand. There were times when it looked as if the local medical school was charging the police accompanied by particularly fashionable rioters in designer masks.<br /><br />In a sign of our times, reporters found themselves not only hit with baton rounds and teargas by the police when it was clear they were shooting at journalists, but facing physical threats from some among the protesters. These tended to be young men, both white and black, who see the media as part of the conspiracy.&nbsp;<br /><br />And if you look like me (ageing, no hair), there’s the occasional person who imagines you are a police spy and lets you know with varying degrees of hostility. Although this was pretty easily dealt with the moment they heard my accent.<br /></p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/jun/06/george-floyd-protest-reporting-us">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The 16-year-old’s dance clips used to embarrass big sister Dixie. A year and 60m followers later, even their parents are getting in on the act</p><p>Most modern teenagers have a discreet, thumbed-aside corner of their smartphones where they stash away the apps they are most ashamed of using. In 2018, this was where a 17-year-old US high school student called Dixie D’Amelio kept an odd little social media app called <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/tiktok" title="">TikTok</a>. From what Dixie could make of it, TikTok expected users to record and post ultra-short, ultra-energetic videos of themselves that were soundtracked with pre-made audio clips. Songs. Snatches of dialogue. Users danced to these clips or lip-synced along. They copied each other’s moves and riffed on references and in-jokes that were starting to slosh around <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/" title="">TikTok</a>’s expanding global network.</p><p>More and more, Dixie enjoyed scrolling through the endless feed of hectic TikTok videos, but in private. She was a TikTok lurker and would never have dreamed of posting anything herself because, as she puts it: “<em>Ew</em>. People at school made fun of TikTok. It was looked down on. Embarrassing!” When she found out that her younger sister Charli, a talented dancer, had started posting videos on the app, Dixie was horrified. It would surely mean social death. “I was, like, Charli, dude, what are you <em>doing</em>?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/06/its-hard-to-put-the-brakes-on-it-we-doubled-down-charli-damelio-and-the-first-family-of-tiktok">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As the fang-tastic houseshare sitcom enters its second season, its creator and stars discuss death, sex and petty grudges</p><p>When you’re cooped up at home all day, cohabiting with people who may not have complementary personalities, it’s important to keep the lines of communication open. Regular house meetings can address such simmering resentments as blood stains on the sofa, half-drunk orgy guests left cluttering up the hall or, as in the new series of sitcom <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/19/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-review-the-undead-prove-dead-funny">What We Do in the Shadows</a>, when “the house reeks of decaying flesh and there are dead birds everywhere”.</p><p>These are agenda items brought up by Nandor the Relentless, a 758-year-old vampire, former soldier of the Ottoman empire and the pernickety, self-appointed leader of this houseshare in a decaying New York mansion. Nandor (Kayvan Novak) lives with his long-suffering human “familiar” Guillermo (Harvey Guillén), aristocratic English bloodsucker Laszlo (Matt Berry), Laszlo’s fun-loving vamp wife Nadja (Natasia Demetriou) and Colin Robinson (Mark Proksch), an “energy vampire” who gains sustenance from boring his victims half to death. Now on its second series, What We Do in the Shadows is full of useful lifestyle hacks for lockdown, as Demetriou, speaking from her London home, appreciates: “What have I learned? That patience is a virtue and even if you think something’s gonna last for ever, just … I don’t know … kill people? And then it’ll go quicker?”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/06/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-bbc-two">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A trio of rice dishes from around the world: Mediterranean fried rice with anchovy lemon dressing, Greek-style red rice with feta and Persian meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce</p><p>Rice is one of my main comforts these days, not least because this special grain transports me wherever I want to go – all from the confines of my own kitchen, of course. The thing about rice is, it has a dynamic wardrobe. Yes, it’s small and unassuming, and it does subtlety really well –plain and buttered? I’ll definitely have that – but leave rice with a choice of costumes and, well, things soon get really colourful. Rice looks just as good dressed in the flavours of the Mediterranean as it does dolled up in Persian cardamom and lime. In fact, it looks good no matter what it has on, and I think it sort of knows it, too.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/06/yotam-ottolenghi-favourite-rice-recipes-fried-rice-feta-kofte-meatballs">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The government needs to introduce a points system, awarding compensation for everything from baby wrangling to noisy neighbours</p><p>My four-year-old twins went back to nursery on Monday, so lockdown ostensibly ended for them this week. Thrilling for them and, let’s be honest here, thrilling for me: I take the easing of the pandemic restrictions incredibly seriously, of course, but I’ll admit, there may have been some quiet crowing about my rediscovered freedom, albeit one in which I’m still unable to see my friends or parents. Whole <em>hours</em> when I can work – work! – without being interrupted by someone asking why Snoopy doesn’t talk, or why they aren’t allowed to drink Toilet Duck.

Although really, you’d think my friends would know by now that I’m not talking about them: it’s always all about me.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/06/who-had-it-hardest-in-lockdown-needless-competition">Continue reading...</a>

## Max Brooks: 'Pandemics come in predictable cycles. If I'm the smartest guy in the room, we're in big trouble'

<p>The World War Z author talks about how science fiction turned him into a disaster expert, Donald Trump, and growing up with parents Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft </p><p>Max Brooks is getting a little tired of being proved right. An author with cult appeal and massive sales, he is regularly referred to as “a soothsayer” and “a genius”. His 2006 novel, <em><a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/world-war-z-9780715653739.html">World War Z</a></em>, was about a deadly virus originating in China that causes global devastation, and his compulsive new one, <em>Devolution: A Firsthand Account of the Sasquatch Massacre</em>, is about people forced into self-isolation, huddling in terror from an unimaginable threat outside. But Brooks, 47, is dismissive of the hyperbole: “Everything I write about has already happened. The history of pandemics tends to come in extremely predictable cycles. So if I’m the smartest guy in the room, we’re in big trouble,” he tells me over Skype from his home in Los Angeles (our interview was in May, before the national protests after the killing of George Floyd, but well after lockdown started.). He has the jittery energy of the chronically anxious, and the easy confidence of one who has been thoroughly validated.</p><p>He certainly saw the coronavirus coming long before most politicians, and was making preparations in January. On 16 March, when most people in the western world were barely getting to grips with the lockdown, he made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40yPXcMaOw">a video</a> about the importance of social distancing to protect the elderly. He enlisted the help of the oldest person in his life, his father, comedy god, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/mel-brooks">Mel Brooks</a>. “If I get the coronavirus, I’ll probably be OK. But if I give it to him, he could give it to Carl Reiner, who can give it to Dick Van Dyke, and before I know it, I’ve wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends,” says Brooks, pointing to his father behind a glass door and listing his closest friends. The video has been watched more than 16m times. “I wasn’t given some secret information. I got my information from the news. Really deep state: turning on CNN and watching Wuhan getting locked down,” he says dryly.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/06/max-brooks-pandemics-science-fiction-world-war-z-devolution">Continue reading...</a>

When the Nepalese mountaineer saw the line of about 100 people waiting to reach the crest of Everest on 22 May last year, he knew there was no way he could overtake the slower climbers. Mentally, he abandoned the record he was attempting, for the fastest climb between the neighbouring peaks of Lhotse and Everest.</p><p>Poor weather at the start of the climbing season had meant there was only a very small window of time in which people could attempt the summit – just three clear days. In 2018, the year before, there had been 11 good days, allowing climbing companies to stagger their teams. Purja had known there would be queues, but was taken aback by the numbers.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/06/everyone-is-in-that-fine-line-between-death-and-life-inside-everests-deadliest-queue">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Questions of race have made me tired since I was old enough to understand what police brutality was – I can shine a light on the issues, but I’m no teacher or strategist</p><p>I am not a teacher.

It’s not my responsibility to redress a system that is institutionally racist. I can shine a light on it, but I already have a job. And diversity corrections strategist is not it. <em>Neither</em>&nbsp;is teacher.</p><p>My inbox is filled by two types of people at the moment: those who have read and are highlighting the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement">Black Lives Matter</a> discussions in <em>Queenie</em>, and others who are demanding that I tell them how they can do better. They want to know what to read, what to post, where they can begin to learn. And these are hard conversations to have. At the moment, all I can feel is sadness. I feel grief and sometimes I feel helpless.

But what constitutes an appropriate fragrance for time spent social distancing or confined to one’s own kitchen table?

<p>From ballet fusion to disco aerobics: there’s so much on offer, I might never leave the house again</p><p>I’ve got to know a neighbour who, when this is all over, I intend to make a friend of, for partly this reason: that she texted me, with the urgency of an air raid siren, to say that her livestreamed yoga class was full of niche-famous people, and if you pinned <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fionamillar" title="">Fiona Millar</a> as the main speaker, you could see her kitchen.

<p>As the rush of nostalgia subsides and television enters a new, more complicated era, how much should art imitate life?</p><p>On the face of it, the two early TV hits of lockdown didn’t have much in common. There was Netflix’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series">Tiger King</a>, taking us on a bizarre journey into the dark underbelly of American big cat breeding. And there was ITV’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/13/quiz-review-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-charles-ingram-diana-drama">Quiz</a>, an entertaining dramatisation of a small-screen oddity from our recent past. Perhaps all they shared was how little they had to say about our current situation. They hit a sweet spot of cultural nostalgia and detachment from reality. Both were too singular in terms of content to have much wider resonance, and, as we adjusted to a scary and unfamiliar new paradigm, that was just the ticket.</p><p>There’s an odd moment in Quiz when, at the height of what’s essentially a fantastically trivial tale about possible cheating on a TV gameshow, 9/11 happens. To anyone watching the drama as the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak">Covid-19</a> death toll mounted, this felt jarringly familiar. Here was real life, poking its nose in where it wasn’t wanted. Couldn’t we even have an hour’s worth of respite from terrifying global events? Apparently not. And this implied a question. The practical challenges presented to the television industry by the Covid-19 pandemic are self-evident. But what about the creative, emotional challenges? What kind of TV will viewers want once the cameras start rolling again?</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/06/the-country-will-need-strictly-the-future-of-post-pandemic-tv-corona-virus">Continue reading...</a>
