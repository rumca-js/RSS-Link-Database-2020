US and around the world reflect on a week of profound unrest \u2013 and, possibly, change</p><p>This has been by far the most serious unrest I\u2019ve covered in the US.&nbsp;<br />I was in Ferguson six years ago where the protests looked more dramatic on the television than they actually were, with a few buildings looted and burned, and confrontations with the police a staged nightly ritual over the same few blocks.&nbsp;<br />Minneapolis was on a different scale, both in the depth of anger and the levels of protest and destruction. Many thousands turned out to lay siege to the police station in the precinct where George Floyd was killed before they stormed and burned it. Many thousands more marched in different parts of Minneapolis and St Paul before the protests spread across the country.&nbsp;<br /><br />For two nights in a row, the police evaporated \u2013 leaving a huge area around about three miles of a main shopping thoroughfare, Lake Street, under the control of protesters, looters and arsonists. Hundreds of businesses had their windows smashed, were looted, or were burned.&nbsp;<br /><br />The scale of the demonstrations and destruction reflected the scale of the anger.&nbsp;<br />That seemed to me in part because of the video of George Floyd\u2019s death was so clear-cut and painful. It\u2019s telling that so few people have tried to justify the former police officer Derek Chauvin\u2019s kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly nine minutes as the life drains out of him, unlike the many who spoke up in support of the officer who shot Michael Brown in Ferguson.&nbsp;<br /><br />But that video also added to a sense of the frustration at yet another killing of an African American man by the police, and that so little seems to change even with the rise of Black Lives Matter. The way that Chauvin looks into the phone cameras, knowing he is being filmed, and kept his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck regardless of his pleas and cries for his mother seemed to symbolise the contempt of the police for the movement.&nbsp;<br /><br />As a result, the more peaceful demonstrations drew people who do not normally protest. I even met a few Republicans who were horrified by what they saw on the video and thought the time had come to stand up.<br /><br />Through all of this, social distancing broke down completely. Riots in different times usually meant protesters tied bandanas or T-shirts around their faces to shield their identities. In 2020 everyone had a mask readily to hand. There were times when it looked as if the local medical school was charging the police accompanied by particularly fashionable rioters in designer masks.<br /><br />In a sign of our times, reporters found themselves not only hit with baton rounds and teargas by the police when it was clear they were shooting at journalists, but facing physical threats from some among the protesters. These tended to be young men, both white and black, who see the media as part of the conspiracy.&nbsp;<br /><br />And if you look like me (ageing, no hair), there\u2019s the occasional person who imagines you are a police spy and lets you know with varying degrees of hostility. Although this was pretty easily dealt with the moment they heard my accent.<br /></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/jun/06/george-floyd-protest-reporting-us\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/jun/06/george-floyd-protest-reporting-us", "date_published": "2020-06-06 11:00:21+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "\u2018It\u2019s hard to put the brakes on it.

An author with cult appeal and massive sales, he is regularly referred to as \u201ca soothsayer\u201d and \u201ca genius\u201d. His 2006 novel, <em><a href=\"https://guardianbookshop.com/world-war-z-9780715653739.html\">World War Z</a></em>, was about a deadly virus originating in China that causes global devastation, and his compulsive new one, <em>Devolution: A Firsthand Account of the Sasquatch Massacre</em>, is about people forced into self-isolation, huddling in terror from an unimaginable threat outside. But Brooks, 47, is dismissive of the hyperbole: \u201cEverything I write about has already happened. The history of pandemics tends to come in extremely predictable cycles. So if I\u2019m the smartest guy in the room, we\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d he tells me over Skype from his home in Los Angeles (our interview was in May, before the national protests after the killing of George Floyd, but well after lockdown started.).

On 16 March, when most people in the western world were barely getting to grips with the lockdown, he made <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_40yPXcMaOw\">a video</a> about the importance of social distancing to protect the elderly. He enlisted the help of the oldest person in his life, his father, comedy god, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mel-brooks\">Mel Brooks</a>. \u201cIf I get the coronavirus, I\u2019ll probably be OK. But if I give it to him, he could give it to Carl Reiner, who can give it to Dick Van Dyke, and before I know it, I\u2019ve wiped out a whole generation of comedic legends,\u201d says Brooks, pointing to his father behind a glass door and listing his closest friends. The video has been watched more than 16m times. \u201cI wasn\u2019t given some secret information. I got my information from the news.
