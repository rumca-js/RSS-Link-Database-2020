Chapter 2, Season 3 has officially begun in Fortnite, implementing several changes--some quite noticeable and others less so. Called Splashdown, the new season is water-themed and gives Fortnite an aquatic makeover.

In the video above, Jordan Ramée details the six major changes that are a part of Fortnite Chapter 2, Season 3. The most noticeable change is the new map--Fortnite's battlefield has been completely flooded. To navigate between the landmarks, you'll primarily need to take to the air or the sea in order to get around, and it's via the latter method where you'll encounter Season 3's other major change: loot sharks. Yup, murderous loot sharks.

Like every new season, Splashdown adds a new battle pass to work through, challenges to complete, and cosmetics to unlock. Splashdown adds two new weapons too--one of which, the hunting rifle, is a beloved older weapon that's been freed from its time in the vault. All this and more are detailed in the video above.

GameSpot has officially kicked off Play For All--a celebration of all things gaming.

## Baldur's Gate 3 Is Far Bigger And Stranger Than We Thought - Larian's Swen Vincke Interview

After a short Baldur's Gate 3 demo we sat down with Larian's founder Swen Vincke to talk about the early access plans as well as the huge scope of the game.

Currently the first act of the game that is realising with the early access version is bigger than the entirety of Divinity: Original Sin 2, with more to be added to the locations, classes, spells and races as development on BG3 continues.

While multiplayer will be in the game when Baldur's Gate 3 (maybe) releases in early access in August 2020, there is not currently a Dungeon Master mode in development.

## Cyberpunk 2077 Delayed Again | Save State

On today's Save State, Persia talks about the delay of Cyberpunk 2077, the scale of Spider-Man: Miles Morales, and Sony's new trademark on the DualSense controller. 

Persia talks about the delay of Cyberpunk 2077 that was announced by the game on Twitter this morning. Cybperpunk 2077 is now set to released on November 19th, 2020. With the additional two months, CD Projekt Red will use the time to properly go through everything, balance game mechanics, and fix a lot of bugs. 

Persia also goes over new details behind Spider-Man: Miles Morales that give us a better idea of how long the game will be. Insomniac said the game will be comparable to Uncharted: The Lost legacy. This means that Spider-Man: Miles Morales will be shorter than the main story but longer than other spin-offs like Infamous: First Light. Even though the main story with Peter Parker isn't over yet, this game will be all about Miles and his journey in learning to be his own Spider-Man. 

Sony has just trademarked it's new slogan for the PS5 DualSense controller. "Heighten Your Senses" likely refers to the haptic feedback feature which will provide another level of immersion through vibrations and varying tension mechanics. This feature will make things like drawing a bow feel more realistic than ever. 

EA Play is this afternoon and we'll be streaming all of the action here on GameSpot during #PlayForAll! The stream will begin at 4PM PST. Play For All is multi-week summer gaming celebration and charity event featuring special guests like Troy Baker, Danny O'Dwyer, and many familiar GameSpot faces.

## Rocket Arena Puts Explosive Twist On Hero Shooters

Rocket Arena is a hero shooter, but with a twist: it’s rockets only. We chatted with Final Strike Games CEO Kevin Franklin on what separates the game from other hero shooters.

As part of Play For All, we chatted with Final Strike Games CEO Kevin Franklin about Rocket Arena, an upcoming hero shooter. As the name suggests, all weapons in Rocket Arena are rocket-based, creating a rather explosive-style of FPS.
 
In the video above, GameSpot host Kurt Indovina and Franklin talk about the process of how Final Strike Games designed Rocket Arena to appeal to a younger audience. Franklin previously worked on shooters like Halo 4, Halo 5: Guardians, and Doom--mechanically solid games, but not exactly approachable to kids in terms of content and the gameplay loop in the multiplayer.
 
That's where Rocket Arena's respawn mechanic comes in. As opposed to dying like in most shooters, you're knocked out of the arena in Rocket Arena. When you're sent flying out, you soar to the top of the arena and get a bird's eye view of the battle below--giving you a chance to forge a strategy and see where all the players are (both enemies and allies) before falling to earth.
 
Rocket Arena is scheduled to release for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. The game will support cross-play between all systems at launch.

Like its predecessor, The Last of Us Part 2 is a brutal game in which you'll have to fight for survival. There are a whole bunch of people who want to kill you in Naughty Dog's post-apocalyptic world, and only some of them are the fungally infected monsters who will rip out your throat and eat you alive. To make it through, you're going to need a lot of skills, both for staying hidden to avoid danger and for killing things and people before they have a chance to kill you.

Check out the video above, where we've put together seven essential tips that will help you get used to the post-apocalypse, make the most of your game, and help Ellie survive to exact her revenge.

If you're a fan of The Last of Us, you might think you have a pretty good handle on how to stay alive as you patrol the area around Jackson or venture into the Seattle QZ. But protagonist Ellie has a bunch of new abilities for you to master this time out, which can have a big impact on the way you play. There are new enemies and challenges to face, as well, and they're out for your blood.

What's more, Naughty Dog has included a bunch of new features for accessibility, allowing you to tune much of The Last of Us Part 2 to be exactly the experience you want, and to offer your ideal challenge. Watch the video above for more on what you'll need to know about The Last of Us Part 2, and stay tuned to GameSpot.com for more The Last of Us Part 2 guides, Easter eggs, and coverage.
