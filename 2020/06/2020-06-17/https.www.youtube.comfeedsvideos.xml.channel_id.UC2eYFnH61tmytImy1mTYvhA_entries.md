If you don't have your own website, you're just living as a peasant on Reddit or Facebook or Twitter's virtual apartments. Get your own domain name and a VPS to host everything you need. The startup and maintenance costs are pocket change and you get a degree of independence unseen in the modern controlled internet.

To register a domain name, absolutely use Epik (https://www.epik.com/?affid=we2ro7sa6) their prices are as cheap as they get and they have an open commitment to not banning people when asked by media mobs. If you get a domain name from the link above I get some Epik credit so I can continue to keep my domains up after I die lol

To host a website, get a VPS. I use Vultr (https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8384069-6G). That link gives you a free one month credit of $100 to play around with whatever want for then. There are other VPS hosts like Linode and Digital Ocean that are common and good as well. Again, I pay less than $5 for one VPS that handles my three websites, email server, git server, search engine and can be used as a Google Drive file-storage equivalent.

If you want to keep your projects on your own server or website, without using Github or Gitlab or a similar site, it's actually extremely easily. In this video, I set up a git server on my website at git.lukesmith.xyz. It is easy and doesn't really cause any bandwidth strain or other issues. Later, I'll be adding on a GUI html interface called stagit.
