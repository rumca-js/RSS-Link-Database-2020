-----------------------
You’re Jordan Goudreau a former special forces soldier with a decent history. Your friends had nothing but good stuff to say about you and described you as top of your class. You were a self-proclaimed “freedom fighter”. But like many life-long warfighters, when your time in the military was up, you’re left with the challenge of finding your place in society. That challenge came with troubling money problems.

Fast forward to March 2019, and the US announced that they’re indicting Venezuela’s very sketchy “President”, Nicolás Maduro, along with his cronies on charges of money laundering etc

You had been conveniently awarded a very fat contract to take down Maduro from his arch nemesis, Juan Guaidó. This contract was for a very respectable $1.5m retainer and $213m in future payoffs. A lot of money.

when that deal feel through, this became the get rich quick money making scheme you need.

If you’re gonna overthrow a government, you’re gonna need some help - so it’s time to recruit your all-star team. One of these soldiers that you teamed up with was a guy named Cliver Alcalá. A retired general in the Venezuelan army. He's got a lot of connections, knows the lay of the land, and can give this coup a lot of power behind it.

With you and the general teamed up, it’s time to put together the soldiers. Sketchy general, hungry untrained soldiers, lack of equipment…Not the SEAL Team 6 you were hoping for, but for the money, status, and freedom? We’ll make it work!

Codenamed “Operation Gideon”. Ideally, your invasion would spark a popular rebellion in the locals to help you along the way. Maduro will be in Florida to face prosecution, You’ll get your money to pay off all your debts and to make you a pretty rich man, And you’ll be hailed as the man who single handedly orchestrated the modern day revolution of Venezuela. Reality, however, was different.

Leading up to the invasion, more defectors were being recruited into the camps even if the money and equipment wasn’t arriving, and you were training them. Almost in an instant - the house of cards fell down. But there’s still a silver lining in this mess - the US also just put a $15m bounty on Maduro.
