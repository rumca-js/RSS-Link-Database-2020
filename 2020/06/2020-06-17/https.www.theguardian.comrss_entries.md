<p>Stradivarius deserves plenty of respect as he seeks his Gold Cup hat-trick, but the bookmakers have him too short</p><p>Stradivarius deserves plenty of respect as he seeks his Gold Cup hat-trick at Royal Ascot on Thursday but the bookmakers have him very short indeed at 4-7 after a couple of defeats. After all, it is just 13 days since he chased Ghaiyyath’s tail in the Coronation Cup, which is hardly a conventional Gold Cup preparation.</p><p>At 10-1, <strong>Moonlight Spirit (3.35)</strong> is an interesting alternative, since the Godolphin horse seems on his way to becoming a decent stayer. He was run down late by Technician in France last autumn but has been gelded since and could prove a different proposition this year. Nayef Road has to be taken seriously after his Sagaro success on his first attempt at two miles. Rain would be a problem for Mark Johnston’s chestnut, but if the storms miss Ascot he should get into the argument.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/jun/18/talking-horses-moonlight-spirit-can-spring-a-surprise-in-gold-cup-royal-ascot-horse-racing">Continue reading...</a>

After selling his previous business – the sports brand Howies – to Timberland in 2006, he set up Hiut in 2012 with his wife, Clare. Based in Cardigan in west Wales, the company is located in the former premises of what was the UK’s biggest denim factory, which sadly closed its doors 10 years prior.</p><p>Hieatt’s aim? To re-employ some of the 400 or so “grandmasters” – his term for the highly skilled and experienced factory workers responsible for creating garments – who lost their jobs in 2002. Thanks to soaring demand, there are now 30 people on the payroll. With a focus on sustainability and ethically made fashion, the future looked promising. Alongside initiatives such as “free repairs for life”, the brand has launched inventive ranges such as jeans made from banana fibres. Then Covid-19 struck.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/jun/17/people-buy-special-things-how-a-denim-firm-and-a-metal-foundry-kept-running-during-lockdown">Continue reading...</a>

She talks about the racist role that caused ‘a disturbance’ in her soul – and why working with Lars von Trier gave her acne </p><p>When actor Bryce Dallas Howard started making the documentary <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/bryce-dallas-howards-dads-trailer/">Dads</a>, her family was clear: this was not going to be about them. Her father <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/ron-howard">Ron</a>, the Oscar-winning director of A Beautiful Mind, was adamant that he wouldn’t appear on screen, despite having signed on as producer, while her husband, the actor Seth Gabel, told her: “Don’t make this ‘The Howard Show.’” Then, during production, her brother Reed found out he was going to become a parent. “I needed an expectant father in the film,” she tells me. “So I was, like, ‘All bets are off!’” Now her brother, father and late grandfather all feature in the end product, which is as frothy and sweet-smelling as anyone would expect from something <a href="https://www.dove.com/ca/en/men-care/paternity-leave-resources/dads--a-documentary-on-fatherhood-and-paternity-leave.html">made in partnership with </a><a href="https://www.dove.com/ca/en/men-care/paternity-leave-resources/dads--a-documentary-on-fatherhood-and-paternity-leave.html"> Dove</a> Men+Care.</p><p>With her pale skin, copper hair and faintly febrile manner, the 39-year-old Howard is far more interesting than the film. There’s been an eclectic element to many of her career choices: she took over from Nicole Kidman as Grace, the well-meaning reformer whose good intentions go awry, in Lars von Trier’s harrowing Dogville sequel <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2006/mar/03/2">Manderlay</a>, a disquisition on slavery that was shot, like its predecessor, on a bare sound stage with minimal props. (A final instalment, with Howard and Kidman playing sisters, was proposed by Von Trier but never materialised.) She was haunting in two M Night Shyamalan mysteries, one eerie (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1286595,00.html">The Village)</a>, the other disastrous (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/aug/11/sciencefictionandfantasy.thriller">Lady in the Water</a>), and brought some pep to a run of tired franchises (Spider-Man, Twilight, Terminator, Jurassic World) as well as the odd prestige project. She was central to the only memorable scene in <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2017/03/31/the-help-minny-chocolate-pie-recipe/">The Help</a>, as the segregationist housewife chowing down on poo pie, and appeared last year as Elton John’s brittle, acidic mother in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/may/16/rocketman-review-elton-john-biopic-thats-better-at-the-tiaras-than-the-tantrums">Rocketman</a>.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/17/bryce-dallas-howard-interview-dads-changing-diapers-is-still-somehow-revolutionary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Layer upon layer of ridiculous ice-cream decadence: is it even possible to make the definitive knickerbocker glory?</p><p>An appropriately magnificent name for the king of ice-cream sundaes – almost 70 years on, my dad still hasn’t got over the fact that he was never allowed one on his annual childhood trip to the seaside. Too dear, at 2/6d, for little boys, apparently. Every time we go into <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/26/classic-seaside-cafes-neon-nougat-knickerbocker-glories">Morelli’s</a>, still going strong in all its 1950s splendour on Broadstairs seafront, he looks wistfully at the menu before ordering a coffee, yet when we finally treated him, he had to give up after two mouthfuls. Which is why you should indulge yourself now – there’s never been a better time.</p><p>Oddly enough, though the knickerbocker glory is now thought of as a very British treat, it seems to have its origins in the United States, spiritual home of the sundae (where it was,<a href="http://www.theoldfoodie.com/2006/11/sundae-any-day.html"> according to historian Janet Clarkson</a>, probably created as a response to strict Sabbath trading laws): the first record seems to be in a 1915 handbook for soda fountain proprietors. The name wouldn’t have seemed so wonderfully strange over there, Knickerbocker being the Dutch-American hero of Washington Irving’s 1809 A History of New York, who, in turn, lent his name to knee breeches; Clarkson suggests the link might be the socks worn below these garments, which makes sense, because the knickerbocker glory’s defining feature is its colourful layers, striped with promise.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/17/how-to-make-the-perfect-knickerbocker-glory-recipe-felicity-cloake">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The Cape Wrath Challenge at the northern tip of Scotland was dreamed up by a postwar cycling enthusiast who thought that bike touring clubs were turning soft</p><p>At the north-western tip of Scotland, cut off from the mainland by a tidal inlet that can be treacherous to cross, is a single-track road that winds for 11 miles through desolate moorland to a squat Victorian lighthouse at the edge of Cape Wrath. The road has barely been touched since it was first built in 1826 to bring in the materials to build the lighthouse. It would otherwise have gone unnoticed were it not for an adventurous bike enthusiast who founded one of Britain’s oldest ongoing cycling challenges here in 1949.</p><p>The Cape Wrath Fellowship was started by Rex Coley, a cycling journalist who wrote under the pseudonym “Ragged Staff’ - in honour of the crest of his native Warwickshire. Rex wrote for a magazine called Cycling (the predecessor to Cycling Weekly) and edited The Bicycle at a time when, like now, cycling was enjoying a period of widespread popularity. According to cycling historian Sheila Hanlon: “When safety bicycles became more affordable after the turn of the [20th] century, touring the countryside served as a means of escape from the polluted city air and stress of modern life for working-class men and women.” Club rides saw hundreds of cyclists take to the roads to enjoy “the socially transformative power of an open-air experience in the countryside”. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/17/cape-wrath-cycling-challenge-scotland-uk-toughest-bike-ride">Continue reading...</a>

Kelly has been building, repairing and talking guitars on the site since 1991, having spent the 1970s punk era around the corner on Downing Street. “The city was real gritty and dirty back then, you couldn’t even walk in Central Park, you’d get mugged for sure,” Kelly says. “I liked it that way.”</p><p>Carmine Street Guitars, the subject of a delightful documentary by Ron Mann, is one of the last redoubts of “Old New York” as Kelly calls it. On a typical day, Kelly’s elderly mother Dorothy will be working the cash register; his 26-year-old apprentice Cindy Hulej, will be blow-torching a custom design on to a guitar body; while Kelly will be at his workbench planing away a piece of wood. At one point in the film, Hulej teases Kelly for not having a cellphone or the internet. “You need to move into the 21st century.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/17/carmine-street-guitars-new-york-history-wood-rick-kelly-documentary">Continue reading...</a>

<p>When Keir Starmer was elected as Labour’s new leader in March he was pitched straight into the coronavirus crisis and denied even the chance to hold a victory party. But with public disquiet setting in over the government’s response, Starmer’s own ratings are surging</p><p>After a months-long campaign to succeed Jeremy Corbyn, <strong>Sir Keir Starmer </strong>was eventually elected leader of the Labour party in March, just as the country was entering lockdown and parliament suspended. It was a time of national crisis and public opinion was broadly supportive of the government’s emergency measures. </p><p>But as the Guardian’s political editor, <strong>Heather Stewart, </strong>tells <strong>Anushka Asthana, </strong>as satisfaction with the government’s handling of coronavirus has dipped, Keir Starmer’s ratings show the best start to the job of any opposition leader in living memory. It follows confident performances in the Commons and a clear-out of prominent Corbyn allies from the shadow cabinet. So is the party now united behind its new leader? </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/17/how-is-keir-starmer-changing-the-labour-party-podcast">Continue reading...</a>
