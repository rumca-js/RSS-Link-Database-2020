<p>Dan Brown’s 100m-selling book is being adapted for the theatre for the first time</p><p><em>Renowned author Dan Brown looked on proudly at the stage, which resembled a kind of raised platform made of wood. The blackened silhouettes of the actors dazzled him with their bright blue eyes and ghostly white faces. But as he stared with the eyes located under his side-parted hair, a terrible fear gripped him gently. Was this performance about to become a critical hit? Or would the stage adaption of his novel The Da Vinci Code merely cement his reputation as a terrible writer?</em></p><p>Theatregoers in the UK are about to find out as Brown’s 2003 bestseller hits the stage for the first time next year. The book defied <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/may/08/jodi-picoult-da-vinci-code">its critics</a>, selling 100m copies despite being described by Salman Rushdie as “a novel so bad that it gives bad novels a bad name”.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/jun/26/bestselling-novel-the-da-vinci-code-to-hit-the-stage-in-london">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Nowadays, we’re familiar with the need to stay inside. But for Kiera Moran, the type of measures put in place to tackle coronavirus were nothing new</p><p>On my 23rd birthday, I’d been inside for a week. This is not an unusual statement now, but that birthday was last year. My time had been almost entirely spent in a single, unfamiliar room, disinfected of normality. Instead of the sound of birds, or the wind through the trees, I heard rhythmic beeps and footsteps.</p><p>In this room, time slowed: the variation between day and night became less noticeable. The buzz of fluorescent lights accompanied the buzz in my head. Slowly, the days had become somewhat more peaceful. Tears had stopped. Medication had kicked in. My four-year-old-son, asleep next to me, was being fed through a tube.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-voice-your-way/2020/jun/26/what-i-learned-about-self-isolation-a-year-before-lockdown-with-my-son-who-had-cancer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Writer Sam Carrick on suddenly finding approval from wider society via a name badge</p><p>An average day for me begins at 3am. I’m definitely not a morning person, but I have a job to do. I am currently working for a large supermarket chain. I arrive at work for 5am. I pick people’s online shopping, stock shelves and interact with the public, from a safe distance, of course. People ask about stock levels and if the restrictions are really necessary and, of course, the answers are yes, the limits are required, and no, there isn’t more stock “in the back”. I finish at 9am, go home, sleep off the sore feet and tired eyes, and then wake in the afternoon to do it all again for my next split shift.</p><p>Strangely, what would be considered as a job at the bottom of society is currently one of the most valued. It’s a job that I mainly picked up to earn some money before starting my degree in September, but now it grants me hero-worship from strangers. A round of applause in the doorway. A level of respect that someone like me could never hope to have outside of an international pandemic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/your-voice-your-way/2020/jun/26/as-a-keyworker-im-valued-once-lockdown-ends-this-will-melt-away">Continue reading...</a>

## As a black TV writer in a white industry, we need support – not doubt

<p>Working in the world of TV, a small core of black writers, including myself, often find ourselves dismissed and undermined. It is time for change <br /></p><p>Ask any black person in the UK how they are feeling, and they will probably tell you they are exhausted. Aside from the usual struggles of being black in Britain, we’ve found our inboxes filled with messages from white people discovering racism for the first time, apologising for their complicity or stating passionately that they must do better. We know it comes from a good place, but your white guilt has become black admin.</p><p>The plus side is that it shows there seems to be a genuine shift in the conversation. However, I worry that many individuals and companies don’t know what real solidarity is. It was just a few weeks ago that vast swathes of the British TV industry were flooding their social media feeds with black squares and statements of solidarity. Unsurprisingly, with the industry’s poor track record on diversity, the vast majority of us met this with side-eye (the black equivalent to a raised eyebrow), knowing that it would probably mean little more than a few extra jobs for black and brown actors. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/jun/26/trust-and-support-us-rather-than-doubting-us-tales-from-a-black-tv-writer">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With many UK holidaymakers desperate to go abroad, here’s what to expect from next week’s eagerly awaited announcement on air bridges</p><p><strong>What is an air bridge?<br /></strong>An air bridge, or travel corridor, is a reciprocal agreement between two countries that allows tourists to travel without restrictions. It would mean that UK holidaymakers could visit countries with low coronavirus infection rates without having to quarantine for 14 days when they return – and people in those countries can travel to the UK without having to quarantine on entry.</p><p><strong>What countries will the UK have air bridges with? <br /></strong>The first air bridges are likely to be with popular European destinations including France, Spain, Italy, Germany and Greece. Portugal is uncertain, as there has been a spike in infection rates, and other notable omissions may be Croatia, Malta and Turkey. The second set of air bridges is thought to include Denmark, the Netherlands, Finland and Norway, plus some Caribbean islands. There are also reports of a long-haul air bridge with Australia. There are no plans for an air bridge with the US at this stage.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/jun/26/what-are-bridges-where-do-they-go-will-they-affect-my-holiday">Continue reading...</a>

## 'We’'ll have to learn to slurp spaghetti without splashing our fellow diners with Covid' | Grace Dent on restaurants

<p>Alfresco dining will please some people but it’s impossible to eat at an outside table without buskers turning up to play La Bamba on their accordions</p><p>While I was loitering in an alley and eating chips from <a href="https://www.toffsfish.co.uk/">Toffs in Muswell Hill</a> earlier this week, before spending an hour on a cold, stone wall outside a pub – just asking for piles, my gran would say – I realised that the current half-and-half world of going out would have suited the 16-year-old me right down to the ground. Me now, though, not so much. But back when someone simply owning a car, usually a Ford Fiesta XR2i, was seen as thrilling, I’d have loved that “eating out” meant sitting in a car park and looking at a wall. I’m much fussier now. As the government begins to let us out, softly softly, while hoping to boost the economy, it has possibly not bargained on how lukewarm many of us still are about even leaving the house.<br /><br />The chips were wonderful, by the way, and I was thrilled to see Toffs back open again after its co-owner, George Georgiou, passed away from coronavirus in April. There was a queue twirling down the street from 4pm, which was a lovely sight, but the guidelines on dining have been confused – never mind 1m or 2m: could we share tables with who we like, or did we have to stay in our “bubbles”? Should older people wear ribbons? This new world hasn’t been quite as good as simply not bothering.<br /><br />Since lockdown, I have been through my time of railing against my robbed freedom, but then I began cultivating rhododendrons, studying the Stuart dynasty, padding around the house bra-less and letting my toe hair grow wispy. Work-wise, I have started filming for TV shows by receiving a camera delivered by courier, setting it up and filming myself looking human only from the waist up, which is all a bit <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/3r2cnZ9Cvg2lZ7Ff0ZjrC4W/davros">Davros from Doctor Who</a>. Hell, I’m even growing cut-and-come-again lettuce and no one is wanging on about Glastonbury. And none of this is too shabby.</p><p>Then, in late May, I rushed out of the house and punched the air to celebrate the fact that the new world was finally starting. I stood in some queues for shops, inhaled a traffic jam, watched a few park revellers piss in the bushes, then I went back indoors again. It’s nice in here. Going out when you’re young, nubile and want to hook up is understandable, but the next stage of finishing lockdown should involve Boris and Rishi visiting each and every Generation X household individually to convince us why we need to go back outside.<br /><br />One thing that may lure folk out is the tentative plan to turn Britain’s town centres into pedestrianised eating zones. Fans of alfresco dining will be delighted to know that London’s West End is sealing off some roads so the restaurants can flood out on to the street in order to maintain safer distances while we slurp our spaghetti in a way that does not splash our fellow diners with Covid. Where London goes, other cities will hopefully follow, and this will certainly please some people.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/26/we-ll-have-to-learn-to-slurp-spaghetti-without-splashing-our-fellow-diners-with-covid-grace-dent-restaurants">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For former Royal Marine Sam Murray from Derbyshire, volunteering to help the local community during Covid-19 was a no-brainer. But using his skills to work as a mortuary technician was an experience that had a profound impact</p><p>“If it was my mum, grandma or son, I’d want someone looking after them”, says ex-Royal Marine commando, Sam Murray, who in April found himself volunteering as a mortuary technician, in response to the strain key workers suddenly faced. Having served in the marines from 1988 through to 1996, Murray had spotted a plea for help from fellow former marine Richard Sharp on social media. As CEO of charity Re:Act Disaster Response (formerly Team Rubicon UK), Sharp had requested military veterans urgently lend their skills to the crisis, which Murray says he was eager to do.</p><p>“When Covid-19 was starting, I could see it all unfolding and wanted to help,” he says. “I thought: ‘I can’t just sit here, I need to do something.’ I saw they needed veteran volunteers, so I rang Richard up and said: ‘Right, get me involved.’” It meant Murray was given the daunting task of selecting, training and heading up a team of 12 veteran volunteers to work as mortuary technicians for five weeks. Stationing the teams across two hospital mortuaries in the north-west, Murray worked across both for three weeks. What he saw changed his life.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/all-in-all-together/2020/jun/26/i-needed-to-do-something-the-veteran-who-found-a-new-life-as-a-volunteer-during-coronavirus">Continue reading...</a>

Yet his first-round match against Eibar’s Edu Expósito never took place. The reason? Barca are an official PES 2020 partner club – and publisher Konami reportedly wasn’t keen for him to promote its main rival. It was the latest shot in a turf war going back 25 years.</p><p>When Fifa International Soccer launched on Mega Drive in December 1993, its competitors were already beginning to look old-fashioned. Contemporary hits Kick Off 2 and Sensible Soccer both adopted an overhead view and lacked any kind of big-league sponsorship. But Fifa was a flashy newcomer, designed for the 16-bit console era, and within a month it had sold 500,000 copies. Critics and football fans loved its isometric viewpoint, realistic animations, end-to-end action and spectacular bicycle kicks. “The word ‘classic’ is used too much,” wrote Mean Machines Sega magazine, awarding it 94%, “but anyone who plays Fifa Soccer must concede that this IS football.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/jun/26/fifa-v-pes-pro-evolution-soccer-the-history-of-gamings-greatest-rivalry">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The actor is playing against type as a violent fugitive in his new film, finally out after years of post-production. He discusses toxic masculinity, prosthetic penises – and tricky family members<br /></p><p>Freddie Fox – son of Edward, nephew of James, brother of Emilia and cousin to the Question Time racism refusenik Laurence – is under no illusions about how he is regarded. “‘Oh, let’s get Freddie in to play the nasty posh guy,’” he says. Rare is the script that doesn’t require him to play gay, decadent or beastly, preferably in spiffy period dress. He’s been a Bullingdon bullyboy (The Riot Club), Louis XIII (The Three Musketeers) and a perky Cambridge graduate in Victorian sitcom Year of the Rabbit, though he first caught the eye when he starred in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=la0-ecUwSZ4">Worried About the Boy</a> as the singer Marilyn, all lippy and leopard print. “If I need to play a few posh boys to pay the bills then fine,” he tells me via Zoom from his London living room. “But I want to be Iago, Hamlet, David Bowie. I want to explore all the costumes in the cupboard.”</p><p>He plays strikingly against type as a violent fugitive in his new film. Or rather, his old film: the 17th-century Shropshire western Fanny Lye Deliver’d wrapped in May 2016, then underwent a protracted post-production period. He was 26 when shooting started; he’s now 31. How’s his memory? “They sent me the trailer. That brought a lot of it back.” He remembers, for instance, the seven-week shoot becoming 10. The rain fell, the set flooded, the midges had a field day. At least the punishing conditions suited the material. “The Holiday wouldn’t have worked there,” he agrees.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jun/26/freddie-fox-someone-may-do-or-say-twattish-things-but-thats-not-who-they-are">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Meeting up with friends, going to restaurants and shops – it’s the thrill of a lifetime. For a bit</p><p>The first day we went to the playground it was empty. It was a sweltering Sunday afternoon in the city, and although it was the day before playgrounds in New York officially reopened, someone kind had unbolted the gate. After almost four months of being locked out, my children stood still, staring at the swings as if they’d never seen them before, and eventually ran off to play. This particular playground, surrounded by 30-storey apartment blocks and abutting a school, was latterly one of the busiest in my neighbourhood and if there was something chilling about being the only ones there, it also permitted a delusion: that we, and the city, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/22/new-york-city-coronavirus-pandemic-survival">had changed</a>.</p><p>The phrase I keep hearing and using myself this week, is, “We can’t go on like this for ever.” It’s one of those statements, like “it is what it is”, and “what are you going to do?” that seeks, in the absence of external causes for cheer, nonetheless to make us feel better. In this case, it is also exculpatory.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/26/kids-playground-reopened-meet-friends-restaurants-shops">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Although Covid-19 scuppered Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary, organisers Michael and Emily Eavis discuss the moments that made it the world’s greatest festival – from the healing fields to Stormzy</p><p>Glastonbury festival’s first ever booking came from Michael Eavis serenading his cows with the Kinks. “I was playing Lola to them through a sound system in the milking parlour,” he says. “I’d been to Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at Shepton Mallet showground, wandering in on the Sunday because there was no fence left by then. I was totally inspired. Jean and I had just fallen in love and we were all loved up, among all those bands and millions of people … I’d never seen a hippy in my life before – the boys and girls all looked the same! From that, I was determined to do an event of my own. I had a better site, facing Glastonbury Tor in the vale of Avalon – it was all a bit romantic.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/26/from-bowie-to-beyonce-glastonburys-50-greatest-moments">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities. Looking back, he sees some signs of hope amid the devastation. But will the government change its approach for the impending Covid-19 economic crash?</p><p>When George Osborne delivered his spending review in June 2010 it ushered in what would become a decade of austerity measures. As budgets were slashed for children’s centres, libraries, parks and welfare, they were accompanied with the phrase “we are all in this together”. </p><p>The Guardian columnist <strong>John Harris </strong>has been touring the country for the entire decade, chronicling the devastation that those cuts have made in local communities for his award-winning series Anywhere But Westminster. He tells <strong>Rachel Humphreys </strong>how his latest reporting on the Barnsley village of Thurnscoe is illustrative of what austerity does to a place. He finds children’s centres cut, the landscape blighted with litter and unmown verges, parks in disrepair and libraries curtailed. </p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/jun/26/after-a-decade-of-austerity-what-now">Continue reading...</a>
