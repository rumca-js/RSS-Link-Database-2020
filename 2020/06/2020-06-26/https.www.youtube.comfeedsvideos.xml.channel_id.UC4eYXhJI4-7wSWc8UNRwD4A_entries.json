Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit \u2014 stripped-down sets, an intimate setting \u2014 just a different space.\n\nJune 26, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- The Jamaica-born, Miami-raised reggae artist BEAM is no stranger to the limelight. His father, Papa San, was a dancehall superstar during the late 1980s and early '90s before becoming a preacher. That combo meant BEAM developed musically and spiritually from an early age. Proudly reppin' a Broward County hoodie, the 23-year-old singer and his co-producer and keyboardist, Al Cres, brought a new flair to the Tiny Desk (home) concert series with some unorthodox visual effects. BEAM's light-hearted gravitas and charisma shine through from start to finish. \"MAD GAAL,\" featured on his 2019 major-label debut, 95, is sure to keep living room dancefloors bumping during the pandemic. He concluded the set with an exclusive: \"KUMBAYA\", a fitting song for this moment in history.\n\nSET LIST\n\"SOLDIER\"\n\"MAD GAAL\"\n\"STRANDED\n\"KUMBAYA\"\n\nMUSICIANS\nAl Cres: keyboard\n\nCREDITS\nVideographer: BEAM; Audio Engineer: BEAM; Producer: Abby O'Neill; Audio Mastering Engineer: Josh Rogosin; Video Producer: Morgan Noelle Smith; Associate Producer: Bobby Carter; Executive Producer: Lauren Onkey; Senior VP, Programming: Anya Grundmann", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uz5Kgcjiasc", "date_published": "2020-06-26 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
