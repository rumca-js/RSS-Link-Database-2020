The Tiny Desk is working from home for the foreseeable future. Introducing NPR Music's Tiny Desk (home) concerts, bringing you performances from across the country and the world. It's the same spirit — stripped-down sets, an intimate setting — just a different space.

June 26, 2020 | Abby O'Neill -- The Jamaica-born, Miami-raised reggae artist BEAM is no stranger to the limelight. His father, Papa San, was a dancehall superstar during the late 1980s and early '90s before becoming a preacher. That combo meant BEAM developed musically and spiritually from an early age. Proudly reppin' a Broward County hoodie, the 23-year-old singer and his co-producer and keyboardist, Al Cres, brought a new flair to the Tiny Desk (home) concert series with some unorthodox visual effects. BEAM's light-hearted gravitas and charisma shine through from start to finish. "MAD GAAL," featured on his 2019 major-label debut, 95, is sure to keep living room dancefloors bumping during the pandemic. He concluded the set with an exclusive: "KUMBAYA", a fitting song for this moment in history.
