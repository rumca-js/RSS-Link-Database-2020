Me now, though, not so much. But back when someone simply owning a car, usually a Ford Fiesta XR2i, was seen as thrilling, I\u2019d have loved that \u201ceating out\u201d meant sitting in a car park and looking at a wall. I\u2019m much fussier now. As the government begins to let us out, softly softly, while hoping to boost the economy, it has possibly not bargained on how lukewarm many of us still are about even leaving the house.<br /><br />The chips were wonderful, by the way, and I was thrilled to see Toffs back open again after its co-owner, George Georgiou, passed away from coronavirus in April. There was a queue twirling down the street from 4pm, which was a lovely sight, but the guidelines on dining have been confused \u2013 never mind 1m or 2m: could we share tables with who we like, or did we have to stay in our \u201cbubbles\u201d? Should older people wear ribbons? This new world hasn\u2019t been quite as good as simply not bothering.<br /><br />Since lockdown, I have been through my time of railing against my robbed freedom, but then I began cultivating rhododendrons, studying the Stuart dynasty, padding around the house bra-less and letting my toe hair grow wispy. Work-wise, I have started filming for TV shows by receiving a camera delivered by courier, setting it up and filming myself looking human only from the waist up, which is all a bit <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/3r2cnZ9Cvg2lZ7Ff0ZjrC4W/davros\">Davros from Doctor Who</a>. Hell, I\u2019m even growing cut-and-come-again lettuce and no one is wanging on about Glastonbury. And none of this is too shabby.</p><p>Then, in late May, I rushed out of the house and punched the air to celebrate the fact that the new world was finally starting. I stood in some queues for shops, inhaled a traffic jam, watched a few park revellers piss in the bushes, then I went back indoors again. It\u2019s nice in here. Going out when you\u2019re young, nubile and want to hook up is understandable, but the next stage of finishing lockdown should involve Boris and Rishi visiting each and every Generation X household individually to convince us why we need to go back outside.<br /><br />One thing that may lure folk out is the tentative plan to turn Britain\u2019s town centres into pedestrianised eating zones. Fans of alfresco dining will be delighted to know that London\u2019s West End is sealing off some roads so the restaurants can flood out on to the street in order to maintain safer distances while we slurp our spaghetti in a way that does not splash our fellow diners with Covid. Where London goes, other cities will hopefully follow, and this will certainly please some people.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/26/we-ll-have-to-learn-to-slurp-spaghetti-without-splashing-our-fellow-diners-with-covid-grace-dent-restaurants\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/26/we-ll-have-to-learn-to-slurp-spaghetti-without-splashing-our-fellow-diners-with-covid-grace-dent-restaurants", "date_published": "2020-06-26 11:00:03+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "I never started a family as I was caring for Mum.
