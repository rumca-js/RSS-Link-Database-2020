All of that is being sequenced by the Hermod.\n\nDrums from the vpme QD drum module, with a fair amount of modulation, including a gate with a big width set to change the decay of the snare every few bars. Key Step Pro is sequencing the drums, and I use the mutes on the QD and the fill buttons on the KSP for performance effects.\n\nBecause the KSP is clocking the ADE-32 for modulation, when I use fills on the KSP it temporarily messes up the clocking on the ADE-32 and makes the modulation rates change in interesting ways.\n\nFinally, the After Later Monsoon (a MI Clouds clone) is getting fed ramps from ADE-32 to modulate everything on it, and I am playing around with the sliders on the fly to get crazy glitch effects.\n\nMy current rig:\nSquarp Hermod: https://reverb.grsm.io/hermod\nEmpress Effects ZOIA: https://reverb.grsm.io/zoia3787\nMake Noise 0-Coast: https://reverb.grsm.io/0coast\nErica Synths Pico System 3: https://reverb.grsm.io/picosystemiii\nArturia Rackbrute: https://reverb.grsm.io/rackbrute\nArturia Keystep Pro: https://reverb.grsm.io/keysteppro\nArturia Microfreak: https://reverb.grsm.io/microfreak\nMake Noise Maths: https://reverb.grsm.io/maths\nMutable Instruments Plaits, Streams: https://reverb.grsm.io/plaits\nIntellijel Quad VCA: https://reverb.grsm.io/intquadvca\nIME Piston Honda MKIII: https://reverb.grsm.io/pistonhonda\nAfter Later Monsoon: https://reverb.grsm.io/almonsoon\nQD Quad Drum Module: https://reverb.grsm.io/vpmeqd\nBusy Circuits Pam's New Workout: https://reverb.grsm.io/pams\nErica Synths Pico Drum2, Pico Voice: https://reverb.grsm.io/espico\nQuart: https://reverb.grsm.io/quart\n------------------------------------\nPatreon: http://bit.ly/rmrpatreon\nBandcamp: http://bit.ly/2Kq617o\nSoundcloud: http://bit.ly/2NOH9Is\nSpotify: https://spoti.fi/2N40SoX\nGoogle Play: http://bit.ly/33M9aG5\niTunes: https://apple.co/2pqh3SK\nAmazon Music: https://amzn.to/2O9q1fe\nT-Shirts: http://bit.ly/rmrshirts\nTwitter: http://bit.ly/rmrtwitters\nWebsite: http://bit.ly/rmrmedia", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4E4RFRXR6SE", "date_published": "2020-06-27 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
