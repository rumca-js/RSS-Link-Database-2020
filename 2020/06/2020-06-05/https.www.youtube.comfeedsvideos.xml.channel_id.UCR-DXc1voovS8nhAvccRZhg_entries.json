Then I'll deploy Drupal and Wordpress, two popular PHP-based website building CMSes. And then for a little more fun, I deploy Minecraft server using Helm. Then I deploy Pi-hole for ad blocking and custom DNS!\n\nI also am revealing my open source Turing Pi Cluster project on GitHub, to go along with the video series: https://github.com/geerlingguy/turing-pi-cluster\n\nMore details and links (along with a transcript) are available on my blog: https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/raspberry-pi-cluster-episode-4-minecraft-pi-hole-grafana-and-more\n\nAnd here's the open source GitHub project: https://github.com/geerlingguy/turing-pi-cluster\n\nSponsor me on GitHub: https://github.com/sponsors/geerlingguy\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/geerlingguy\n\nChapters:\n\n00:00 - Introduction\n00:24 - On kubectl, tabs and spaces, vim and emacs\n02:03 - The Kubernetes-on-Pi disappointment cycle\n04:09 - The Minecraft server venn diagram\n04:59 - Monitoring suite - Prometheus, AlertManager, and Grafana\n19:43 - Drupal on the Turing Pi\n29:28 - Wordpress on the Turing Pi\n33:49 - Minecraft on the Turing Pi\n44:15 - Pi-hole on the Turing Pi\n52:28 - Summary and What's Next?", "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IafVCHkJbtI", "date_published": "2020-06-05 00:00:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-US"}]
