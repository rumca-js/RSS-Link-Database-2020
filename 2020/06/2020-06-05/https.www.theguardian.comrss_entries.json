Over the last year or so, she\u2019s become more distant. When I asked her whether it had something to do with the other guy, she said no and I believe her.</strong></p><p><strong>Recently my wife acknowledged that she is no longer in love with me; she loves me as the father of her children, admires me, respects me, loves me as a family member, but is neither attracted to me nor in love with me. She said she was considering ending our marriage when the children are grown. I believe this is a very cruel way of playing with my feelings, letting me know that she intends to leave me but that, in the mean</strong><strong>time, she wants to stay with me as a </strong><strong>\u201croomie</strong><strong>\u201d for the children\u2019s sake, and probably also for economical reasons.</strong></p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/05/my-wife-wants-me-to-have-an-affair-with-her-best-friend\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/05/my-wife-wants-me-to-have-an-affair-with-her-best-friend", "date_published": "2020-06-05 14:00:55+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "Jacqueline Wilson asks children to join Silly Squad this summer", "description": "<p>Tracy Beaker author says theme for this year\u2019s Summer Reading Challenge is reading for fun and asks young readers to pick books that make them happy<br /></p><p>British children may be facing a summer in lockdown, but according to the writer Jacqueline Wilson it isn\u2019t the moment to attempt the classics, but for comfort reading.</p><p>Wilson, the former children\u2019s laureate, is calling on children to sign up online for the <a href=\"https://summerreadingchallenge.org.uk/\">Summer Reading Challenge</a>, which launches on Friday.

In the past seven days, my local M&amp;S foodhall has started delivering by bike to my door. Within 25 minutes of ordering, I had full-butter croissants, bits-in orange juice, a fresh bloomer, teabags and jam. This Shangri-la existence was unthinkable three months ago: Marks &amp; Sparks did not do anything as d\u00e9class\u00e9 as Deliveroo, nor did Waitrose deign to send its fancy-pants spelt loaf and Burford Brown eggs on a bike with a two-hour \u201crapid\u201d dispatch. Then the virus came, messed things up and pushed people to be inventive, revise their standards and make money however. We\u2019ve had services we didn\u2019t even know we wanted. Now, a life without them will feel only half-lived.<br /><br />Good luck, for example, to the council busy-bodies who eventually try to pull the plug on straight-to-the-park wine delivery. That genie is now well and truly out of the bottle. Closed pubs and wine shops pivoted to supplying picnickers. \u201cPicnicking\u201d is what we\u2019re now calling getting pie-eyed in the park if you\u2019re wearing a Boden frock, incidentally; if you\u2019re wearing a stained tracksuit, you\u2019re still officially a \u201cstreet-drinker\u201d. Regardless, there\u2019ll be no more byelection votes for anyone who tries to put a stop to this once the virus passes. Likewise, publicans will be hard pressed to call time on collection-only Sunday lunches, because too many of us have grown accustomed to roast beef and trimmings without going through the faff of securing a table. We\u2019ve tasted the new, lazy, have-it-all-right-now world, and it\u2019s delicious.</p><p>But I do worry for businesses lost in the quake. M&amp;S by bike, for example, will have a good go at murdering the returning weekend cafe trade. The Deliveroo fee on my order was \u00a34.50, which is both eye-wateringly steep and also the price of a plate of toasted sourdough at a hip boho cafe. The first option is a bike appearing laden with mollifying treats:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.marksandspencer.com/colin-the-caterpillar-birthday-cake-gift/p/hpp60262271\">Colin the Caterpillar cake</a> and mojito in cans&nbsp;that you can consume from the safety of your sofa while watching <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v5y2\">Saturday Kitchen</a>. The second is leaving your front door to eat toast served in what feels like a working creche by someone wearing a singlet and displaying armpit hair. I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m definitely teetering on preferring the former.<br /><br />What concerns me is that, as well as those cafes, Deliveroo and its kind will in the coming years kill off supermarkets entirely. Or at least turn them into hubs. By targeting grocery supply, the delivery kings will kill off even the arduous task of popping to the shop for \u201cjust bits\u201d.&nbsp;It was, after all, always the bits that were the pain in the neck. They were the problem we didn\u2019t know we needed solving: the missing herbs, the bag of peas, the single lemon. That and the early-morning schlepp to find breakfast items. Those bits that made the weekly big shop stretch much further, but were another to-do on your list.<br /><br />Once, bit-fetching was the job mainly of children. In the 1970s, if I sat too long looking bored, I\u2019d be dispatched to the shop carrying the gas bill with a scribbled note on the back. Yes, I was hoping to lie about watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dum1WJXJMA\">Hong Kong Phooey</a>, yet here I was again buying a can of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IG96TEq2c4\">Nestl\u00e9 Tip Top</a> and a Heinz steamed pudding. By the 90s, we\u2019d got sniffy about sending infants over two lanes of moving traffic to fetch sliced Hovis. It has, I think, something to do with health and safety.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/05/percy-pigs-for-breakfast-and-sourdough-by-bike-the-new-food-world-that-i-wont-give-up-grace-dent\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/05/percy-pigs-for-breakfast-and-sourdough-by-bike-the-new-food-world-that-i-wont-give-up-grace-dent", "date_published": "2020-06-05 09:00:10+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "French winemakers to turn unsold wine into hand gel", "description": "<p>Distilleries authorised to collect 2m hectolitres of unsold wine in EU-backed scheme</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>French winemakers are to turn unsold wine into hand gel and ethanol to make room for this year\u2019s production, the country\u2019s farming agency has said.</p><p>The government agency FranceAgriMer said around 3m hectolitres needed distilling as a result of lower sales during the coronavirus crisis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/french-winemakers-to-turn-unsold-wine-into-hand-gel\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/05/french-winemakers-to-turn-unsold-wine-into-hand-gel", "date_published": "2020-06-05 08:58:00+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "While supermarket workers get extra praise, their bosses get extra pay | Polly Toynbee", "description": "<p>As a dark recession looms, now is the time to make sure no company profits from coronavirus<br /><br /></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Cashing in on coronavirus is a bad look.

Primped young women and hungry young men meet in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/17/london-soho-stories-sex-drugs-rock-and-roll\">a corner of London that is starting to gentrify</a>, although still seedy enough to expose the transactions behind the flirtation. You can almost hear their egos rattle as they use each other for sex and drugs, second-hand cool and sly oneupmanship, parsing the social codes in a suspicious, cinematic rush: \u201cHave you got it? Do you get it? If so, how often? Which do you choose, a hard or soft option?\u201d But a scene\u2019s beautiful people are rarely as captivating as the wallflower at the orgy. After all, the West End girls and East End boys are doomed to a dead-end world. The real glamorous demimonde opened up by West End Girls is that of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/pet-shop-boys\">Pet Shop Boys</a>, perceptive night owls who make a virtue of being outsiders yet understand the allure of the charade.</p><p>Thirty-six years on, their debut single still pulses with that beguiling ambiguity; the exact emotion of Chris Lowe\u2019s glacial chords and abrupt beat, and of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/oct/21/neil-tennant-pet-shop-boys-collection-lyrics\">Neil Tennant</a>\u2019s alternately wry and rhapsodic observations, impossible to pinpoint. Although Tennant cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/27/how-we-made-the-message\">Grandmaster Flash\u2019s The Message</a> as an influence on the rapped verses, West End Girls isn\u2019t so much social commentary on London\u2019s burgeoning yuppie class as it is an impressionist marvel, in which lust, naivety, disco and opaque references to Lenin rush by as if caught in the reflection of a bus window. TS Eliot\u2019s The Waste Land was another influence. Years later, Tennant said he had never understood the poem, \u201cbut the poetry of it, the different voices talking about strange and disparate and even exotic things, is completely riveting and makes you want to read it again and again \u2026 hoping to find new meaning\u201d. Some urbane listeners may have recognised themselves in the song, whether the flirtatious insider or worldly observer. But it is kids who send songs to No 1, and West End Girls was an aperture on to a mysterious adult world, the Pet Shop Boys\u2019 distanced framing as captivating as the picture.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/05/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-1-pet-shop-boys-west-end-girls\">Continue reading...</a>", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/05/the-100-greatest-uk-no-1s-no-1-pet-shop-boys-west-end-girls", "date_published": "2020-06-05 08:00:09+00:00", "persistent": false, "user": null, "language": "en-UK"}, {"source": "https://www.theguardian.com/rss", "title": "The Lancet has made one of the biggest retractions in modern history.
