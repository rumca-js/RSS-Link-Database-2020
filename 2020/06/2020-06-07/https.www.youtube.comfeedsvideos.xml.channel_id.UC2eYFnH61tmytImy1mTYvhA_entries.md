Literally no one wants to see useless standard output on some parent terminal that will close whatever media file you open from it. dwm solves this problem by having a swallow/swallowing patch: it automatically places media windows exactly over the terminals you start them from. When you exit out of these windows, your terminal is still there, safe and sound. It's basically like consooming media in the terminal itself in terms of efficiency.
