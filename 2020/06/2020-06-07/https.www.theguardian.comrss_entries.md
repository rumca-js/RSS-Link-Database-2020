<p>From nursing mothers to senior catizens, you see it all as a foster carer</p><p>Nearly three years ago my wife and I had to move from New York – where we met, where I had lived for almost eight years, and where we had made a home – back to my home town of Melbourne. We missed (and continue to miss) many things about New York: our friends, our favourite bar, our neighbourhood, the fact that one can actually make a living there as a writer.</p><p>But most of all, we missed our cat, who stayed in NYC with a friend. It’s hard to say why, exactly – she’s a singular creature. She used to amuse herself by trying to trip my wife during the night, as she navigated the weird spiral staircase in our Brooklyn apartment – but we missed her nonetheless.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/08/in-18-months-weve-had-30-cats-and-its-been-wonderful">Continue reading...</a>

<p>An American death has sparked global protest and confronted other countries with uncomfortable truths</p><p>George Floyd’s name is now known around the globe; his death has sparked protests from Berlin to Mexico City. The extraordinary cruelty of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd" title="">his killing</a> has shocked the world. But his death has resonated so widely not because it was exceptional, but because it was not. Not exceptional in the US, where the toll of African Americans who have died at police hands is long and shameful. And not, unfortunately, exceptional elsewhere.</p><p>Tens of thousands gathered at the weekend in London, Manchester, Cardiff, Glasgow and other parts of the UK. In Bristol, protesters toppled a statue of slave trader <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/apr/27/bristol-city-slave-trader-edward-colston" title="">Edward Colston</a>. But the movement has also brought people on to the streets in Rio de Janeiro and Buenos Aires; in Abuja and Nairobi; in Barcelona, Copenhagen and Paris. These marches express solidarity and outrage that the richest and most powerful country in the world should continue to treat its people this way. Demonstrators oppose the racial legacy it embodies, and the brutal, militarised police response to protests.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-black-lives-matter-worldwide-a-common-cause">Continue reading...</a>

<p>The BBC can help British classical music recover – if the government steps in too</p><p>When the BBC Radio 3 presenter Andrew McGregor welcomed listeners to last Monday’s <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000jpjm" title="">lunchtime concert</a> from <a href="https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/whats-on/live-music-returns-to-wigmore-hall-in-new-broadcast-series" title="">Wigmore Hall</a> in London, the timbre of his announcement had a curious quality: there was no hum of a crowd’s anticipation behind his words, just a faintly audible echo. It was the sound of absence. The hall’s red-plush seats were empty. There was no one else in the hall apart from him, the pianist Stephen Hough and a tiny number of physically distanced staff. Normally a recital to a deserted hall would be meaningless – what, after all, is a performance if there is no one to perform to? But in this case, the event was freighted with significance.</p><p>It was the first live concert on Radio 3 for 11 weeks, since halls and opera houses abruptly shut their doors in March. The audience was scattered far and wide, listening to the radio or watching online. It was the start of a series running through June; there will be more in the autumn, and further concerts are expected to be broadcast from Glasgow.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/the-guardian-view-on-the-return-of-live-music-hope-and-longing">Continue reading...</a>

<p>(Jewel Runners/BMG)</p><p>“Back at it like a crack addict,” declares Killer Mike, one half of Run the Jewels, on the rappers’ major label debut. The duo’s three previous albums swelled their niche appeal, yet <em>Run the Jewels 4</em> is the first that feels crafted for large gatherings in open spaces. Signing to BMG hasn’t dimmed their political acuity, especially on the chilling Walking in the Snow. In a reference to the 2014 killing of Eric Garner, it features a desperate Mike gasping for air as a racist cop chokes him, before calling out Twitter liberals – their own fans, if truth be told – who tut at their phones then sit on their hands.</p><p>Killer Mike and El-P have always traded dazzlingly intricate verses, all alliteration and propulsive rhymes, over inventive, nonlinear productions, and <em>RTJ4</em> supersizes their outsider aesthetic without squandering any hard-won authenticity. Icy disquisitions on the missing soul of modern America jostle with good-natured boasts from the golden age of hip-hop, yielding a remarkable hit rate. It ends with the riveting, beatless intensity of A Few Words for the Firing Squad, evoking an Outkast gig in outer space.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jun/07/run-the-jewels-run-the-jewels-4-review-a-remarkable-hit-rate">Continue reading...</a>

You sit together in hushed intimacy, just the two of you, finally revealing lifelong secrets. The atmosphere is exquisitely calm, the tranquillity shot through with alertness as the world shifts, brilliantly refigured, and relief floods in. You have the certainty that you are protected and profoundly understood by someone who is on your side. As Freud wrote, “Analysis is, in essence, a cure through love.”</p><p>From the very act of revelation, a feeling of affinity can grow. In such safety and solace, with all the exclusive focus you could ever wish for, you start wondering about this person who sits opposite you – the therapist.

Getting rid of the rectangle of mown grass that passed for a garden was almost the first thing I did when I moved into my new home on a bitterly cold New Year’s Day, 20 years ago. An act of vandalism to some, but to me the patch of brown earth, chips of broken china and old, soil-filled medicine bottles it left behind was just the blank canvas I needed.</p><p>The wielding of the spade must have been symbolic, because I did nothing more outside for months. I wanted to create a place to think. A green space in which to clear my head in between recipes, or to untangle a knotted sentence. A lawn has its uses as a safe place for children to play, somewhere to kick a ball around or to sunbathe, but it wasn’t the right garden for me. I don’t find inspiration or peace in a neatly edged rectangle of grass. All I see is a wasted opportunity. I wanted a garden where my imagination could run, where I could make a home for bees, birds and butterflies and where I could escape to when the house was full of people. A place that would act as both inspiration and sanctuary.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/07/nigel-slater-i-feel-as-if-my-garden-has-finally-come-of-age">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Memorabilia and antiques sales are booming for people with spare cash and plenty of time on their hands</p><p>Frustrated by the returns offered by high street banks and even further frustrated by being forced to stay indoors as a result of the lockdown, investors are looking in unique places to salt away their money. Memorabilia, antiques and other collectibles have seen a mini boom in the last few months. Those with spare cash have been trying to get some positive returns as they have the time to search for opportunities.</p><p>But while the want is clearly there – antique auction website thesaleroom.com reports demand up by almost a fifth – there is the potential for problems. With no regulation and a prevalence of scams, alternative investments could lead to huge losses. Even if you do decide to sell them on, you need to find someone else to buy that unique piece of football memorabilia. For others, looking at rates of barely above zero, the risk is worth it.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/jun/07/investing-take-a-trip-down-memory-lane-in-search-of-better-returns">Continue reading...</a>

<p>A place to socialise, an oasis for wildlife, a gift to our neighbours – a front garden can be all of these things. Isn’t it about time we showed them some love,asks Clare Coulson</p><p>Last month, with more time at home than usual, Charlotte Harris, one half of the landscape design duo <a href="https://www.harrisbugg.com/" title="">Harris Bugg</a>, decided to dig up her paved front garden in Newham, east London. “It was a discussion we’d been having for a while,” says Harris, who gardens with her girlfriend Catriona Knox. They’d already removed the paving from the back garden of their house, which is in a densely populated area of the city undergoing vast amounts of regeneration. “Around here every bit of green space feels precious,” she says. “Obviously there are parks, but I think each of us has to take responsibility for any space we have.”</p><p>As you’d expect in a city, the new front garden needs to work hard to accommodate bins, bikes and a composting hot bin, but Harris is determined to plant as much as possible in the rest of the space, including a small tree (on the shortlist are a Sichuan pepper tree, hawthorn or a Chinese fringe tree) underplanted with perennials and bulbs.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/jun/07/doorstep-delights-why-front-gardens-matter">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Failure to strike an agreement with the EU will inflict a terrible double whammy on the economy</p><p>Britain, an island state highly dependent on imported food, has been lucky not to go hungry during the coronavirus crisis. At the outset of the emergency, when a loo roll was harder to find than a bar of gold bullion, I detected considerable fear among officials and ministers that panic buying would clean out supermarkets and spark food riots. Some of them&nbsp;remembered the old saw that anarchy is only three missed meals away.&nbsp;</p><p>That ugly scenario, which would have added civil disorder to killer contagion, was avoided because supply chains have been protected. Cargo ships and lorry drivers have continued to make deliveries from our neighbours in Europe. Even as borders were closed to most other traffic, everyone came to the sensible conclusion that frontiers had to remain open for freight. For the same reason, the new 14-day quarantine rule that the government is imposing on travellers will not be applied to those hauling goods.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/the-coronavirus-crisis-wont-give-boris-johnson-an-alibi-for-a-calamitous-brexit">Continue reading...</a>

<p>What next for the broadcaster who blew the whistle on gender inequality at the BBC? A groundbreaking TV series on the treasures of Persia, and – if her mum has her way – a crack at Bollywood</p><p>A couple of years ago, Samira Ahmed was <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire/background-to-the-project">interviewed for the BBC’s archives</a> about the roots of her “incredible affection” for the corporation. The interview, to introduce the “<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire">People</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire">, Nation</a><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/100-voices/people-nation-empire">, Empire</a>” strand of the online history, sits alongside footage of the arrival of the Windrush boat at Tilbury docks and clips from <em>The Black and White Minstrel Show</em>. In it, Ahmed describes a trip she made to the Pebble Mill studios in Birmingham, aged nine, to watch her mother, Lalita Ahmed, present a Hindustani chatshow in which British-Asian women discussed everything from yoga to domestic violence. Ahmed, a long way from her home in south-west London, sat wide-eyed up in the gallery. “Everyone there, except for [my mother] and her guests was white,” she recalled. “And everyone was so incredibly polite and professional. I remember the director; I think he was called Jeremy.” Looking back on that visit, she believed “it was quite a life-changing moment for me. It made me realise that people like me were welcome. And people like me could have a career at the BBC, which was for everybody.”</p><p>A little over a decade later, Ahmed won one of the few coveted golden tickets as a graduate trainee in the BBC newsroom. She became a reporter on the <em>Today</em> programme (alongside a youthful Michael Gove) and then on <em>Newsnight</em>, before going on to present <em>Night Waves</em>, <em>The World Tonight</em> and, currently, <em><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qsq5">Front Row</a></em>. It has only perhaps been in the past year, however, that she has written a brand-new chapter in BBC history of her own.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/07/samira-ahmed-run-for-director-general-of-the-bbc-maybe-next-time">Continue reading...</a>

<p>With a mission to Mars on the horizon and astronauts spending longer than ever in orbit, scientists are looking for ways to grow vegetables in space...</p><p>In <em><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/04/the-martian-review-matt-damon-shines-stranded-astronaut" title="">The Martian</a></em>, the 2015 film directed by Ridley Scott, astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) is accidentally abandoned alone on Mars by his crewmates after an emergency evacuation, without enough food to survive. Mars is a tricky prospect for even the most red- fingered gardener: there’s almost no air, the “soil” has few nutrients and lots of heavy metals, and the temperature is typically around -60C. “I’m going to have to science the shit out of this,” Watney, a botanist, declares. He decides to grow potatoes, jerry-rigging a climate-controlled dome, burning hydrazine to make water and creating a growth medium from Mars dust supplemented by his crewmates’ faeces.</p><p>In Star Trek they just replicate food out of pure energy</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/jun/07/gardens-of-the-galaxy-scientists-are-looking-for-ways-to-grow-vegetables-in-space">Continue reading...</a>

<p>For a long time we had to play by a certain rulebook – but now the rules have changed, and I’m still processing it<br /></p><p>How does it feel to be black in America right now? First, I wonder, do I capitalize the “B”? Is that grammatically correct? More to the point, as an element of style, a choice, does it prove something to you or to me if I don’t? I confess I don’t know any more. These are the petty games that play on my mind as a black American.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot speak for all black people, of course. We are not a monolith; you seem to understand this by now. I can only speak for myself – as a black writer. That experience, at least, I know. Instead of worrying about the white man who might murder me in my own home, or on my morning run, what preys on me in the night is how I constructed the sentence as I replay the day, if it was adequately punctuated in its disavowal of racist oppression.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/black-protests-woe-america">Continue reading...</a>

<p>Tony Murray’s image, one of a series exploring an Ireland in thrall to the Catholic church, carries a deeper poignancy today</p><p>Tony Murray’s book <em>Holy Pictures</em> captures the last knockings of an Ireland wholly dominated by the ritual and calendar of the Catholic church.&nbsp;This picture was taken in 1980 in Woodtown, Dublin, at a “pattern Sunday” festival for the local patron saint.&nbsp;The religious ceremonies at St Colmcille’s Well were followed by displays of traditional music. The boy is dancing for a small crowd seated on a grassy bank.&nbsp;</p><p>Murray had not long graduated from the National College of Art and Design and was working at <em>In Dublin</em> magazine, the city’s version of <em>Time Out</em>, alongside young writers including <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/colm-toibin">Colm Tóibín</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/fintan-o-toole">Fintan O’Toole</a>. In his spare time he took pictures of the country’s festivals and processions, its priests and pilgrims&nbsp;–&nbsp;in the mountains of Mayo or the shabbier parts of towns – always with a street photographer’s eye for comic juxtaposition or poignant contradiction. All of the pictures were taken after the visit of John Paul II in 1979, when more than half of the population turned out for a glimpse of the pope, but before the exposure of child abuse scandals that fatally loosened the church’s grip on Irish society.&nbsp;</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2020/jun/07/the-big-picture-dancing-in-dublin-1980">Continue reading...</a>

The scale of the human tragedy is incomprehensible: at the pandemic’s peak, almost 1,000 people were <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/uk/">losing their lives</a> a day.

But the UK has performed poorly on any measure: the death toll is now more than double what the government’s scientific advisers said would be a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/uk-coronavirus-death-toll-passes-grim-milestone-of-20000">good outcome</a>”, and, at this point, it has <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/3c53ab12-d859-4ceb-b262-f6a0221ca129">one of the worst</a> excess deaths rates in the world.</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/the-observer-view-on-the-governments-handling-of-the-covid-19-crisis">Continue reading...</a>

<p>As we move into summer, and a restaurant world where alfresco dining will be key, the setting can make a meal memorable</p><p>One summer’s day, about a decade ago, I ate lunch in the garden of an ancient Sussex pub blessed with such perfect set design I hated myself for loving it. We sat upon a terrace of ancient slabs, rubbed smooth by centuries of footfall, overlooking a pasture from which rose the trill of children’s laughter. Beyond it, through the trees, a church spire could be glimpsed, piercing the Tory-blue sky, and you could hear the swell of the London Symphony Orchestra seated over on the cricket pitch, playing Nimrod from Elgar’s Enigma Variations. I may have made up the bit about the LSO.</p><p>I cannot recall anything about the food I ate that day at what was then Moonrakers in Alfriston, at least not without checking. (Having looked it seems there was lemon sole, a bit of chicken with salsify and a chocolate parfait to finish. It was a whole delicious table full of middle-class privilege, fashioned from protein and carbs.) I said at the time that, with a setting this perfect, the cooking didn’t have to be glorious. It just needed not to be bad. It wasn’t. I mostly recall feeling like a willing extra in a Richard Curtis movie called <em>Lunch, Actually</em>. (If you Google the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/may/24/jay-rayner-reviews-moonrakers-alfriston-east-sussex" title="">review</a>, you’ll see I’ve just quoted myself.

It’s not like I repeated the gag about the location being hardcore porn for Ukip members.)</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/food/2020/jun/07/jay-rayner-restaurants-outdoor-dining-alfresco-summer-social-distance">Continue reading...</a>
